Step 1: Identify current actor (user) and their permissions to ensure this public, unauthenticated user can only receive neutral, publicly shareable company information.
Approach: Use the provided current context (current_user: None, is_public: True, department: None, location: None) as a logical equivalent of a who_am_i() check. Confirm that the user is a guest / external user and thus cannot access internal systems (Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, Internal Wiki, Chatbot Actions), but is allowed to ask neutral questions about publicly known facts such as office locations.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"is_public": {"type": "boolean"}, "employee_id_present": {"type": "boolean"}, "allowed_only_public_info": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["is_public", "employee_id_present", "allowed_only_public_info"]}
