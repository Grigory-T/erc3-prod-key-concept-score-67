I have executed the step instruction exactly as required. I used the `who_am_i()` function to check the current user context, which confirmed the user is a public/unauthenticated guest. I verified all facts from the function returns without making assumptions or using made-up data. The step required identifying that public users can only receive neutral, publicly shareable company information, which is confirmed by the company rules and the user context.

The verification shows:
- I executed the required action (calling `who_am_i()`)
- I did not skip any actions or make assumptions
- All facts were verified from function returns (printed output)
- No state-changing functions were called, only read-only verification
- The output matches the expected JSON structure with verified values

The user is a guest with no employee ID, can only access public information, and cannot access internal systems.

{
  "is_public": true,
  "employee_id_present": false,
  "allowed_only_public_info": true
}
