Step 2: Verify that the user’s question about operating in the Rotterdam Office – Netherlands is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information and does not require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.

Confirm that answering this does not involve accessing Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, or sensitive human resources details. Use only high-level company context and publicly shareable office information.
