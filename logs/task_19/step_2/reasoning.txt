We are at Step 2 of the task.
 We are given: "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No"
 We are to verify that this question is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information and does not require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.

 Approach:
 1. The question is about the presence of an office location (Rotterdam Office – Netherlands).
 2. The company locations are publicly known: they are listed in the company context provided at the top.
 3. We must check if answering this question would require accessing any of the internal systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions) or sensitive data.

 According to the company rules, a public user is denied access to those internal systems. However, the office locations are part of the public company information (provided in the context).

 Therefore, we can classify the question as about office location, which is public information.

 Let's define:
   question_text: "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No"
   question_type: "office_location_presence"
   requires_internal_system_access: We need to check if we would need any of the internal systems to answer. We do not.
   answer_allowed_for_public_user: True, because it's a neutral, publicly shareable fact.

 We are not going to actually answer the question in this step, just verify that it's allowed.

 However, note that the step says: "Verify that the user’s question ... is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information"
 We are to output a JSON with the analysis.

 We must be cautious: we are not using any internal systems to verify the office location. We are using the company context provided in the prompt.

 Let's structure the output accordingly.

 We are also instructed to not make assumptions and only use available data. The company context lists the offices, including "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands".

 So, the answer to the question (if we were to answer) is Yes, but we are not answering in this step. We are just verifying that the question is allowed.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Note: We are not calling any functions for this step because we are just analyzing the question text and comparing against the known public company information.

 However, we should note that the step instruction says to use only high-level company context and publicly shareable office information.

 We will set:
   question_text: as given.
   question_type: "office_location_presence"
   requires_internal_system_access: False
   answer_allowed_for_public_user: True

 Let's produce the JSON.

We are at Step 2. The task is to verify that the user's question about operating in the Rotterdam Office – Netherlands is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information and does not require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.

 From the code execution, we have already printed the analysis. Now we need to provide the final answer in the specified JSON format.

 The expected output is:
 {
   "question_text": "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No",
   "question_type": "office_location_presence",
   "requires_internal_system_access": false,
   "answer_allowed_for_public_user": true
 }

 We have already determined these values in the code execution.

 However, note that the step instruction says to use only high-level company context and publicly shareable office information. We have done that.

 We must ensure that the JSON is exactly as required.

 Let's construct the final answer.

[REASONING #6] 2025-12-09 20:02:33
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in Step 2 of the task. We have already executed code and printed the analysis.
 The step asks us to verify that the question is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information and does not require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.
 We have done that and provided the JSON output.

 However, the verification checklist asks if we have executed the step instruction and if we have used any made-up data.

 Let me review what we did:

 1. We analyzed the question text and classified it as "office_location_presence".
 2. We determined that it does not require internal system access (False) because we are only using the company context (which is provided in the prompt) about office locations.
 3. We determined that the answer is allowed for public user (True) because it is neutral and publicly shareable.

 We did not use any function calls to get this information because the step only requires analysis of the question and the company rules.

 The company rules are provided in the prompt, and we used them to determine that public users are denied access to internal systems but can receive neutral information.

 We printed the analysis and then provided the JSON.

 However, note that the step says: "Use only high-level company context and publicly shareable office information."

 We have the company context at the top of the prompt, which lists the offices, including Rotterdam Office – Netherlands.

 Therefore, we are using the provided company context.

 Let me double-check: the expected output is a JSON with four fields, and we have provided exactly that.

 We are confident that the question does not require accessing any of the restricted systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, etc.) because we are only being asked about the existence of an office.

 Therefore, we can stand by our initial response.

 But note: the verification asks to confirm that we did not skip any action and that all facts are verified.

 In our code, we did not call any functions because the step only required analysis. We used the provided context and rules.

 We can consider that we have executed the step as required.

 However, let me check if we should have used any function to verify the company's offices? The prompt provides the company locations at the top.

 Since the step says "Use only high-level company context", we are allowed to use that.

 We have not used any function to get the office locations because they are provided in the prompt.

 Therefore, we have not skipped any function calls because none were required.

 Let me write a code snippet to double-check that the company context (provided in the prompt) indeed lists Rotterdam Office.

 But note: the prompt says "Locations: ... Rotterdam Office – Netherlands". We are using that.

 However, the step does not require us to look up the office in a database. It only requires us to analyze the question.

 We have done that.

 Given the above, I will repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

 But wait: the verification says "If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks."

 I am sure about the results.

 However, let me be thorough and write a small code to confirm that the office is indeed in the provided context.

 But note: the step does not require us to answer the question, only to verify the nature of the question.

 We are not required to answer Yes or No in this step.

 Therefore, I will not look up the office again.

 I will now provide the same <final_answer> and <json> as before.
