I have executed Step 2 exactly as required by the step description. Here's what I did:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I analyzed the question text "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No" and classified it as a request for high-level office location presence.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used the exact question text provided in the task
   - I analyzed the question type based on its content
   - I checked if it requires internal system access by reviewing what systems would be needed to answer it
   - I determined if it's allowed for public users based on company rules

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The question text is exactly as provided in the task
   - The question type "office_location_presence" was derived from analyzing the question content
   - "requires_internal_system_access": false - This was verified by checking that answering about office locations doesn't require accessing CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or sensitive HR details
   - "answer_allowed_for_public_user": true - This was verified against company rules that allow public users to receive neutral, publicly shareable company information

4. **No state-changing functions were called**: This step only involved analysis, not any updates or modifications to data.

5. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All values in the JSON output were explicitly derived from analyzing the question against the provided company context and rules.

The verification confirms that the question about the Rotterdam office is indeed limited to neutral, publicly shareable information that doesn't require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.

  "question_text": "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No",
  "question_type": "office_location_presence",
  "requires_internal_system_access": false,
  "answer_allowed_for_public_user": true
}
