Steps:
  1. Identify current actor (user) and their permissions to ensure this public, unauthenticated user can only receive neutral, publicly shareable company information.
     Approach: Use the provided current context (current_user: None, is_public: True, department: None, location: None) as a logical equivalent of a who_am_i() check. Confirm that the user is a guest / external user and thus cannot access internal systems (Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, Internal Wiki, Chatbot Actions), but is allowed to ask neutral questions about publicly known facts such as office locations.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"is_public": {"type": "boolean"}, "employee_id_present": {"type": "boolean"}, "allowed_only_public_info": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["is_public", "employee_id_present", "allowed_only_public_info"]}
  2. Verify that the user’s question about operating in the Rotterdam Office – Netherlands is limited to neutral, publicly shareable information and does not require access to restricted internal systems or sensitive data.
     Approach: Analyze the task text "Do you operate in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands? Answer Yes or No" and classify it as a request for high-level presence of an office location. Confirm that answering this does not involve accessing Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, or sensitive human resources details. Use only high-level company context and publicly shareable office information.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"question_text": {"type": "string"}, "question_type": {"type": "string"}, "requires_internal_system_access": {"type": "boolean"}, "answer_allowed_for_public_user": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["question_text", "question_type", "requires_internal_system_access", "answer_allowed_for_public_user"]}
  3. Collect the authoritative list of company locations and offices from the provided company context to use as the reference set for answering whether the company operates in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands.
     Approach: Use the company description supplied in the system context (Headquarters and Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria). Construct a normalized list of office locations from this description without querying any internal databases. Do not log any additional data.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"offices": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "source": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["offices", "source"]}
  4. Determine whether a location corresponding to "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" exists in the compiled office list, using exact, partial, and fuzzy / semantic / logical matching to account for potential misspellings or formatting variations.
     Approach: Take the query string "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" and compare it to each entry in the offices list from Step 3. First attempt an exact match. If not found, attempt case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (for example, checking if a normalized version of the query string is contained in a normalized office string). If still not conclusive, conceptually apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical comparison (tolerating minor spelling differences like "Roterdam" or different dash characters) to decide if any office clearly refers to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Do not access any internal systems; rely solely on the list from Step 3.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"query_location": {"type": "string"}, "matched_office": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "match_method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["query_location", "matched_office", "match_found", "match_method"]}
  5. Formulate the final binary Yes or No answer to whether the company operates in Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, based on the match result from Step 4.
     Approach: If Step 4 indicates match_found = true (meaning an office corresponding to Rotterdam Office – Netherlands is present in the office list), set operates_in_rotterdam to true and answer_text to "Yes". If match_found = false, set operates_in_rotterdam to false and answer_text to "No". Provide this as the final outcome without adding extra details beyond the Yes or No wording requested.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"operates_in_rotterdam": {"type": "boolean"}, "answer_text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["operates_in_rotterdam", "answer_text"]}
