DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:01:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed step (Step 1) matches exactly with the original plan's requirements, confirming the actor is a public/guest user who can only receive public, non-sensitive information. There are no discrepancies, missing functions, or unexpected results. The remaining steps are straightforward and feasible with the context and rules provided. Therefore, the plan remains valid, and proceeding to Step 2 is the correct next action.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:02:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan has been strictly followed so far: Steps 1 and 2 are complete and verified per requirements. There are no discrepancies or unexpected results; the information required for the next step (a company office location list from publicly provided context) is available and can be executed exactly as described. No grounds for aborting or replanning exist. The plan remains valid, so proceeding to Step 3 is appropriate.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:05:05
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan remains valid. The steps executed so far have produced the exact expected results, all facts and required information are present, and there were no discrepancies or missing functions. The next step (Step 4) is to match the queried location against the compiled office list, as per the plan. This is possible and logical given the collected data.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:06:43
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have proceeded as expected and produced the correct results. In Step 4, it was conclusively determined via exact match that 'Rotterdam Office – Netherlands' exists in the official list of company offices. The next (final) step is simply to output the answer 'Yes' to the user's question, as planned. No replanning or abort is needed.
