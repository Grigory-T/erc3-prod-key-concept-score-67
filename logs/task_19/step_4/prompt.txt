Step 4: Determine whether a location corresponding to "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" exists in the compiled office list, using exact, partial, and fuzzy / semantic / logical matching to account for potential misspellings or formatting variations.
Approach: Take the query string "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" and compare it to each entry in the offices list from Step 3. First attempt an exact match. If not found, attempt case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (for example, checking if a normalized version of the query string is contained in a normalized office string). If still not conclusive, conceptually apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical comparison (tolerating minor spelling differences like "Roterdam" or different dash characters) to decide if any office clearly refers to Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Do not access any internal systems; rely solely on the list from Step 3.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"query_location": {"type": "string"}, "matched_office": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "match_method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["query_location", "matched_office", "match_found", "match_method"]}
