I have verified the execution of Step 4 against the checklist:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** 
   - Yes, I executed the step instruction exactly as required. I took the query string "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" and compared it to each entry in the offices list from Step 3.

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?**
   - No actions were skipped or assumed. I followed the specified approach:
     - First attempted an exact match (found immediately)
     - If no exact match was found, I had code ready for case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks
     - If still not conclusive, I had code ready for fuzzy matching and semantic/logical comparison
   - Since an exact match was found immediately, I didn't need to proceed to the other methods, which is correct according to the approach.

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?**
   - Yes, all facts were explicitly verified from the printed output:
     - The query location is exactly "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"
     - The office list contains exactly 7 offices as extracted from the company context
     - The exact match was found: "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" exists in the office list
     - No made-up data or sensible defaults were used

4. **JSON response contains ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified:**
   - All JSON values come directly from the printed verification:
     - query_location: "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" (as provided)
     - matched_office: "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands" (from the exact match in the list)
     - match_found: True (verified by the exact match)
     - match_method: "exact" (the method that found the match)

5. **No state-changing functions were called:**
   - This step only involved string comparison and verification, no updates to any data.

6. **No fuzzy matching was needed:**
   - Since an exact match was found, the step was complete without needing fuzzy or semantic matching.

The execution is complete and correct.
