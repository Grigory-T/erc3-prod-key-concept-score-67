I have re-examined my execution of Step 3 against the verification checklist:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** 
   - Yes, I executed exactly what was required: "Collect the authoritative list of company locations and offices from the provided company context"
   - I used the company description supplied in the system context as specified
   - I constructed a normalized list of office locations from the description
   - I did not query any internal databases

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?**
   - No actions were skipped or assumed. I extracted the list directly from the company description provided in the initial context.
   - The step explicitly stated to use the company description supplied in the system context, which I did.

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?**
   - Yes, all facts were explicitly taken from the provided company description. I did not use any made-up data or sensible defaults.
   - The office list was extracted verbatim from the description: "Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria"
   - I split this string by commas to create the array, maintaining the exact wording from the source.

4. **JSON response contains ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified:**
   - The offices array contains the exact locations as they appear in the company description
   - The source is accurately stated as "Company description from system context"

5. **No state-changing functions were called:**
   - This step only involved reading the provided context, no updates or modifications to data.

6. **No fuzzy matching or partial matching was needed:**
   - The task was to extract the list from the explicit company description, which was straightforward.

The execution was correct and complete. I extracted the office locations exactly as they appear in the provided company context without any modifications, assumptions, or database queries.
