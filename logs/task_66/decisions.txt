DECISION AFTER STEP 1

Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
Step 1 was executed according to the plan. The planned output was to obtain the current user's full employee context, including system_roles. However, the actual result shows that system_roles cannot be retrieved with the available API—the array is empty. The rest of the user context is present. Since system_roles are critical for authorization decisions in later steps (specifically for permission checks in step 5), this is potentially a blocking issue. According to the plan, if steps return relevant, correct results, continue; if the step result is unexpected or creates risk, replan. The inability to retrieve system_roles as required is a significant deviation and risk, so replanning is needed before the rest of the steps can proceed meaningfully.
