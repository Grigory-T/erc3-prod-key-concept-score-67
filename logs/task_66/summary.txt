## Execution Summary (limit_reached)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Piero Messina, employee QR23_152) and retrieve his full identity context including employee identifier, department, location, and all system roles, in order to later verify authorization to delete wiki pages.
Approach: Call the centralized identity or employee registry service using a who_am_i operation to obtain the full profile for the currently authenticated user QR23_152. Do not log any data. Extract and structure the employee identifier, full name, department, location, and system roles (such as WikiAdministrator, InformationTechnologyAdministrator, HumanResourcesAdministrator, and so on) from the response. No search is needed here because the current user is known by exact identifier.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** Step 1 executed successfully. I called who_am_i() to obtain the current user context and get_employee() to retrieve full employee details. The authenticated user is Piero Messina (employee ID: QR23_152) from the External department at HQ - Italy. However, system roles are not accessible via the available API functions—the EmployeeFull model and WhoAmI object do not include system_roles. Therefore, an empty array is provided for system_roles. All other fields are verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_152",
  "name": "Piero Messina",
  "department": "External",
  "location": "HQ - Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
