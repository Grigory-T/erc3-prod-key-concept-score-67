Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Piero Messina, employee QR23_152) and retrieve his full identity context including employee identifier, department, location, and all system roles, in order to later verify authorization to delete wiki pages.
Approach: Call the centralized identity or employee registry service using a who_am_i operation to obtain the full profile for the currently authenticated user QR23_152. Do not log any data. Extract and structure the employee identifier, full name, department, location, and system roles (such as WikiAdministrator, InformationTechnologyAdministrator, HumanResourcesAdministrator, and so on) from the response. No search is needed here because the current user is known by exact identifier.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
