Step 1 executed successfully. I called who_am_i() to obtain the current user context and get_employee() to retrieve full employee details. The authenticated user is Piero Messina (employee ID: QR23_152) from the External department at HQ - Italy. However, system roles are not accessible via the available API functions—the EmployeeFull model and WhoAmI object do not include system_roles. Therefore, an empty array is provided for system_roles. All other fields are verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_152",
  "name": "Piero Messina",
  "department": "External",
  "location": "HQ - Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
