DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:23:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was executed successfully and produced results exactly in line with the expected output: we have a precise, mapped field ('notes' in the 'employee' table), and documented evidence confirms this. The next step in the plan is to determine the precise technical update form using documentation—this is fully supported and expected per the completed step. There are no inconsistencies, missing functions, or unexpected blocks, so the original plan remains valid and should proceed to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:31:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both Step 1 and Step 2 have been completed successfully and yielded results exactly as expected in the original plan. The next step (Step 3) is clearly actionable: to identify all employees in the 'External' department using the prescribed multi-stage search strategy. There are no inconsistencies or gaps, and the requirements for continuing are met. There is no evidence that would require aborting the task or replanning. The plan remains fully valid, so the next action is to continue to Step 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:34:04
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan is strictly on track: each step has produced the expected precise, positive results and there are no discrepancies. Step 1 confirmed the mapping of the employee note field; Step 2 confirmed the technical implementation and update capability; Step 3 precisely identified all employees in 'External' (with no ambiguous or mixed department names). There is no evidence or indication that the next step cannot be completed as planned and no requirements to replan. Proceeding to Step 4 is both expected and validated.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:39:36
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
The original plan requires checking permissions for the update by explicitly calling the 'backend_permission_check' function for each target employee in the 'External' department. However, this function is not available in the environment, making it impossible to perform Step 4 as strictly required by the plan. Since Step 4 cannot be executed, Steps 5 and 6 cannot continue as they depend on its result. The absence of this backend permission check function is a blocker defined in the plan's operational requirements, and thus the plan cannot proceed without it.
