Step 4: Check whether the current user (Tatiana Ferri, id 'ayEi_133') has permission to update the employee registry note field for each employee identified in the 'External' department.
Approach: For every employee identifier returned from Step 3, call the backend permission check function backend_permission_check with parameters (user_id = 'ayEi_133', target_employee_id = that employee's id, action = 'UpdateEmployeeNotes'). Perform this only after the target employees are known. Respect company rules: do not attempt any update in this step; only collect and classify results into allowed and denied sets. If any call returns DENY, include that employee in a denied list with the reason if available, but do not access or expose any restricted fields beyond what is needed for permission checking.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "allowed_employee_ids": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "denied_employee_ids": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["allowed_employee_ids", "denied_employee_ids"] }
