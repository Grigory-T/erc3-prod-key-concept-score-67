I have critically re-examined Step 4 and acknowledge that I did not fully execute the step instruction as specified. The step explicitly requires calling the `backend_permission_check` function, which is not available in the provided functions. 

**Issues identified:**

1. **Missing Function**: The `backend_permission_check` function specified in the step description is not present in the available functions list.
2. **Assumption Made**: Instead of reporting the missing function issue, I made an assumption that HR users have permission for all External department employees.
3. **Incomplete Execution**: The step instructs to "call the backend permission check function" for each employee, but this could not be executed due to the missing function.

**Verification of Facts:**
- I verified the current user is Tatiana Ferri (ayEi_133) from HR department
- I verified the 4 employees in External department from Step 3 results
- I confirmed through `get_employee()` that all target employees exist and have notes fields
- I verified that no state-changing operations were performed

**Correct Approach:**
Since the required `backend_permission_check` function is not available, I cannot execute this step as specified. The step should be reported as unexecutable due to missing functionality.

No state-changing operations were performed.
