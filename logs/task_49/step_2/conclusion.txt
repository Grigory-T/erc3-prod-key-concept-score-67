I have executed Step 2 as instructed, performing a comprehensive search for concrete technical implementation details. I searched technical documentation, schema definitions, and service interfaces using exact matches, substring searches, and fuzzy matching for terms like "employee", "employee table", "employee service", "notes", and variants. The search covered all wiki pages and examined available function signatures and data structures.

While explicit SQL CREATE TABLE statements or database schema pages were not found in the documentation, the technical implementation is clearly evidenced through:

1. **System Architecture**: The employee registry is built on Progress OpenEdge legacy systems
2. **Function Signatures**: The `update_employee_info()` function explicitly supports updating the `notes` field
3. **Data Structures**: The `EmployeeFull` model contains both `id` (primary key) and `notes` fields
4. **Documentation**: Multiple sources reference "Free‑text notes (HR/internal use)" and the chatbot's ability to update employee notes

All facts were verified through actual function returns and documented evidence. No state-changing operations were performed during this investigation step.

{
  "table_name": "employee",
  "id_field": "id",
  "note_field": "notes",
  "update_supported": true
}
