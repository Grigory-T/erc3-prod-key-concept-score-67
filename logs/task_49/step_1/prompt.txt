Step 1: Clarify what the term "employee registry note" maps to in internal systems (for example, which exact field or column represents this note).
Approach: Search internal wiki, documentation, and schema references for terms like "employee registry", "employee registry note", and "employee notes" using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (including handling abbreviations and variations such as "emp registry", "HR notes", etc.). Apply the search strategy: first try exact matches on titles and headings, then relax using substring, partial, and fuzzy matching, and finally semantic similarity. From the results, determine the concrete data field (for example, confirm that it is the "notes" column on the "employee" table) that should be updated to store the employee registry note.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found_mapping": { "type": "boolean" }, "target_table": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "target_field": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "evidence_sources": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["found_mapping"] }
