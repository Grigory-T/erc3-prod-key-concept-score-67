I have successfully executed Step 1 as instructed. I conducted a comprehensive search of internal wiki pages and documentation using exact matches, substring searches, and fuzzy matching for terms like "employee registry", "employee registry note", "employee notes", and variations. The search covered HR documentation, system schemas, and actual data structures. All findings were verified through function returns and documented evidence.

The mapping is clearly established: "employee registry note" refers to the "notes" field in the employee table (employee registry). This is supported by multiple verified sources including system documentation, chatbot capabilities, function signatures, and actual employee data structures.

No state-changing operations were performed during this clarification step.

{
  "found_mapping": true,
  "target_table": "employee",
  "target_field": "notes",
  "evidence_sources": [
    "systems/employee_registry.md - documents 'Free‑text notes (HR/internal use)' as a core employee field",
    "systems/chatbot_interface.md - specifies that the chatbot can 'Update employee info (location, department, skills and wills, notes)'",
    "update_employee_info function signature - includes 'notes' as an updatable parameter",
    "EmployeeFull data structure - contains a 'notes' field confirmed by get_employee() function"
  ]
}
