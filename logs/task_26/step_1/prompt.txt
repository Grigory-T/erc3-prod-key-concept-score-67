Step 1: Clarify what is meant by the "coating standards and training project for BalkanMetal Fabrication workshops" using internal documentation to understand any official project naming, abbreviations, or codenames.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file table and any available company documentation systems using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for variations of the phrases "coating standards and training", "BalkanMetal", and "BalkanMetal Fabrication workshops". Account for possible misspellings, partial matches, and alternative wording (for example, "coatings standardization and training", "Balkan Metal", "fabrication workshop"), and double check results by inspecting context in the matched documentation. The goal is to extract the most likely official project name or project identifier used in systems (for example, a project code or exact title).
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"identified_project_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "best_guess_project_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["identified_project_names", "best_guess_project_name", "notes"]}
