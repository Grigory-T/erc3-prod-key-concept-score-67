I have verified the execution of step 3 and confirm it was completed according to the requirements. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified: I queried the project table using fuzzy and semantic/logical searches on name and description fields for terms related to "coating standards and training" and "BalkanMetal Fabrication workshops". I started with exact and contained-string matches, then relaxed filters and applied fuzzy matching using fuzzy_compare on project names and descriptions. I ranked candidates by similarity score and context (customer references), and selected the single most probable project. The clear best match has a similarity score of 1.0, with the next candidate at 0.426, making the result unambiguous.

All facts were verified from function returns - no data was made up or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.
