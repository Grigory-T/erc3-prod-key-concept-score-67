Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the "coating standards and training project for BalkanMetal Fabrication workshops" in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on the name and description fields for terms related to "coating standards and training" and "BalkanMetal Fabrication workshops". Start with exact and contained-string matches (lowercasing and trimming whitespace), then relax filters to partial matches and apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on project.name and project.description) to handle misspellings or small variations. If multiple candidate projects are found, rank them by similarity score and context (e.g., references to BalkanMetal as a customer or to fabrication workshops) and select the single most probable project, or mark the result as ambiguous if more than one candidate has similar high confidence.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "description": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "similarity_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["id", "name", "similarity_score"]}}, "selected_project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["candidate_projects", "selected_project_id", "is_ambiguous"]}
