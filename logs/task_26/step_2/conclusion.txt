Completed: 2025-12-09 20:31:23

I have successfully completed step 2 by executing all required actions: performed fuzzy and semantic searches on wiki documentation, examined CRM and project registry documentation, verified the data structure and relationship through API testing, and confirmed the authoritative data sources. The investigation revealed that project data is stored in the project registry system and customer data (including primary_contact_email) is stored in the CRM system, with a direct relationship where project.customer references customer.id. No alternative authoritative sources were found for customer contact information.

No state-changing operations were performed during this investigation.
