Step 2: Identify the authoritative technical data sources and entities needed to retrieve the primary customer contact email for a project.
Approach: Using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation and schema descriptions, confirm that project data is stored in the project table and customer data, including primary_contact_email, is stored in the customer table. Verify the relationship that project.customer_id references customer.id. Also confirm that these tables are part of the main CRM or project registry system that can be queried. If multiple data sources are found, select the one that is marked as the current authoritative source for customer primary contact information.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_data_source": {"type": "string"}, "customer_data_source": {"type": "string"}, "uses_project_table": {"type": "boolean"}, "uses_customer_table": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["project_data_source", "customer_data_source", "uses_project_table", "uses_customer_table"]}
