DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:26:38
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was fully and precisely completed per the plan, providing a best guess for the official project name and internal identifier. No unexpected results, errors, or missing functions were encountered. All next steps have clear instructions and necessary prerequisites fulfilled. Nothing in the results suggests a need to replan, abort, or finalize. The plan remains directly actionable. Continuing to the next step is correct.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:31:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps completed so far have produced valid, relevant results strictly according to the plan. Each expected output has been generated with no discrepancies or missing capabilities. There have been no unexpected results, missing functions, or roadblocks. The data sources have been confirmed, and there is a clear path to complete the next step by querying the project table to locate the specific project. Therefore, the plan remains valid and should continue to the next step according to the original plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:34:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps strictly match the original plan and have produced the correct/expected results. There are no inconsistencies or unexpected issues. The next planned step (Step 4) is valid: check current user permissions for access to customer primary contact info, and then, if access is granted, retrieve that info in Step 5. Nothing warrants replanning or aborting. The plan should continue as originally designed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:38:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced the exact results expected by the original plan with full verification: (1) the correct project and customer have been unambiguously identified, (2) the user's access rights have been exhaustively checked and confirmed according to company policy, (3) the required contact exists in the CRM, and (4) the last planned step is to fetch and return the primary contact email. Therefore, the plan remains valid and should proceed to the last (already specified) step. There are no inconsistencies or obstacles. No replanning is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:40:16
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All original plan steps were completed exactly as specified, with each required action executed and all facts verified from function returns. The final step retrieved the requested information (primary customer contact email for the specified project), with no errors or missing data. There are no remaining steps, so the task is now complete and the final answer can be provided.
