Step 5: Retrieve the primary customer contact email associated with the customer linked to the identified project, assuming access is allowed.
Approach: Using the target_customer_id for the customer associated with the selected project_id, query the customer table in the authoritative CRM data source and read the primary_contact_email field (and optionally primary_contact_name for context). Ensure the query accommodates potential minor inconsistencies in customer identifiers by performing **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching if an exact customer_id lookup fails (for example, matching on customer.name containing "BalkanMetal" with fuzzy matching in case of spacing or spelling differences). Return the primary_contact_email as the answer, or indicate that it could not be found if no matching customer record exists.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "customer_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_contact_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "primary_contact_email": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["customer_id", "primary_contact_email", "found"]}
