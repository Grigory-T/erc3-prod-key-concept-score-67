STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 20:40:12

I have successfully completed step 5 by executing all required actions exactly as specified in the step description:

1. **Used the target_customer_id from the previous step**: I used `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` which was identified as the customer linked to the project `proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards`.

2. **Queried the customer table in the authoritative CRM data source**: I called `get_customer(target_customer_id)` which returned the full customer record including the `primary_contact_email` field.

3. **Performed exact lookup first, with fallback to fuzzy/semantic matching if needed**: The exact customer ID lookup was successful, so no fuzzy or semantic matching was required. However, I had prepared the code to handle cases where exact matching failed, as per the step requirements.

4. **Returned the primary contact email with context**: The function returned `marko.jovanovic@balkanmetal.com` as the primary contact email, along with the customer name and primary contact name for context.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Customer ID: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (from `get_customer().id`)
- Customer name: `BalkanMetal Fabrication` (from `get_customer().name`)
- Primary contact name: `Marko Jovanovic` (from `get_customer().primary_contact_name`)
- Primary contact email: `marko.jovanovic@balkanmetal.com` (from `get_customer().primary_contact_email`)

No state-changing operations were performed during this step. The step was completed successfully without any assumptions or made-up data.
