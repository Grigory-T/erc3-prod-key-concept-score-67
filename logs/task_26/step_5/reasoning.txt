We are at Step 5. We have from previous steps:
  - selected_project_id: "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards"
  - target_customer_id: "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication"
  - We have confirmed that the current user (Nerea Palacios, BwFV_029) has access to the customer data.

 Approach for Step 5:
  1. Use the target_customer_id to query the customer table (using get_customer function).
  2. If exact match fails, we will need to perform fuzzy/semantic matching, but given the previous steps, we expect the exact match to work.
  3. Retrieve the primary_contact_email and other fields for context.

 However, note the step says: "if an exact customer_id lookup fails (for example, matching on customer.name containing "BalkanMetal" with fuzzy matching in case of spacing or spelling differences)".

 Since we have the customer_id from the project, we should try exact match first.

 Let's execute:

We are given the target_customer_id from the previous step. We should try to get the customer by that exact ID first.
 If that fails, we can try fuzzy and semantic matching on customer names.
 However, note that in step 4 we already successfully retrieved the customer (we saw the email). So we can just get it again.
 But let's follow the step: query the customer table and read the primary_contact_email.
 We'll also check for minor inconsistencies by doing fuzzy matching if the exact lookup fails.

We have successfully retrieved the customer information using the exact customer ID from the previous step.
 The customer was found, and we have the primary contact email.

 Now, we need to output the result in the required JSON format.

 Note: The step description says to use fuzzy and semantic matching if exact lookup fails, but in this case,
 the exact lookup succeeded. So we don't need to do fuzzy matching.

 The expected output requires the following fields:
   - customer_id (string or null)
   - customer_name (string or null)  [optional in required, but included in properties]
   - primary_contact_name (string or null) [optional in required, but included in properties]
   - primary_contact_email (string or null) [required]
   - found (boolean)

 We have all these values from the exact lookup.

 Let's format the response accordingly.

We are sure about the results. The step was completed exactly as specified:
1. Used the target_customer_id from the previous step (cust_balkanmetal_fabrication) to query the customer table.
2. The exact lookup succeeded, so we didn't need to use fuzzy or semantic matching.
3. Retrieved the primary_contact_email (and primary_contact_name for context) from the customer record.
4. All data was explicitly printed and verified from function returns.

No state-changing operations were performed.

Thus, we provide the final answer and JSON.
