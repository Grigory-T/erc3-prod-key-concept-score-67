Step 2 completed successfully. I identified the current user as Silvio Ferri (ID: Bhwa_139) from the Finance & Administration department at HQ – Italy. Based on the company rules analysis and the user's authenticated status, they are permitted to execute SearchBySkill queries. The permission check confirms that any authenticated user can perform skill searches with field restrictions (excluding salary and confidential HR notes). The system_roles field returns an empty array as this information is not available through the current API endpoints.
