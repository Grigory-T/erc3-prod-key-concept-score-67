Step 2: Identify the current user (Silvio Ferri, id "Bhwa_139") and verify permissions to search employee skill data (excluding salary and confidential human resources notes).
Approach: Call the identity/authorization service (who_am_i) to retrieve the bound employee identity, department, location, and system_roles for user id "Bhwa_139". Then, perform an access control check to confirm that this user is allowed to execute a **SearchBySkill**-type query over employee_skill and employee tables, ensuring that only allowed fields (name, email, location, department, and a context-relevant subset of skills/wills) will be returned. If the user is not permitted to search by skills, prepare to abort later steps.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_search_skills": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["user_id", "user_name", "department", "location", "system_roles", "can_search_skills"]}
