Step 4: Determine the maximum skill level for the specified skill and identify the employee or employees who have this highest level (i.e., the "most skilled").
Approach: From the skill_records list obtained in step 3, compute the maximum level value. Then filter the list to only those entries whose level equals this maximum. This identifies one or more employees who are tied for being most skilled in the given skill. Do not perform any additional ranking or tie-breaking beyond the numeric level; simply capture all top-ranked employee_ids.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"normalized_skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "has_candidates": {"type": "boolean"}, "max_level": {"type": "integer"}, "top_employees": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["normalized_skill_name", "has_candidates", "max_level", "top_employees"]}
