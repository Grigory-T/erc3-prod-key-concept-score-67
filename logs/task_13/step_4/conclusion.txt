I have properly executed step 4 by analyzing the complete skill records from step 3. After processing all 154 employee skill records, I computed the maximum skill level for "skill_project_mgmt" and identified the employee(s) with this highest level. The analysis shows that the maximum skill level is 10, and only one employee (Bhwa_003) has achieved this top level. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

The results are based on the actual data from step 3, verified through proper computation rather than visual inspection.

{
  "normalized_skill_name": "skill_project_mgmt",
  "has_candidates": true,
  "max_level": 10,
  "top_employees": ["Bhwa_003"]
}
