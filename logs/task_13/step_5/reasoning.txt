We are given the top_employees list from step 4: ["Bhwa_003"]
 We need to fetch the allowed profile details for each of these employees.
 Allowed fields: name, email, location, department. Also include the skill level from step 4.

 Steps:
 1. For each employee_id in top_employees (currently one employee: Bhwa_003):
    a. Use get_employee(employee_id) to retrieve full details.
    b. If found, extract the allowed fields (name, email, location, department) and the skill level for the normalized skill.
    c. If not found, we may need to use fuzzy search, but given the employee_id came from a previous step, it should exist.

 2. We must ensure we do not access salary or notes. The function get_employee returns an EmployeeFull object which has these fields, but we will not include them.

 3. The skill level for the normalized skill (skill_project_mgmt) is already known from step 4 (max_level=10). However, note that step 4 gave the top employees and their levels. We can get the skill level from the employee's skills list for the given skill.

 4. Since we have only one employee, we can directly query and then extract the required information.

 5. We must also consider that the employee might have multiple skills, so we need to find the skill_project_mgmt in the skills list and get its level.

 6. If the employee is not found (get_employee returns None), we may need to search by name or email. However, given the context, we expect the employee to exist.

 7. We are allowed to return only the allowed fields and the skill level for the specified skill.

 Let's code accordingly.

We have successfully fetched the profile details for the top employee (Bhwa_003) with the highest skill level (10) in "skill_project_mgmt".
 The employee is Angela Fabbri, located at HQ – Italy, in the Corporate Leadership department.
 We only included the allowed fields (name, email, location, department) and the skill level.
 Now we can prepare the expected output in the required JSON format.

We are given the top employee ID from Step 4: Bhwa_003.
 We successfully fetched the employee details using exact match.
 We retrieved only the allowed fields: name, email, location, department, and the skill level for the specified skill.
 We did not access salary or HR notes, in compliance with the company rules.
 The employee was found and the skill level (10) matches the max_level from Step 4.
 We did not need to use fuzzy or semantic matching because the exact match worked.

 However, let me double-check by verifying the employee's skill level in the employee record to ensure it matches 10.
 In the code, we already did that and printed: "Skill 'skill_project_mgmt' level from employee record: 10"

 We also note that the employee is located at "HQ – Italy", which is the same as the user's location (Silvio Ferri) but that's okay.

 The task is to propose candidates to send to Paris for training. We have one candidate with the highest skill level.

 Let me confirm that we have not missed any other top employees. Step 4 gave only one employee (Bhwa_003) with level 10.

 Now, we must output the required JSON.

 The code already collected the candidate data in the `candidates` list.

 Let me structure the final answer accordingly.

 Note: We did not perform any state-changing operations (like updates) in this step, so no state was changed.

 We are confident in the results.

 However, the verification step asks to double-check. Let me quickly run a check to see if there are any other employees with level 10 by re-examining the data from Step 3.

 But note: Step 3 provided 154 records and Step 4 already computed the max level and top employees. We trust that computation.

 Alternatively, we can do a quick search to see if any other employee has level 10 for this skill by using the search_employees function with a skill filter.

 But note: the search_employees function allows filtering by skills with a min_level. Let me check for employees with min_level=10 for skill_project_mgmt.

 However, the user in Step 3 did a paginated search and then computed the max. We can do a quick search to confirm.

 But note: the search_employees function returns EmployeeBrief objects, which do not include skill levels. We would have to get each employee's full profile to see the level.

 Since Step 3 already retrieved all employees with the skill (with level >=1) and we computed the max from that, it should be accurate.

 Given the time, and since the task is to fetch allowed profile details for the top employees from Step 4, and we have done that, we can proceed.

 Let me run a quick confirmation by searching for employees with skill_project_mgmt at level 10 using the search_employees function with a min_level of 10.

 However, note that the search_employees function's skill filter uses a list of dicts with 'name' and 'min_level'. Let me try:

 But note: the function returns EmployeeBrief, and we don't get the exact level. We would have to fetch the full profile to confirm the level.

 Alternatively, we can get the employee we already have (Bhwa_003) and confirm the level again.

 We already did that.

 Let me run a quick code to double-check that no other employee has level 10 by scanning the skill records from Step 3.

 But note: Step 3's output is provided in the previous step. We can see that only Bhwa_003 has level 10.

 We are confident.

 However, the verification step might require that we double-check the existence of the employee and the skill level.

 We already did.

 Let me output the final answer.

 But note: the verification step says to repeat both <final_answer> and <json> blocks if complete.

 I will now provide the final answer and JSON.
