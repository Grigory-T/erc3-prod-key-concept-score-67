STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the exact instructions by:

1. Using the list of top_employees (employee_ids) from step 4: ["Bhwa_003"]
2. Querying the employee table using exact match on employee.id (get_employee("Bhwa_003"))
3. Retrieving only permitted fields: name, email, location, and department
4. Confirming the skill level from the employee's skill records (level 10 for "skill_project_mgmt")
5. Did not access or return salary or human resources notes (confirmed by only accessing allowed fields)
6. The exact match was successful, so no fuzzy or semantic search was needed
7. Prepared the final structured list with one candidate

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Employee name "Angela Fabbri" from get_employee() return
- Email "Bhwa_003@bellini.internal" from get_employee() return  
- Location "HQ – Italy" from get_employee() return
- Department "Corporate Leadership" from get_employee() return
- Skill level 10 from the employee.skills list matching "skill_project_mgmt"

No state-changing operations were performed in this step. No data was invented or assumed - all values come from explicit function returns.

{
  "normalized_skill_name": "skill_project_mgmt",
  "max_level": 10,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "Bhwa_003",
      "name": "Angela Fabbri",
      "email": "Bhwa_003@bellini.internal",
      "location": "HQ – Italy",
      "department": "Corporate Leadership",
      "skill_level": 10
    }
  ]
