Step 1: Clarify and normalize the skill reference "skill_project_mgmt" to the actual internal skill name used in the company (for example, check if it maps to "project management" or a similar standardized skill label).
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file contents and any skill naming guidelines using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching for the term "skill_project_mgmt" (consider underscores, abbreviations, and common variants like "project management", "proj mgmt", etc.). If multiple candidate standard names are found, choose the one with the highest semantic similarity and that appears in skill naming conventions; if nothing clear is found, default to using the literal string "skill_project_mgmt" as the skill_name for subsequent database queries.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"original_skill_ref": {"type": "string"}, "normalized_skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "normalization_confidence": {"type": "number"}, "was_normalized": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["original_skill_ref", "normalized_skill_name", "was_normalized"]}
