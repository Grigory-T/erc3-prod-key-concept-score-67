Step 3: Retrieve all employees who have the specified skill (normalized skill name from step 1) recorded, along with their skill levels, limited to skill_type = "skill".
Approach: If can_search_skills is true, query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name matches the normalized skill name from step 1, using an exact match first. If no rows are found, relax the search criteria using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name (handling misspellings, partial matches, underscores vs spaces, and related phrases like "project management"). Collect all matching (employee_id, skill_name, level) records. Do not join employee details yet; just prepare the list of candidate employees and their levels for this skill.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"normalized_skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "matches_found": {"type": "integer"}, "skill_records": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "level": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "skill_name", "level"]}}}, "required": ["normalized_skill_name", "matches_found", "skill_records"]}
