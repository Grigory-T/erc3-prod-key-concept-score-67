DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:37:43
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 is fully completed and produced the precise expected output: 'skill_project_mgmt' is the correct normalized skill name with high confidence. There are no discrepancies and no violations of company policy. The remaining steps can proceed as planned, since the next step is to confirm the user's identity and permissions for skill search—this is achievable given the current context and company rules.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:41:09
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both completed steps (normalization of skill reference and verification of search permissions) have produced correct and expected results that align with the original plan. There are no unexpected results or inconsistencies, and the context confirms that the plan's next step (retrieving employees with the skill 'skill_project_mgmt') is theoretically and practically possible. The plan remains valid and there is no reason to replan or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:47:42
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced the expected results according to the original plan. There are no discrepancies, errors, or missing information. We now need to proceed to Step 4, which involves determining the maximum skill level and identifying the most skilled employees for 'skill_project_mgmt'. There is no reason to replan, abort, or consider the task finished yet—the remaining steps should be executed as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:59:12
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have returned relevant and correct results according to the original plan. The maximum skill level has been determined and the top employee(s) identified. Step 5, which is to fetch allowed profile details (name, email, location, department) for the top employee(s), has not yet been executed but is feasible and aligns perfectly with the plan and company policies. There are no discrepancies or missing information preventing progress.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:00:52
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been completed successfully and in sequence. Step 5 yields the definitive and complete result required by the task—identifying the employee most skilled in 'skill_project_mgmt' and providing their allowed profile information. No further steps remain, and the task's original goal has been met.
