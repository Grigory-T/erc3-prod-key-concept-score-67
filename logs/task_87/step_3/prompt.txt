Step 3: Check access permissions for the current user to read the email address field of the matched employee record(s) for "Thomas Becker", ensuring compliance with EmployeeProfile access rules.
Approach: Using the identity and system_roles from Step 1 and the candidate employee records from Step 2, apply the EmployeeProfile rule: when accessing via chatbot, all employees may see {name, email, location, department, and a context relevant subset of skills and wills}, provided no confidential fields (salary, human resources notes) are requested. Confirm that only these allowed fields are being accessed. Since email is explicitly allowed for all employees, determine that access to the email field for the identified "Thomas Becker" employee(s) is permitted, and record the permission decision.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_employee_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "requested_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "contains_confidential_fields": {"type": "boolean"}, "access_granted": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["target_employee_ids", "requested_fields", "contains_confidential_fields", "access_granted", "denial_reason"]}
