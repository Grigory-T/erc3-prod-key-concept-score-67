Step 2: Search for an employee record whose name corresponds to "Thomas Becker" in the employee table, using exact, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching, and taking into account possible misspellings, partial matches, and variations.
Approach: Query the employee table first with an exact match filter on employee.name = 'Thomas Becker'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: check for records where the normalized search string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in the normalized employee.name field (substring search). If still not found or ambiguous, use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) on employee.name to find top candidate names similar to 'Thomas Becker', and also allow for semantic / logical matching to account for possible abbreviations or transposition errors. If needed, list all employees and apply these matching strategies in memory. Collect all candidate employees that meet a reasonable similarity threshold, along with their basic fields (id, name, email, location, department). Do not retrieve salary or notes.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"query_name": {"type": "string"}, "candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "email", "location", "department", "match_score"]}}, "exact_match_count": {"type": "integer"}, "best_match_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["query_name", "candidates", "exact_match_count", "best_match_employee_id"]}
