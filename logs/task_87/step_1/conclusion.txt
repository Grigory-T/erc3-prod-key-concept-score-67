Step 1 completed successfully. I identified the current user as Valentina Rinaldi (ID: 6KR2_001), an authenticated internal employee from the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. She has general access to non-confidential employee profile fields as per company rules. System roles information is not available via the current API endpoints. All data was explicitly verified from function returns: employee_id, department, location, and is_internal_employee from who_am_i(); name from search_employees(). No confidential fields were logged in the output.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_001",
  "name": "Valentina Rinaldi",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "is_internal_employee": true
}
