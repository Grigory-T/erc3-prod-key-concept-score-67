Step 1: Identify the current user (Valentina Rinaldi, id 6KR2_001) and confirm she is an internal employee with general access to non-confidential employee profile fields, in line with company rules.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint to retrieve the bound employee identity, including employee_id, department, location, and system_roles for the current session. Verify that the user is an authenticated internal employee (not public guest), and note that, according to the EmployeeProfile rules, non-confidential fields such as name and email are allowed for all employees. Do not request or log any confidential fields (such as salary or human resources notes) during this step.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "is_internal_employee": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles", "is_internal_employee"]}
