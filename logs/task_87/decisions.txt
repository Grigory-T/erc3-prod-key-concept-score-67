DECISION AFTER STEP 1

Time: 2025-12-10 00:01:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed successfully as planned, confirming the user's authenticated status and appropriate access context. No unexpected results, errors, or missing permissions have appeared, and the step matches the expected outcome in the plan. There is no reason to replan or abort; the next logical step is to proceed with Step 2, which is searching for 'Thomas Becker' in the employee table using the described multi-level matching approach.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:06:24
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The process is proceeding according to the plan. In Step 2, no exact match for 'Thomas Becker' was found, but several fuzzy/partial candidates (none a clear match) were identified—all with moderately low similarity. The Original Plan specifies next to check EmployeeProfile field access (Step 3), then to report 'not_found' or 'ambiguous' if no unique match exists (Step 4). No unexpected or erroneous result has occurred, and there is no evidence that replanning is needed as the plan anticipates cases where no match or an ambiguous match occurs. Therefore, continue to Step 3 as per plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:09:13
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The original plan specifies that if no exact match for 'Thomas Becker' is found and multiple plausible candidates remain, the outcome should be marked as ambiguous and clarification should be requested to identify the correct person. The result from Step 2 shows zero exact matches and five candidates with only moderate match scores, none of whom is named 'Thomas Becker.' There is no evidence that one of these is definitely the desired employee, and selecting one could risk providing incorrect information. The plan's explicit instruction is to mark as ambiguous rather than guess, so the next step is to execute Step 4 as written and report the ambiguous outcome.
