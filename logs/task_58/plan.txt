Steps:
  1. Understand the exact meaning of the term "SkillWillReflect" and how "wills" (as opposed to "skills") are defined and managed in the company, to ensure the requested changes (+1 to all wills except decreasing "Interest in cross-site collaboration" by 1) align with internal terminology and process.
     Approach: Use the company wiki or internal documentation search (for example, using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search like search_wiki_fuzzy with queries such as "SkillWillReflect", "skills and wills", "will levels", "Interest in cross-site collaboration") to locate any guidelines or process descriptions. Because the term "SkillWillReflect" may be shorthand, slang, or process name, the search must explicitly account for misspellings, abbreviations, and partial matches (fuzzy matching, semantic similarity, and substring search in titles and content). Interpret the results to confirm that "wills" map to employee_skill rows with skill_type = 'will' and to understand if there are any company-specific nuances to adjusting will levels.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"concept_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "documentation_paths": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "summary": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["concept_found", "summary"]}
  2. Discover the concrete technical implementation (APIs, services, or database access patterns) that allow reading and updating an employee's wills (employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will') in the EmployeeRegistry.
     Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal developer documentation, service registries, or API catalogs for capabilities related to employee skills and wills (for example, terms like "EmployeeSkill", "employee_skill", "UpdateWillLevel", "AddWill", "ListEmployeeSkills", "ListEmployeeWills"). Account explicitly for typos, alternate naming, and abbreviations via fuzzy matching, partial matching (substring search in endpoint names, descriptions, and tags), and semantic similarity. Identify at least one read function (e.g., list skills/wills for an employee) and one write function (e.g., update will level for an employee) that operate on the employee_skill table or equivalent. Capture endpoint names, required parameters, and any constraints that are documented.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"read_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "write_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "read_api_details": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "endpoint": {"type": "string"}, "method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["name", "endpoint", "method"]}, "write_api_details": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "endpoint": {"type": "string"}, "method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["name", "endpoint", "method"]}}, "required": ["read_api_found", "write_api_found"]}
  3. If no suitable technical implementation (APIs or services) for reading and updating employee wills is found, explicitly abort the task as not implementable; otherwise record that the operation can proceed.
     Approach: Evaluate the results from Step 2. If either read_api_found or write_api_found is false, or the discovered APIs do not allow both listing and updating employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will' for the current authenticated employee, decide that the requested SkillWillReflect operation cannot be performed with current systems and prepare an abort outcome noting "not implemented functionality". If both capabilities exist and are usable, mark the task as proceedable and include references to the chosen APIs, but do not yet call them (this step is purely decision and recording).
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"aborted": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "usable_read_api": {"type": "string"}, "usable_write_api": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["aborted"]}
  4. Identify the target employee record corresponding to the current authenticated user (Anna Giuliani, user id Bhwa_109) in the EmployeeRegistry, ensuring we have the correct employee_id for subsequent will updates.
     Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint, or query the employee table using the bound authenticated identity (id = 'Bhwa_109', email or name if needed). Use exact match on the employee id when possible. If that fails, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the employee table fields (id, name, email), allowing for potential typos or formatting differences (for example, lowercase conversion, whitespace trimming, substring and regex search, and fuzzy string comparison on "Anna Giuliani" and "Bhwa_109"). Confirm that the resolved employee record matches the current user context (Logistics & Supply Chain, HQ – Italy).
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_found"]}
  5. Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to update her own wills (employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will') according to company rules.
     Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 and the current user context (who_am_i result), perform a backend_permission_check for actions such as AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, and RemoveWill on EmployeeProfile, targeting this same employee. Confirm that the rule "user.id == target_employee.id" applies so that the self-update of wills is allowed without requiring HRAdmin or Manager roles. Ensure this step happens now that both the target employee and intended action are known. Record whether the permission check passes and, if not, capture the denial reason.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_update_wills": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["can_update_wills"]}
  6. Retrieve all existing wills for the current user and compute the new target levels by increasing all wills by 1, except for the will named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" which should be decreased by 1.
     Approach: Using the read API identified in Step 2, query employee_skill for all rows where employee_id equals the current user's employee_id and skill_type = 'will'. From the returned list, identify the entry whose skill_name corresponds to "Interest in cross-site collaboration" using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL match (case-insensitive comparison, substring search, tolerance to typos and small variations like "cross site" vs "cross-site", and semantic similarity for related phrasing). For each will in the list: if it matches this target name, compute new_level = current_level - 1; for all others, compute new_level = current_level + 1. Respect the schema constraints (level must remain between 1 and 5) by bounding the result within [1,5] if needed, but do not change any other aspect of the records. Prepare a structured mapping of will identifiers to their new levels for use in the update step.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"wills_before": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "level": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["skill_name", "level"]}}, "wills_after": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "old_level": {"type": "integer"}, "new_level": {"type": "integer"}, "is_interest_in_cross_site_collaboration": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_name", "old_level", "new_level", "is_interest_in_cross_site_collaboration"]}}}, "required": ["wills_before", "wills_after"]}
  7. Persist the computed will level changes for the current user by updating each relevant employee_skill row according to the mapping from Step 6.
     Approach: For each will entry in the "wills_after" list from Step 6, call the write API determined in Step 2 (for example, UpdateWillLevel on EmployeeProfile) with the current user's employee_id, the skill_name, and the computed new_level. Perform these updates in a loop within a single logical operation or transaction if supported, but keep the action type uniform (updating will levels only). Ensure that only will entries for the current user are updated and no other fields (such as skills or other employees' records) are modified. Record the outcome for each update, including any failures and their reasons.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"updated_count": {"type": "integer"}, "failed_count": {"type": "integer"}, "updated_wills": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_name": {"type": "string"}, "final_level": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["skill_name", "final_level"]}}, "errors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["updated_count", "failed_count"]}
