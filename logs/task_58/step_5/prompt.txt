Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to update her own wills (employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will') according to company rules.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 and the current user context (who_am_i result), perform a backend_permission_check for actions such as AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, and RemoveWill on EmployeeProfile, targeting this same employee. Confirm that the rule "user.id == target_employee.id" applies so that the self-update of wills is allowed without requiring HRAdmin or Manager roles. Ensure this step happens now that both the target employee and intended action are known. Record whether the permission check passes and, if not, capture the denial reason.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_update_wills": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["can_update_wills"]}
