STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Step 5 completed successfully. I have checked the permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Anna Giuliani, user id Bhwa_109) to update her own wills. The permission check confirms that self-update of wills is allowed according to company rules.

Key findings:
1. The user is authenticated (not public)
2. The current user ID (Bhwa_109) matches the target employee ID (Bhwa_109)
3. Company rules state that for actions like UpdateWillLevel on EmployeeProfile, the requirement is: (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user has HRAdmin/Manager roles
4. Since this is a self-update scenario (user.id == target_employee.id), the permission is granted

No state-changing operations were performed in this step - it was purely a permission check.
