STEP 7 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:19:14

Step 7 completed successfully. I have persisted the computed will level changes for the current user (Anna Giuliani, ID: Bhwa_109) by updating her employee record using the `update_employee_info` function. 

The update was performed as a single logical operation that:
1. Preserved all existing employee data (skills, notes, salary, location, department)
2. Updated all 6 wills according to the mapping from Step 6
3. Applied the 1-5 level bounds as required
4. Sorted the wills alphabetically as per company rules

All 6 wills were updated successfully with no failures. The verification step confirmed that the final levels match exactly what was computed in Step 6:
- "will_cross_site" (Interest in cross-site collaboration) was decreased by 1 (from 7 to 5, bounded at max 5)
- All other wills were increased by 1, with bounds applied where necessary

The state-changing operation `update_employee_info` was called exactly once and completed successfully.
