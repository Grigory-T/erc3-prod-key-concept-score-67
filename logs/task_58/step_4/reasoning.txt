We are in Step 4. We need to identify the target employee record for the current authenticated user (Anna Giuliani, user id Bhwa_109).

 We already know from the context that the current user is Bhwa_109. However, we must verify by calling `who_am_i` and then fetching the employee record.

 Steps:
 1. Call `who_am_i()` to get the current user context.
 2. Use the `current_user` field from the context to call `get_employee(employee_id)`.
 3. If found, extract the required information (id, name, email).
 4. If not found, we might need to search by name or email.

 However, note that the step says: "Use exact match on the employee id when possible." We have the id from `who_am_i()`.

 But note: the step also says to confirm that the resolved employee record matches the current user context (Logistics & Supply Chain, HQ – Italy).

 We should also check that the employee's department and location match the context.

 However, the expected output does not require department and location, but we should still verify for our own correctness.

 Let's proceed.

 Important: We must not make any state-changing operations.

 We will:
   - Call who_am_i()
   - Use the employee_id from who_am_i() to get_employee
   - If found, check that the department and location match (for confirmation)
   - If not found, then we might need to search.

 Since we are in a business system and the user is authenticated, it's very likely that get_employee will return the record.

 Let's code accordingly.

We have successfully identified the target employee record for the current authenticated user.
 The employee was found by exact match on the employee_id from the who_am_i() context.
 The record matches the current user context in name, department, and location.

 Now, we provide the final answer for Step 4.

We have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed.

We:
1. Called `who_am_i()` to get the current user context.
2. Used the exact employee ID from `who_am_i()` (which is "Bhwa_109") to call `get_employee("Bhwa_109")`.
3. The employee was found and we printed all the details.
4. We verified that the employee record matches the current user context (name, department, location).
5. We did not need to use fuzzy or semantic search because the exact match worked.

All facts are from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="Bhwa_109", department="Logistics & Supply Chain", location="HQ – Italy"
- `get_employee("Bhwa_109")` returned: id="Bhwa_109", name="Anna Giuliani", email="Bhwa_109@bellini.internal", department="Logistics & Supply Chain", location="HQ – Italy"

No state-changing functions were called in this step.

The JSON output we provided contains only the values that were explicitly printed/verified.

Therefore, we are confident in the results and will repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
