Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed:

1. Called `who_am_i()` to get the current authenticated user identity
2. Used exact match on the employee ID "Bhwa_109" from the context to query the EmployeeRegistry via `get_employee()`
3. Successfully retrieved the full employee record with all required details
4. Verified the record matches the current user context in all aspects (name, department, location)
5. No fuzzy or semantic search was needed since the exact match worked perfectly

All facts were verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data were used. No state-changing functions were called in this step.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_109",
  "employee_found": true,
  "name": "Anna Giuliani",
  "email": "Bhwa_109@bellini.internal"
}
