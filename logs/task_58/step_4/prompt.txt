Step 4: Identify the target employee record corresponding to the current authenticated user (Anna Giuliani, user id Bhwa_109) in the EmployeeRegistry, ensuring we have the correct employee_id for subsequent will updates.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint, or query the employee table using the bound authenticated identity (id = 'Bhwa_109', email or name if needed). Use exact match on the employee id when possible. If that fails, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the employee table fields (id, name, email), allowing for potential typos or formatting differences (for example, lowercase conversion, whitespace trimming, substring and regex search, and fuzzy string comparison on "Anna Giuliani" and "Bhwa_109"). Confirm that the resolved employee record matches the current user context (Logistics & Supply Chain, HQ – Italy).
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_found"]}
