Step 3: If no suitable technical implementation (APIs or services) for reading and updating employee wills is found, explicitly abort the task as not implementable; otherwise record that the operation can proceed.
Approach: Evaluate the results from Step 2. If either read_api_found or write_api_found is false, or the discovered APIs do not allow both listing and updating employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will' for the current authenticated employee, decide that the requested SkillWillReflect operation cannot be performed with current systems and prepare an abort outcome noting "not implemented functionality". If both capabilities exist and are usable, mark the task as proceedable and include references to the chosen APIs, but do not yet call them (this step is purely decision and recording).
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"aborted": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "usable_read_api": {"type": "string"}, "usable_write_api": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["aborted"]}
