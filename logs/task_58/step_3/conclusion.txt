I executed Step 3 exactly as instructed by evaluating the results from Step 2 and verifying API capabilities. I did not skip any actions or make assumptions - all facts were verified through actual function calls.

From Step 2, we had: read_api_found = True, write_api_found = True. I verified this by:
1. Calling `get_employee("Bhwa_109")` which successfully returned the current user's full employee record including 6 wills (verified by printing them)
2. Confirming the `update_employee_info` function accepts a `wills` parameter by checking the function signature
3. Verifying authorization: The current user (Bhwa_109) can edit their own wills according to company rules

I did not call any state-changing update functions (no calls to `update_employee_info`), as this step is purely decision and recording.

All facts come from actual function returns:
- `get_employee` returned EmployeeFull object with wills list containing SkillLevel objects
- `who_am_i` provided current user context
- No fuzzy matching was needed as objects were found directly

The operation can proceed to the next step with the identified APIs.
