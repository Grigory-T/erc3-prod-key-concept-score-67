We are at Step 3. We need to evaluate the results from Step 2 and decide whether the task can proceed.
 From Step 2, we have:
   read_api_found: true
   write_api_found: true
   read_api_details: { "name": "get_employee", ... }
   write_api_details: { "name": "update_employee_info", ... }

 We must check:
  1. Both read and write APIs exist.
  2. They allow listing and updating employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will' for the current authenticated employee.

 However, note that the read function `get_employee` returns an EmployeeFull object which includes a list of `wills` (SkillLevel objects).
 The write function `update_employee_info` can update the `wills` field (along with other fields).

 But we must also check the company rules for authorization:
   According to the company rules, for actions on EmployeeProfile (which includes updating wills), the user can update their own skills and wills.
   Specifically: 
      IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
        REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;

 Since the current user is Anna Giuliani (Bhwa_109) and she is updating her own wills, this should be allowed.

 However, note that the `update_employee_info` function requires a `changed_by` parameter, and we are required to use the real user identity.

 Additionally, we must note that `update_employee_info` does a FULL REPLACE of the employee record. We must be careful to preserve other fields.

 Given that both APIs exist and are usable for the current user (self-update), we can proceed.

 But wait: the task is to update the current user's wills. We have the read API to get the current wills and the write API to update them.

 Therefore, we should not abort. We mark aborted as false and provide the API names.

 However, note the expected output: 
   Required: ["aborted"]
   Properties: aborted, reason, usable_read_api, usable_write_api

 We must set aborted to false and provide the API names.

 But note: the step says "If either read_api_found or write_api_found is false, or the discovered APIs do not allow both listing and updating employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will' for the current authenticated employee, decide that the requested SkillWillReflect operation cannot be performed"

 Since we have both and they are usable, we proceed.

 Let's output:
   aborted: false
   reason: (optional) but we can leave empty or state that both APIs are available and the user is allowed to update their own wills.
   usable_read_api: "get_employee"
   usable_write_api: "update_employee_info"

 However, note that the write API is `update_employee_info` and it updates the entire employee record. We must be cautious in the next step to do a full replace.

 We are only recording the decision in this step, not calling the APIs.

 So, we output the JSON accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in Step 3. We have to decide whether to abort the task or proceed based on the findings from Step 2.
 According to the output of Step 2, we found both read and write APIs (get_employee and update_employee_info) that can handle wills.
 We have also verified in the code above that:
   - The current user can be retrieved and has wills (6 wills, including one named "will_cross_site" which might be the one we need to adjust).
   - The update_employee_info function accepts a 'wills' parameter and the user is allowed to update their own wills.

 Therefore, the task is implementable and we should not abort.

 However, note that the will we are looking for is named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the task description, but in the sample we see "will_cross_site".
 This might be the same will but with a different naming convention. We must be cautious and in the next step we will have to find the exact name.

 But for Step 3, we are only required to make a decision and record the APIs we will use.

 Let's create the expected output.

 Expected Output format:
 {
   "aborted": false,
   "reason": "",
   "usable_read_api": "get_employee",
   "usable_write_api": "update_employee_info"
 }

 Since we are proceeding, aborted is false.

 However, note that the step says: "If either read_api_found or write_api_found is false, or the discovered APIs do not allow both listing and updating ... decide that the requested SkillWillReflect operation cannot be performed"

 We have both and they are usable. So we proceed.

 Let's output the result.

We have executed Step 3 as instructed:
 1. We evaluated the results from Step 2: both read_api_found and write_api_found are true.
 2. We verified that the current user (Bhwa_109) can use these APIs by:
    - Calling get_employee for the current user and confirming it returns wills (a list of SkillLevel objects).
    - Confirming that the update_employee_info function accepts a 'wills' parameter and can be used by the current user to update their own wills (as per company rules, users can edit their own skills/wills).
 3. We did not call any state-changing update functions (update_employee_info) in this step, as instructed.

 Therefore, the operation can proceed.

 The JSON output should reflect:
   aborted: false
   reason: (empty string, since not aborted)
   usable_read_api: "get_employee"
   usable_write_api: "update_employee_info"

 We have not changed any state, so no state change information is needed in the final answer.
