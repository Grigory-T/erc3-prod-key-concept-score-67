I have thoroughly searched the company wiki using fuzzy and semantic search methods. The documentation confirms that "SkillWillReflect" is a process for updating employee skills and wills outside formal reviews. Wills are defined as employee aspirations/interests stored as SkillLevel objects with a 1-10 rating scale. The example "Interest in cross‑site collaboration" exists in the system. The requested adjustments (+1 to all wills except decreasing this specific will by 1) align perfectly with the company's terminology and process.

  "summary": "SkillWillReflect is a company process for updating skills and wills outside formal reviews. Wills are employee aspirations/interests stored as SkillLevel objects with a 1-10 rating scale, maintained as a separate list in the employee registry. Employees and managers can update will levels, and the example 'Interest in cross‑site collaboration' exists in the system."
