Step 1: Understand the exact meaning of the term "SkillWillReflect" and how "wills" (as opposed to "skills") are defined and managed in the company, to ensure the requested changes (+1 to all wills except decreasing "Interest in cross-site collaboration" by 1) align with internal terminology and process.
Approach: Use the company wiki or internal documentation search (for example, using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search like search_wiki_fuzzy with queries such as "SkillWillReflect", "skills and wills", "will levels", "Interest in cross-site collaboration") to locate any guidelines or process descriptions. Because the term "SkillWillReflect" may be shorthand, slang, or process name, the search must explicitly account for misspellings, abbreviations, and partial matches (fuzzy matching, semantic similarity, and substring search in titles and content). Interpret the results to confirm that "wills" map to employee_skill rows with skill_type = 'will' and to understand if there are any company-specific nuances to adjusting will levels.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"concept_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "documentation_paths": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "summary": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["concept_found", "summary"]}
