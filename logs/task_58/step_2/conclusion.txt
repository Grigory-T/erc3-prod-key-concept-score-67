I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by performing extensive fuzzy and semantic searches across the company's internal documentation. The search included terms like "EmployeeSkill", "employee_skill", "UpdateWillLevel", "AddWill", "ListEmployeeSkills", and "ListEmployeeWills". Through this investigation, I discovered the concrete technical implementation for reading and updating employee wills in the EmployeeRegistry.

The company uses a chatbot interface that sits on top of legacy Progress OpenEdge systems. The chatbot accesses these systems via APIs, as confirmed in the systems overview documentation. While specific REST API endpoint details are not documented in the wiki, the chatbot exposes specific functions that serve as the interface for reading and writing employee wills.

The read capability is provided by the `get_employee()` function, which returns a full employee record including the wills list as part of the EmployeeFull object. The write capability is provided by the `update_employee_info()` function, which accepts a `wills` parameter along with other employee information to update the employee's wills.

My searches confirmed that terms like "AddWill" and "employee_skill" appear throughout the documentation, but the actual implementation is abstracted through these chatbot functions. No state-changing operations were performed during this discovery step.
