Step 2: Discover the concrete technical implementation (APIs, services, or database access patterns) that allow reading and updating an employee's wills (employee_skill entries with skill_type = 'will') in the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal developer documentation, service registries, or API catalogs for capabilities related to employee skills and wills (for example, terms like "EmployeeSkill", "employee_skill", "UpdateWillLevel", "AddWill", "ListEmployeeSkills", "ListEmployeeWills"). Account explicitly for typos, alternate naming, and abbreviations via fuzzy matching, partial matching (substring search in endpoint names, descriptions, and tags), and semantic similarity. Identify at least one read function (e.g., list skills/wills for an employee) and one write function (e.g., update will level for an employee) that operate on the employee_skill table or equivalent. Capture endpoint names, required parameters, and any constraints that are documented.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"read_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "write_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "read_api_details": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "endpoint": {"type": "string"}, "method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["name", "endpoint", "method"]}, "write_api_details": {"type": "object", "properties": {"name": {"type": "string"}, "endpoint": {"type": "string"}, "method": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["name", "endpoint", "method"]}}, "required": ["read_api_found", "write_api_found"]}
