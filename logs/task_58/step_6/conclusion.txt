Step 6 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed:

1. **Retrieved all existing wills**: Used the `get_employee` API (identified in Step 2) to query the current user's (Bhwa_109) full employee record, which includes 6 wills with their current levels.

2. **Identified target will**: Applied FUZZY and SEMANTIC/LOGICAL matching to find "Interest in cross-site collaboration":
   - Initial fuzzy comparison with the full phrase returned low ratios (best: 0.39 for 'will_cross_site')
   - Performed targeted substring analysis: 'will_cross_site' contains both 'cross' and 'site'
   - Fuzzy matching for individual words: 'cross-site' → 'will_cross_site' (ratio: 0.72)
   - Semantic analysis: 'will_cross_site' is the only will related to cross-site activities
   - Conclusion: 'will_cross_site' corresponds to "Interest in cross-site collaboration"

3. **Computed new levels**:
   - For 'will_cross_site' (target): current_level (7) - 1 = 6 → bounded to 5 (max constraint)
   - For all other wills: current_level + 1, with bounds applied:
     - 'will_digitalisation': 4 → 5
     - 'will_mentor_juniors': 3 → 4
     - 'will_people_management': 5 → 6 → 5 (bounded)
     - 'will_process_improvement': 5 → 6 → 5 (bounded)
     - 'will_travel': 3 → 4

4. **Prepared structured mapping**: Created both "wills_before" and "wills_after" arrays with exact values from function returns.

All facts were verified from actual function returns - no data was made up or assumed. No state-changing functions were called in this step.
