DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:01:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The results so far show that the terminology and process ('SkillWillReflect', 'wills', and their level adjustment including the special case for 'Interest in cross-site collaboration') have been fully confirmed and match the user's intent. No technical or policy showstopper has appeared. The plan remains valid and there is no new information, missing functionality, or unexpected result requiring replanning. Therefore, the next step is to discover the relevant APIs/services for reading and updating will levels, as outlined in Step 2.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:06:01
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both the read and write API capabilities for employee wills are available and match the requirements specified in the original plan. No inconsistencies or missing functionalities have been found. Therefore, the next step (Step 3) should be executed as it is described, confirming whether the task can proceed. No replanning or abort is necessary since progress perfectly aligns with the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:07:36
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced the expected results in strict alignment with the original plan. We have confirmed terminology, technical capability, and system APIs for both read and write; no discrepancies or missing elements have been found. There are explicit APIs to proceed (get_employee and update_employee_info). The next step is to verify the current employee record, which is achievable per plan. There are no blockers or reasons to replan, abort, or call the task completed yet.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:08:54
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced results that match the expected outputs in the original plan, with no missing capabilities or unexpected errors. The remaining steps are clearly actionable using the confirmed APIs and user context, and no additional rules or company policies indicate otherwise. There are no inconsistencies or implementation gaps that require adjustment. Thus, the appropriate action is to CONTINUE with the next step of the original plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:10:38
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced expected, correct results that match the required outputs and strictly follow the Original Plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing information, and all necessary APIs, permissions, and identity checks are confirmed. Nothing so far requires a replan or abort. The next logical step is to proceed to Step 6, as specified in the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:15:02
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps up to now have executed successfully and precisely as described in the original plan. The prerequisites for proceeding to the final planned action (persisting the will changes) have been established: APIs were discovered, verified, and are usable; the employee record and permissions are confirmed; and the computed will level changes are ready, based on accurate retrieval and mapping. Step 6 produced perfectly expected outputs. No unexpected results or missing functions. Therefore, the plan remains valid, and I should CONTINUE to the next step to update the will levels as described.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:19:19
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps from the original plan have been executed successfully, each with the expected outcome. There are no remaining steps in the plan, and the final state matches the task goal: all 'will' levels for Anna Giuliani were correctly updated according to the specification (+1 to all except -1 to 'Interest in cross-site collaboration'), with results fully bounded and alphabetically sorted as per company process requirements. There were no errors or failures, and all changes were persisted. No further action is required.
