## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for the company-specific definitions of the terms "workload" and "current projects" as they relate to employees and projects, to understand exactly what should be calculated for the workload of an employee across projects.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file records and any available internal documentation search tools with queries such as "workload definition", "employee workload", "current projects", "project workload". Account for typos, pluralization, and variations (for example, "work load", "current proj."). Prefer exact matches in titles and headings first, then contents. If multiple relevant definitions are found, select the one most specifically related to employee allocation across projects. If no explicit definition is found, note that and default later to using the most logical technical representation of workload (for example, team_member.time_slice) while clearly documenting this assumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"workload_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["definition_found","workload_definition_text","current_projects_definition_text"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 1 by conducting an extensive search of the company wiki and documentation for definitions of "workload" and "current projects". 

**Search Methodology:**
1. Listed all 19 wiki files available in the system
2. Performed fuzzy searches using terms like "workload", "work load", "employee workload", "current projects", "active projects", etc.
3. Conducted regex searches for definition patterns (e.g., "workload is defined", "current projects are")
4. Examined relevant files directly, including systems/project_registry.md, systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md, hr/people_and_roles.md, and systems/overview.md
5. Performed an exhaustive search across all wiki files for any occurrence of "current" and "project" together
6. Looked for glossary or terminology files that might contain definitions
7. Re-examined fuzzy search results with more specific terms

**Results:**
- **Workload Definition:** Found a clear, explicit definition in `systems/project_registry.md` that defines employee workload as "their allocated FTE slices across all active projects" with detailed explanation of the Workload entries (Employee, TimeSlice, Role).
- **Current Projects Definition:** Despite exhaustive searching through all available documentation, no explicit definition of "current projects" was found. The search revealed 4 lines containing both "current" and "project" across wiki files, but none provided a formal definition. No glossary or terminology files exist in the system, and no status section defining project states was found in the project registry documentation.

All facts are verified from actual function returns - no data was invented or assumed. The workload definition text comes directly from the loaded wiki content, and the absence of a current projects definition is confirmed by multiple search methods returning no definitional content.

Since no explicit definition was found for "current projects," for subsequent steps I will default to the most logical technical representation based on the workload definition's reference to "active projects."

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "workload_definition_text": "## Workload\n\nEmployee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:\n\n* `Employee` – the employee ID\n* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)\n\nThese allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.",
  "current_projects_definition_text": null
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify which technical data structures or services in the available systems represent an employee's workload and project participation, to know exactly where and how to retrieve workload data.
Approach: Inspect the known SQL schema and, if available, any service or API catalog using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for relevant entities and fields such as "team_member", "time_slice", "workload", "capacity", "allocation". Pay particular attention to the team_member table (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice) and the time_entry table to see which is used by internal guidelines (from Step 1) for workload reporting. Confirm whether workload across current projects should be derived from team_member.time_slice (fraction of full-time per project) and whether any additional constraints (such as project status) are part of the technical definition. If no appropriate field or service is found that can express workload, record that the required functionality is not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string","enum":["team_member_time_slice","time_entry_hours","unknown"]},"primary_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supports_project_status_filtering":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["workload_source_type","primary_tables","workload_fields","supports_project_status_filtering"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed. Here is my verification:

**Actions Performed:**
1. **Examined Data Structures**: Retrieved sample project and examined its structure, confirming `TeamMember` objects with `time_slice`, `employee`, and `role` fields.
2. **Checked Time Entry Structure**: Attempted to retrieve time entries (none found in the system).
3. **Tested Search Functions**: Verified `search_projects()` supports filtering by `status` (as a list) and `team_employee`.
4. **Tested Status Filtering**: Confirmed all project statuses ("idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived") are filterable.
5. **Checked Combined Filtering**: Tested filtering by both `status=["active"]` and `team_employee` simultaneously.
6. **Examined Employee Structure**: Retrieved employee data and confirmed no workload fields exist directly on employee records.
7. **Searched Documentation**: Used `search_wiki()` to look for technical schema references (found limited results).
8. **Checked Time Summary Functions**: Tested `time_summary_by_employee()` function to understand available reporting capabilities.

**All Facts Verified (No Assumptions):**
- **TeamMember.time_slice**: Verified from actual project data: `TeamMember(employee='FphR_046', time_slice=0.5, role='Lead')`
- **Project.status filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], limit=2)` which returned active projects
- **team_employee filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 2 projects
- **Combined filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 1 active project
- **All status values**: Verified each status returns projects: "idea" (1), "exploring" (1), "active" (2), "paused" (1), "archived" (0)
- **Time entries**: Verified no time entries exist in system (search returned empty)
- **Employee structure**: Verified from `get_employee("FphR_046")` that employee records contain skills/wills but no workload fields

**No State-Changing Functions Called**: I only used read/search functions, no update functions were called.

**Conclusion**: The technical representation of employee workload is confirmed to be `team_member.time_slice` in project team definitions, with project status filtering fully supported via the `search_projects()` API.

{
  "workload_source_type": "team_member_time_slice",
  "primary_tables": ["project", "team_member"],
  "workload_fields": ["time_slice", "status"],
  "supports_project_status_filtering": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the exact employee record corresponding to "Marchetti Camilla" in the employee table to obtain a stable employee_id for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using a combination of exact and FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field, and if needed on id and email fields. First try exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla'. If no record is found, relax the search by lowercasing and trimming whitespace and checking whether 'marchetti' and 'camilla' are contained in the name, then use fuzzy string comparison (for example, Levenshtein distance) to handle typos or different order (such as 'Camilla Marchetti'). If multiple candidates are returned, rank them by fuzzy similarity score and select the top candidate only if its similarity score is clearly higher than others (for example, by a defined margin); otherwise, mark the result as ambiguous and require clarification. Capture whether a unique employee was found and, if so, the corresponding employee_id and canonical name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidate_count","employee_id","employee_name"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 3 according to the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: First tried exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla' → No employee found (0 matches)
2. **Partial matching**: Relaxed search by lowercasing and checking for both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in the name → Found 1 employee: "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013)
3. **Fuzzy string comparison**: Used fuzzy matching to handle different ordering:
   - For target "Marchetti Camilla": Top match was "Margherita Gallo" (ratio 0.606), then "Fabio Marchetti" (0.562), then "Camilla Marchetti" (0.529)
   - For target "Camilla Marchetti" (reversed order): Perfect match "Camilla Marchetti" (ratio 1.0), with next best "Fabio Marchetti" (ratio 0.75)
4. **Ambiguity assessment**: The ratio difference between the best candidate (1.0) and next best (0.75) is 0.25, which exceeds the 0.15 threshold → Not ambiguous
5. **Candidate count**: Only one employee contains both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in their name
6. **Verification**: Retrieved full employee details for FphR_013 to confirm identity

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- `list_all_employees()` returned 154 employees
- `search_employees(query="marchetti")` returned 3 employees including FphR_013
- `search_employees(query="camilla")` returned only FphR_013  
- `get_employee("FphR_013")` confirmed details: Camilla Marchetti, HQ – Italy, Sales & Customer Success
- `fuzzy_compare()` provided exact ratios for matching

No state-changing functions were called. The target name "Marchetti Camilla" appears to be in surname-first format, while the system stores names in first-last format as "Camilla Marchetti".

{
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "candidate_count": 1,
  "employee_id": "FphR_013",
  "employee_name": "Camilla Marchetti"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the current user (Nino Valente, id FphR_001) has sufficient permissions and role to view the workload of the identified employee across projects.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and authorization lookup to confirm the current user's employee_id, department, and roles (for example, 'Executive Leadership', 'DepartmentLeader'). Using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching if role naming is not standardized, verify that the user belongs to an executive or otherwise authorized group that is allowed to see cross-project workload for other employees (for example, executives or direct managers). Evaluate access based on the company rules that executives and corporate leadership can access any project and client information. If the user does not have appropriate roles or if the policy lookup fails, set the outcome as denied_security and do not proceed to read detailed workload data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"permission_to_view_workload":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_roles","permission_to_view_workload","denial_reason"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 4 to check the current user's permissions to view another employee's workload across projects. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Current User Context**: Verified via `who_am_i()` - user is FphR_001 (Nino Valente), department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy".

2. **Employee Details**: Retrieved full employee record via `get_employee("FphR_001")` - confirmed name, department, and that system_roles field is not available in the EmployeeFull model.

3. **Wiki Search**: Searched wiki for role definitions:
   - Found "Corporate Leadership" mentioned in `hr/people_and_roles.md` and `company/organization_and_hierarchy.md`
   - Found "executive" mentioned in `company/history.md`
   - No explicit definition of "system_roles" found

4. **Department Verification**: Listed all employees and found 5 employees in "Corporate Leadership" department, including Nino Valente.

5. **Project Access Test**: Successfully retrieved a sample project (`get_project()`), confirming ability to access project details including team information.

6. **Company Rules Analysis**: According to provided company rules, "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information." The user's department "Corporate Leadership" appears to be an executive/leadership role.

7. **Permission Conclusion**: Since workload data comes from project team allocations (team_member.time_slice), and executives can access any project information, the user has permission to view workload.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns - no data was invented or assumed.

{
  "current_user_id": "FphR_001",
  "current_user_roles": ["Corporate Leadership"],
  "permission_to_view_workload": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve and aggregate the workload of the identified employee (Marchetti Camilla) across all current projects, using the technical workload representation discovered earlier and any definition of "current projects" from documentation.
Approach: Assuming permission is granted and a unique employee_id was found, query the primary workload source determined in Step 2. If workload_source_type is 'team_member_time_slice', perform a JOIN between team_member and project on project_id, filtered by team_member.employee_id equal to the identified employee_id. If the documentation from Step 1 defines "current projects" in terms of project.status (for example, excluding 'archived'), apply that filter; otherwise, include all projects where the employee is a team member, without introducing additional status checks. For each matching project, retrieve project.id, project.name, project.customer_id, team_member.role, and team_member.time_slice. Compute the total allocated time_slice across all these projects (sum of time_slice) and prepare a per-project list showing each project's allocation. If workload_source_type is 'time_entry_hours', instead aggregate hours from time_entry grouped by project_id over the relevant recent period defined in the documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL interpretation if the period is described in words, such as "current month"). If workload_source_type is 'unknown', do not attempt to fabricate results and mark that workload cannot be computed due to missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"total_hours":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_allocated_time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"workload_computable":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","projects","total_allocated_time_slice","workload_computable"]}
**Result:** I have now correctly executed Step 5 following the exact instructions. Here's what I did:

**Correction to Initial Approach:**
In my initial execution, I incorrectly filtered to only "active" projects based on the workload definition mentioning "active projects". However, the step instructions explicitly state: "If the documentation from Step 1 defines 'current projects' in terms of project.status... apply that filter; otherwise, include all projects where the employee is a team member, without introducing additional status checks."

Since Step 1 did NOT find an explicit definition of "current projects" (only workload definition mentioned "active projects"), I should NOT apply status filters. I corrected this by searching for ALL projects where FphR_013 is a team member, regardless of status.

**Corrected Methodology:**
1. Searched for ALL projects (any status, including archived) where FphR_013 is a team member
2. Found 3 projects total (2 active, 1 exploring)
3. Retrieved detailed project information for each, including role and time slice (FTE)
4. Calculated total allocated time slice as the sum of FTE across all 3 projects

**Results:**
- Employee Camilla Marchetti (FphR_013) is allocated to 3 projects across different statuses
- Total allocated time slice: 0.9 FTE (90% of full-time equivalent)
- Projects include:
  - 2 active projects (0.2 + 0.4 FTE)
  - 1 exploring project (0.3 FTE)

No state-changing functions were called during this step. All facts were verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_013",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_machina_press_high_temp",
      "project_name": "High-temperature coating for presses",
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.2,
      "total_hours": null
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system",
      "project_name": "Multi-substrate coating portfolio",
      "customer_id": "cust_visegrad_industrial",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3,
      "total_hours": null
    },

      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4,
      "total_hours": null
    }
  ],
  "total_allocated_time_slice": 0.9,
  "workload_computable": true
}

### Final Result
Camilla Marchetti (employee ID: FphR_013) is currently allocated across 3 projects:

1. High-temperature coating for presses (customer: Machina Press) – Role: Engineer, 0.2 FTE
2. Multi-substrate coating portfolio (customer: Visegrad Industrial) – Role: Engineer, 0.3 FTE
3. Workshop coating standards and training (customer: Balkanmetal Fabrication) – Role: Lead, 0.4 FTE

This results in a total planned workload of 0.9 FTE (90% of a full-time equivalent) across all projects where she is an active team member (including projects of any status, as there is no official definition for 'current projects').

No further action or replanning is needed; this is the definitive answer based on the available data and company policy.

## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for the company-specific definitions of the terms "workload" and "current projects" as they relate to employees and projects, to understand exactly what should be calculated for the workload of an employee across projects.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file records and any available internal documentation search tools with queries such as "workload definition", "employee workload", "current projects", "project workload". Account for typos, pluralization, and variations (for example, "work load", "current proj."). Prefer exact matches in titles and headings first, then contents. If multiple relevant definitions are found, select the one most specifically related to employee allocation across projects. If no explicit definition is found, note that and default later to using the most logical technical representation of workload (for example, team_member.time_slice) while clearly documenting this assumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"workload_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["definition_found","workload_definition_text","current_projects_definition_text"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 1 by conducting an extensive search of the company wiki and documentation for definitions of "workload" and "current projects". 

**Search Methodology:**

6. Looked for glossary or terminology files that might contain definitions
7. Re-examined fuzzy search results with more specific terms

**Results:**

Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:\n\n* `Employee` – the employee ID\n* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)\n\nThese allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.",
  "current_projects_definition_text": null
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify which technical data structures or services in the available systems represent an employee's workload and project participation, to know exactly where and how to retrieve workload data.
Approach: Inspect the known SQL schema and, if available, any service or API catalog using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for relevant entities and fields such as "team_member", "time_slice", "workload", "capacity", "allocation". Pay particular attention to the team_member table (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice) and the time_entry table to see which is used by internal guidelines (from Step 1) for workload reporting. Confirm whether workload across current projects should be derived from team_member.time_slice (fraction of full-time per project) and whether any additional constraints (such as project status) are part of the technical definition. If no appropriate field or service is found that can express workload, record that the required functionality is not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string","enum":["team_member_time_slice","time_entry_hours","unknown"]},"primary_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supports_project_status_filtering":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["workload_source_type","primary_tables","workload_fields","supports_project_status_filtering"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed. Here is my verification:

**Actions Performed:**
1. **Examined Data Structures**: Retrieved sample project and examined its structure, confirming `TeamMember` objects with `time_slice`, `employee`, and `role` fields.
2. **Checked Time Entry Structure**: Attempted to retrieve time entries (none found in the system).
3. **Tested Search Functions**: Verified `search_projects()` supports filtering by `status` (as a list) and `team_employee`.
4. **Tested Status Filtering**: Confirmed all project statuses ("idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived") are filterable.
5. **Checked Combined Filtering**: Tested filtering by both `status=["active"]` and `team_employee` simultaneously.
6. **Examined Employee Structure**: Retrieved employee data and confirmed no workload fields exist directly on employee records.
7. **Searched Documentation**: Used `search_wiki()` to look for technical schema references (found limited results).
8. **Checked Time Summary Functions**: Tested `time_summary_by_employee()` function to understand available reporting capabilities.

**All Facts Verified (No Assumptions):**
- **TeamMember.time_slice**: Verified from actual project data: `TeamMember(employee='FphR_046', time_slice=0.5, role='Lead')`
- **Project.status filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], limit=2)` which returned active projects
- **team_employee filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 2 projects
- **Combined filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 1 active project
- **All status values**: Verified each status returns projects: "idea" (1), "exploring" (1), "active" (2), "paused" (1), "archived" (0)
- **Time entries**: Verified no time entries exist in system (search returned empty)
- **Employee structure**: Verified from `get_employee("FphR_046")` that employee records contain skills/wills but no workload fields

**No State-Changing Functions Called**: I only used read/search functions, no update functions were called.

**Conclusion**: The technical representation of employee workload is confirmed to be `team_member.time_slice` in project team definitions, with project status filtering fully supported via the `search_projects()` API.

{
  "workload_source_type": "team_member_time_slice",
  "primary_tables": ["project", "team_member"],
  "workload_fields": ["time_slice", "status"],
  "supports_project_status_filtering": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the exact employee record corresponding to "Marchetti Camilla" in the employee table to obtain a stable employee_id for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using a combination of exact and FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field, and if needed on id and email fields. First try exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla'. If no record is found, relax the search by lowercasing and trimming whitespace and checking whether 'marchetti' and 'camilla' are contained in the name, then use fuzzy string comparison (for example, Levenshtein distance) to handle typos or different order (such as 'Camilla Marchetti'). If multiple candidates are returned, rank them by fuzzy similarity score and select the top candidate only if its similarity score is clearly higher than others (for example, by a defined margin); otherwise, mark the result as ambiguous and require clarification. Capture whether a unique employee was found and, if so, the corresponding employee_id and canonical name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidate_count","employee_id","employee_name"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 3 according to the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: First tried exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla' → No employee found (0 matches)
2. **Partial matching**: Relaxed search by lowercasing and checking for both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in the name → Found 1 employee: "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013)
3. **Fuzzy string comparison**: Used fuzzy matching to handle different ordering:
   - For target "Marchetti Camilla": Top match was "Margherita Gallo" (ratio 0.606), then "Fabio Marchetti" (0.562), then "Camilla Marchetti" (0.529)
   - For target "Camilla Marchetti" (reversed order): Perfect match "Camilla Marchetti" (ratio 1.0), with next best "Fabio Marchetti" (ratio 0.75)
4. **Ambiguity assessment**: The ratio difference between the best candidate (1.0) and next best (0.75) is 0.25, which exceeds the 0.15 threshold → Not ambiguous
5. **Candidate count**: Only one employee contains both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in their name
6. **Verification**: Retrieved full employee details for FphR_013 to confirm identity

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- `list_all_employees()` returned 154 employees
- `search_employees(query="marchetti")` returned 3 employees including FphR_013
- `search_employees(query="camilla")` returned only FphR_013  
- `get_employee("FphR_013")` confirmed details: Camilla Marchetti, HQ – Italy, Sales & Customer Success
- `fuzzy_compare()` provided exact ratios for matching

No state-changing functions were called. The target name "Marchetti Camilla" appears to be in surname-first format, while the system stores names in first-last format as "Camilla Marchetti".

{
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "candidate_count": 1,
  "employee_id": "FphR_013",
  "employee_name": "Camilla Marchetti"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the current user (Nino Valente, id FphR_001) has sufficient permissions and role to view the workload of the identified employee across projects.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and authorization lookup to confirm the current user's employee_id, department, and roles (for example, 'Executive Leadership', 'DepartmentLeader'). Using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching if role naming is not standardized, verify that the user belongs to an executive or otherwise authorized group that is allowed to see cross-project workload for other employees (for example, executives or direct managers). Evaluate access based on the company rules that executives and corporate leadership can access any project and client information. If the user does not have appropriate roles or if the policy lookup fails, set the outcome as denied_security and do not proceed to read detailed workload data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"permission_to_view_workload":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_roles","permission_to_view_workload","denial_reason"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 4 to check the current user's permissions to view another employee's workload across projects. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Current User Context**: Verified via `who_am_i()` - user is FphR_001 (Nino Valente), department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy".

2. **Employee Details**: Retrieved full employee record via `get_employee("FphR_001")` - confirmed name, department, and that system_roles field is not available in the EmployeeFull model.

3. **Wiki Search**: Searched wiki for role definitions:
   - Found "Corporate Leadership" mentioned in `hr/people_and_roles.md` and `company/organization_and_hierarchy.md`
   - Found "executive" mentioned in `company/history.md`
   - No explicit definition of "system_roles" found

4. **Department Verification**: Listed all employees and found 5 employees in "Corporate Leadership" department, including Nino Valente.

5. **Project Access Test**: Successfully retrieved a sample project (`get_project()`), confirming ability to access project details including team information.

6. **Company Rules Analysis**: According to provided company rules, "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information." The user's department "Corporate Leadership" appears to be an executive/leadership role.

7. **Permission Conclusion**: Since workload data comes from project team allocations (team_member.time_slice), and executives can access any project information, the user has permission to view workload.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns - no data was invented or assumed.

{
  "current_user_id": "FphR_001",
  "current_user_roles": ["Corporate Leadership"],
  "permission_to_view_workload": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve and aggregate the workload of the identified employee (Marchetti Camilla) across all current projects, using the technical workload representation discovered earlier and any definition of "current projects" from documentation.
Approach: Assuming permission is granted and a unique employee_id was found, query the primary workload source determined in Step 2. If workload_source_type is 'team_member_time_slice', perform a JOIN between team_member and project on project_id, filtered by team_member.employee_id equal to the identified employee_id. If the documentation from Step 1 defines "current projects" in terms of project.status (for example, excluding 'archived'), apply that filter; otherwise, include all projects where the employee is a team member, without introducing additional status checks. For each matching project, retrieve project.id, project.name, project.customer_id, team_member.role, and team_member.time_slice. Compute the total allocated time_slice across all these projects (sum of time_slice) and prepare a per-project list showing each project's allocation. If workload_source_type is 'time_entry_hours', instead aggregate hours from time_entry grouped by project_id over the relevant recent period defined in the documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL interpretation if the period is described in words, such as "current month"). If workload_source_type is 'unknown', do not attempt to fabricate results and mark that workload cannot be computed due to missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"total_hours":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_allocated_time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"workload_computable":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","projects","total_allocated_time_slice","workload_computable"]}
**Result:** I have now correctly executed Step 5 following the exact instructions. Here's what I did:

**Correction to Initial Approach:**
In my initial execution, I incorrectly filtered to only "active" projects based on the workload definition mentioning "active projects". However, the step instructions explicitly state: "If the documentation from Step 1 defines 'current projects' in terms of project.status... apply that filter; otherwise, include all projects where the employee is a team member, without introducing additional status checks."

Since Step 1 did NOT find an explicit definition of "current projects" (only workload definition mentioned "active projects"), I should NOT apply status filters. I corrected this by searching for ALL projects where FphR_013 is a team member, regardless of status.

**Corrected Methodology:**
1. Searched for ALL projects (any status, including archived) where FphR_013 is a team member
2. Found 3 projects total (2 active, 1 exploring)
3. Retrieved detailed project information for each, including role and time slice (FTE)
4. Calculated total allocated time slice as the sum of FTE across all 3 projects

**Results:**
- Employee Camilla Marchetti (FphR_013) is allocated to 3 projects across different statuses
- Total allocated time slice: 0.9 FTE (90% of full-time equivalent)
- Projects include:
  - 2 active projects (0.2 + 0.4 FTE)
  - 1 exploring project (0.3 FTE)

No state-changing functions were called during this step. All facts were verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_013",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_machina_press_high_temp",
      "project_name": "High-temperature coating for presses",
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.2,
      "total_hours": null
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system",
      "project_name": "Multi-substrate coating portfolio",
      "customer_id": "cust_visegrad_industrial",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3,
      "total_hours": null
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards",
      "project_name": "Workshop coating standards and training",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4,
      "total_hours": null
    }
  ],
  "total_allocated_time_slice": 0.9,
  "workload_computable": true
}

### Final Result
Camilla Marchetti (employee ID: FphR_013) is currently allocated across 3 projects:

1. High-temperature coating for presses (customer: Machina Press) – Role: Engineer, 0.2 FTE
2. Multi-substrate coating portfolio (customer: Visegrad Industrial) – Role: Engineer, 0.3 FTE
3. Workshop coating standards and training (customer: Balkanmetal Fabrication) – Role: Lead, 0.4 FTE

This results in a total planned workload of 0.9 FTE (90% of a full-time equivalent) across all projects where she is an active team member (including projects of any status, as there is no official definition for 'current projects').

No further action or replanning is needed; this is the definitive answer based on the available data and company policy.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links
