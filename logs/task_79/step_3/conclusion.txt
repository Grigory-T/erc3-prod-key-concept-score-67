I have thoroughly executed Step 3 according to the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: First tried exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla' → No employee found (0 matches)
2. **Partial matching**: Relaxed search by lowercasing and checking for both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in the name → Found 1 employee: "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013)
3. **Fuzzy string comparison**: Used fuzzy matching to handle different ordering:
   - For target "Marchetti Camilla": Top match was "Margherita Gallo" (ratio 0.606), then "Fabio Marchetti" (0.562), then "Camilla Marchetti" (0.529)
   - For target "Camilla Marchetti" (reversed order): Perfect match "Camilla Marchetti" (ratio 1.0), with next best "Fabio Marchetti" (ratio 0.75)
4. **Ambiguity assessment**: The ratio difference between the best candidate (1.0) and next best (0.75) is 0.25, which exceeds the 0.15 threshold → Not ambiguous
5. **Candidate count**: Only one employee contains both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in their name
6. **Verification**: Retrieved full employee details for FphR_013 to confirm identity

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- `list_all_employees()` returned 154 employees
- `search_employees(query="marchetti")` returned 3 employees including FphR_013
- `search_employees(query="camilla")` returned only FphR_013  
- `get_employee("FphR_013")` confirmed details: Camilla Marchetti, HQ – Italy, Sales & Customer Success
- `fuzzy_compare()` provided exact ratios for matching

No state-changing functions were called. The target name "Marchetti Camilla" appears to be in surname-first format, while the system stores names in first-last format as "Camilla Marchetti".

{
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "candidate_count": 1,
  "employee_id": "FphR_013",
  "employee_name": "Camilla Marchetti"
}
