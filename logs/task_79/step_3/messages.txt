## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-03
Current actor: Authenticated user FphR_001
User details: {"id": "FphR_001", "name": "Nino Valente", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:**  What is workload of Marchetti Camilla across current projects?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for the company-specific definitions of the terms "workload" and "current projects" as they relate to employees and projects, to understand exactly what should be calculated for the workload of an employee across projects.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file records and any available internal documentation search tools with queries such as "workload definition", "employee workload", "current projects", "project workload". Account for typos, pluralization, and variations (for example, "work load", "current proj."). Prefer exact matches in titles and headings first, then contents. If multiple relevant definitions are found, select the one most specifically related to employee allocation across projects. If no explicit definition is found, note that and default later to using the most logical technical representation of workload (for example, team_member.time_slice) while clearly documenting this assumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"workload_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["definition_found","workload_definition_text","current_projects_definition_text"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 1 by conducting an extensive search of the company wiki and documentation for definitions of "workload" and "current projects". 

**Search Methodology:**
1. Listed all 19 wiki files available in the system
2. Performed fuzzy searches using terms like "workload", "work load", "employee workload", "current projects", "active projects", etc.
3. Conducted regex searches for definition patterns (e.g., "workload is defined", "current projects are")
4. Examined relevant files directly, including systems/project_registry.md, systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md, hr/people_and_roles.md, and systems/overview.md
5. Performed an exhaustive search across all wiki files for any occurrence of "current" and "project" together
6. Looked for glossary or terminology files that might contain definitions
7. Re-examined fuzzy search results with more specific terms

**Results:**
- **Workload Definition:** Found a clear, explicit definition in `systems/project_registry.md` that defines employee workload as "their allocated FTE slices across all active projects" with detailed explanation of the Workload entries (Employee, TimeSlice, Role).
- **Current Projects Definition:** Despite exhaustive searching through all available documentation, no explicit definition of "current projects" was found. The search revealed 4 lines containing both "current" and "project" across wiki files, but none provided a formal definition. No glossary or terminology files exist in the system, and no status section defining project states was found in the project registry documentation.

All facts are verified from actual function returns - no data was invented or assumed. The workload definition text comes directly from the loaded wiki content, and the absence of a current projects definition is confirmed by multiple search methods returning no definitional content.

Since no explicit definition was found for "current projects," for subsequent steps I will default to the most logical technical representation based on the workload definition's reference to "active projects."

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "workload_definition_text": "## Workload\n\nEmployee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:\n\n* `Employee` – the employee ID\n* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)\n\nThese allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.",
  "current_projects_definition_text": null
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify which technical data structures or services in the available systems represent an employee's workload and project participation, to know exactly where and how to retrieve workload data.
Approach: Inspect the known SQL schema and, if available, any service or API catalog using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for relevant entities and fields such as "team_member", "time_slice", "workload", "capacity", "allocation". Pay particular attention to the team_member table (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice) and the time_entry table to see which is used by internal guidelines (from Step 1) for workload reporting. Confirm whether workload across current projects should be derived from team_member.time_slice (fraction of full-time per project) and whether any additional constraints (such as project status) are part of the technical definition. If no appropriate field or service is found that can express workload, record that the required functionality is not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string","enum":["team_member_time_slice","time_entry_hours","unknown"]},"primary_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supports_project_status_filtering":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["workload_source_type","primary_tables","workload_fields","supports_project_status_filtering"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed. Here is my verification:

**Actions Performed:**
1. **Examined Data Structures**: Retrieved sample project and examined its structure, confirming `TeamMember` objects with `time_slice`, `employee`, and `role` fields.
2. **Checked Time Entry Structure**: Attempted to retrieve time entries (none found in the system).
3. **Tested Search Functions**: Verified `search_projects()` supports filtering by `status` (as a list) and `team_employee`.
4. **Tested Status Filtering**: Confirmed all project statuses ("idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived") are filterable.
5. **Checked Combined Filtering**: Tested filtering by both `status=["active"]` and `team_employee` simultaneously.
6. **Examined Employee Structure**: Retrieved employee data and confirmed no workload fields exist directly on employee records.
7. **Searched Documentation**: Used `search_wiki()` to look for technical schema references (found limited results).
8. **Checked Time Summary Functions**: Tested `time_summary_by_employee()` function to understand available reporting capabilities.

**All Facts Verified (No Assumptions):**
- **TeamMember.time_slice**: Verified from actual project data: `TeamMember(employee='FphR_046', time_slice=0.5, role='Lead')`
- **Project.status filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], limit=2)` which returned active projects
- **team_employee filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 2 projects
- **Combined filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 1 active project
- **All status values**: Verified each status returns projects: "idea" (1), "exploring" (1), "active" (2), "paused" (1), "archived" (0)
- **Time entries**: Verified no time entries exist in system (search returned empty)
- **Employee structure**: Verified from `get_employee("FphR_046")` that employee records contain skills/wills but no workload fields

**No State-Changing Functions Called**: I only used read/search functions, no update functions were called.

**Conclusion**: The technical representation of employee workload is confirmed to be `team_member.time_slice` in project team definitions, with project status filtering fully supported via the `search_projects()` API.

{
  "workload_source_type": "team_member_time_slice",
  "primary_tables": ["project", "team_member"],
  "workload_fields": ["time_slice", "status"],
  "supports_project_status_filtering": true
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Locate the exact employee record corresponding to "Marchetti Camilla" in the employee table to obtain a stable employee_id for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using a combination of exact and FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field, and if needed on id and email fields. First try exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla'. If no record is found, relax the search by lowercasing and trimming whitespace and checking whether 'marchetti' and 'camilla' are contained in the name, then use fuzzy string comparison (for example, Levenshtein distance) to handle typos or different order (such as 'Camilla Marchetti'). If multiple candidates are returned, rank them by fuzzy similarity score and select the top candidate only if its similarity score is clearly higher than others (for example, by a defined margin); otherwise, mark the result as ambiguous and require clarification. Capture whether a unique employee was found and, if so, the corresponding employee_id and canonical name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidate_count","employee_id","employee_name"]}

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 3 to locate the employee record for "Marchetti Camilla". Based on my search of the employee database, I found a unique match for this employee.

**Search Methodology:**
1. **Exact match search**: No employee found with exact name "Marchetti Camilla" (case-insensitive)
2. **Partial match search**: Found 1 employee containing both "marchetti" and "camilla" in their name: "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013)
3. **Fuzzy matching**: The candidate "Camilla Marchetti" has a perfect match ratio of 1.0 for the reversed name "Camilla Marchetti" and a ratio of 0.529 for the original "Marchetti Camilla"
4. **Database searches**: 
   - Search for "marchetti" returned 3 employees: Camilla Marchetti, Fabio Marchetti, Antonio Marchetti
   - Search for "camilla" returned 1 employee: Camilla Marchetti
5. **Ambiguity analysis**: The ratio difference between the top candidate (1.0) and next best (0.75) is 0.25, which exceeds the 0.15 threshold, indicating a clear unique match

**Conclusion**: The employee "Marchetti Camilla" appears to have been specified with surname-first order, while the system stores names in "First Last" format. The employee "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013) is the unambiguous match.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Locate the exact employee record corresponding to "Marchetti Camilla" in the employee table to obtain a stable employee_id for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using a combination of exact and FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field, and if needed on id and email fields. First try exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla'. If no record is found, relax the search by lowercasing and trimming whitespace and checking whether 'marchetti' and 'camilla' are contained in the name, then use fuzzy string comparison (for example, Levenshtein distance) to handle typos or different order (such as 'Camilla Marchetti'). If multiple candidates are returned, rank them by fuzzy similarity score and select the top candidate only if its similarity score is clearly higher than others (for example, by a defined margin); otherwise, mark the result as ambiguous and require clarification. Capture whether a unique employee was found and, if so, the corresponding employee_id and canonical name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidate_count","employee_id","employee_name"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have thoroughly executed Step 3 according to the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: First tried exact match on name = 'Marchetti Camilla' → No employee found (0 matches)
2. **Partial matching**: Relaxed search by lowercasing and checking for both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in the name → Found 1 employee: "Camilla Marchetti" (ID: FphR_013)
3. **Fuzzy string comparison**: Used fuzzy matching to handle different ordering:
   - For target "Marchetti Camilla": Top match was "Margherita Gallo" (ratio 0.606), then "Fabio Marchetti" (0.562), then "Camilla Marchetti" (0.529)
   - For target "Camilla Marchetti" (reversed order): Perfect match "Camilla Marchetti" (ratio 1.0), with next best "Fabio Marchetti" (ratio 0.75)
4. **Ambiguity assessment**: The ratio difference between the best candidate (1.0) and next best (0.75) is 0.25, which exceeds the 0.15 threshold → Not ambiguous
5. **Candidate count**: Only one employee contains both 'marchetti' and 'camilla' in their name
6. **Verification**: Retrieved full employee details for FphR_013 to confirm identity

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- `list_all_employees()` returned 154 employees
- `search_employees(query="marchetti")` returned 3 employees including FphR_013
- `search_employees(query="camilla")` returned only FphR_013  
- `get_employee("FphR_013")` confirmed details: Camilla Marchetti, HQ – Italy, Sales & Customer Success
- `fuzzy_compare()` provided exact ratios for matching

No state-changing functions were called. The target name "Marchetti Camilla" appears to be in surname-first format, while the system stores names in first-last format as "Camilla Marchetti".
