We are in Step 1. We need to search the internal wiki and documentation for definitions of "workload" and "current projects".
 We'll use the available functions to search the wiki.
 Steps:
 1. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` to search for the words ["workload", "work load", "employee workload", "current projects", "project workload"]
 2. Also try a regex search with `search_wiki` for patterns that might be in headings.
 3. We'll look for definitions in the results.

 Since the task says to use fuzzy and semantic/logical search, we'll use `search_wiki_fuzzy` and also try `search_wiki` with a regex that matches headings (like "# Definition" or "Workload:").

 However, note that `search_wiki_fuzzy` allows us to search for multiple words and returns context.

 Let's start by getting a list of wiki files to see what we have, then perform fuzzy searches.

 But note: we have a function `search_wiki_fuzzy` that takes a list of words and returns matches.

 We are allowed to execute Python code. Let's do it step by step.

 Important: We must print intermediate results.

 We are acting on behalf of the user FphR_001.

 Let's get the current context first to confirm user and date.

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 23:20:55
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to search for definitions of "workload" and "current projects" in the wiki.
 We have list of files. We can load each file and search for relevant terms, but we have fuzzy search functions.
 Let's use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of target words.

 Steps:
 1. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with words: ["workload", "work load", "employee workload", "project workload"]
 2. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with words: ["current projects", "current proj", "active projects"]
 3. Also, we can search by regex in the wiki content for exact phrases, but fuzzy should cover.

 However, note: search_wiki_fuzzy returns matches per word, not per phrase. We might need to search for phrases by regex or by loading files and searching.

 Alternatively, we can use the regex search function: search_wiki(query_regex) which returns lines matching the regex.

 Let's try both: first fuzzy for single words, then regex for phrases.

 We are looking for definitions, so we might want to look for sections that define these terms.

 Approach:
  - We'll search for the words in the wiki and then examine the context.

 But note: the step says "Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search". We have fuzzy functions, and we can also load files and look for headings.

 Let's start with fuzzy search for the word "workload" and "current" and "projects".

 We'll do:

   results_workload = search_wiki_fuzzy(["workload", "work load"], top_n=20, context_chars=200)
   results_current = search_wiki_fuzzy(["current projects", "current proj", "active projects"], top_n=20, context_chars=200)

 However, note: search_wiki_fuzzy takes a list of words and does fuzzy matching on each word. It might not handle phrases well.

 Alternatively, we can use regex to search for the phrase "workload" and "current projects".

 Let's use the regex search:

   search_wiki(query_regex) -> looks for regex in the wiki files.

 We'll search for:
   - "workload"
   - "current projects"

 But note: the step says to account for typos and variations, so fuzzy is good.

 We'll combine: first, fuzzy search for the words, then we can also do regex for exact phrases.

 Let's do:

  1. Fuzzy search for workload and current projects words.
  2. Then, we can also manually look in files that are likely to have definitions (like hr/people_and_roles.md, systems/project_registry.md, systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md).

 Since we are to find definitions, we can also look for headings that contain "workload" or "current projects".

 We'll write code to:

   a. Use fuzzy search to get potential matches.
   b. Use regex search to get exact matches.

 Then, we'll examine the results and try to find a definition.

 However, note: we are to return the definition text if found.

 We might need to load the entire file and look for a section that defines the term.

 Let's break down:

  We'll search for the term "workload" in the wiki using regex and fuzzy.

  Then, we'll search for "current projects" in the wiki.

  We'll then look for lines that contain the word "definition" or are in a section that seems to define the term.

  But note: the wiki might not have explicit definitions.

  We are to return:
      definition_found: boolean
      workload_definition_text: string or null
      current_projects_definition_text: string or null

  We'll set:
      definition_found = True if we find at least one definition for either term.

  We'll try to extract the definition text from the context.

  However, the fuzzy search returns context. We can look at the context and see if it looks like a definition.

  Alternatively, we can load the files that are most relevant and look for definitions.

  Let's first try fuzzy search.

  We'll do:

      workload_matches = search_wiki_fuzzy(["workload", "work load"], top_n=10, context_chars=200)
      current_proj_matches = search_wiki_fuzzy(["current projects", "current proj", "active projects"], top_n=10, context_chars=200)

  Then, we can also use regex to search for the exact string "workload" and "current projects".

  We'll do:

      regex_workload = search_wiki("workload")
      regex_current = search_wiki("current projects")

  Then, we can combine and analyze.

  We'll write a function to look for definitions in the matches. We'll look for lines that contain the word "definition" or "means" or "refer to", or we can look for the first sentence that contains the term.

  However, note: we are to return the definition text. We might not have a perfect way to extract the definition automatically.

  We can try to find the section that contains the term and then take a few lines before and after.

  Alternatively, we can look for a pattern like: "Workload is defined as ..." or "The term 'workload' refers to ...".

  We'll do:

      For each match from fuzzy or regex, we can look at the line and see if it contains a definition pattern.

  But note: the fuzzy search returns a context of 200 characters. We can use that.

  We'll collect all matches and then manually inspect (in code) to see if any look like a definition.

  We can also look for the word "define" in the context.

  Let's proceed.

  We'll do:

     1. Fuzzy and regex search.
     2. Combine results.
     3. For each result, check if the context contains the word "define" or "definition" or "means" or "refer to".
     4. If found, we'll take that as a definition text.

  If we don't find such a pattern, we'll take the best match (highest ratio) and use its context as the definition, but note it might not be a definition.

  We are to return the definition text if found, else null.

  We'll do for both terms.

  Steps:

      search for workload:
          - fuzzy search with words: ["workload", "work load"]
          - regex search for "workload"

      search for current projects:
          - fuzzy search with words: ["current projects", "current proj", "active projects"]
          - regex search for "current projects"

  Then, we'll process the results.

  Let's code accordingly.

  We'll write a helper function to extract definition text from matches.

  We'll consider a match as a definition if the context contains any of the definition keywords.

  If multiple, we'll take the first one that matches.

  If none, then we'll return null for that term.

  We'll set definition_found to True if we have at least one definition (for either term).

  Let's code.

We need to look more carefully at the content. The fuzzy search returned many results but we filtered for ratio > 70 and got none? Actually the print statements for high quality matches didn't show anything because the ratio threshold might be too high. Let me adjust the approach.

We saw one relevant content in systems/project_registry.md. Let's load that file entirely and examine it for definitions.

Also, note that the fuzzy search returns many results but we didn't print them because of the ratio filter. Let's lower the threshold or examine the raw results.

But first, let's directly load the systems/project_registry.md file and look for definitions of workload and current projects.

Also, we should check the systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md file.

Let me write a more targeted search:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #4] 2025-12-09 23:22:56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found a definition for workload but not for current projects. We need to search more specifically for current projects definition.
 Let's check the project registry for status definitions or any mention of "active projects" as that seems to be the term used in the workload definition.
 We'll also check other files for status definitions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #5] 2025-12-09 23:24:02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are asked to verify that we have completed Step 1 correctly and to check if we missed anything.

We executed the step by:
1. Listing all wiki files.
2. Using fuzzy search for workload and current projects terms.
3. Examining relevant files (especially project_registry.md) and extracting a definition for workload.
4. We did not find an explicit definition for "current projects".

However, note that in the verification checklist, it says:
- "If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc."
- "Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation."

We did use fuzzy search and found many matches, but we did not examine every single fuzzy match in detail. We focused on the most promising files.

But let's double-check: the fuzzy search for workload and current projects returned many results (160 and 120). We only looked at those with ratio > 70 and then examined the top files. We might have missed some relevant information in lower ratio matches.

Also, we did not use the `search_wiki` function with regex patterns for "current projects" in a more exhaustive way. We tried a few patterns but not all possible variations.

Let me do a more exhaustive search for "current projects" by:
1. Using regex to search for "current project" and "active project" in all files.
2. Also, check the project status definitions in the project registry more thoroughly.

But note: we already examined the project_registry.md file and didn't find an explicit definition for current projects. However, we did see that the workload definition mentions "active projects". So it's possible that "current projects" is synonymous with "active projects". 

We should also check if there is a definition of project statuses (like active, exploring, paused, archived) in the project registry. We saw a status section but didn't find it in our previous examination. Let me check again.

We'll run a more targeted search for project status definitions and then for "current" in the context of projects.

We'll also check the fuzzy search results for current projects in more detail.

But note: we must be careful not to change state. We are only reading.

Let me write additional code to double-check:

The user has asked for verification of the step execution. I need to ensure that I have completed the step thoroughly and that all facts are verified from function returns. Let me review:

Step 1: Search internal wiki for definitions of "workload" and "current projects". I performed multiple searches: fuzzy search, regex search, direct file examination. I found a clear definition for "workload" in systems/project_registry.md. For "current projects", despite exhaustive search including fuzzy matching, checking all wiki files, looking for glossary, etc., no explicit definition was found. I documented this in the final answer.

The JSON output must contain only values explicitly printed/verified. The workload definition text was printed in full from the project_registry.md file. The current_projects_definition_text is null because no definition was found.

I should double-check if there are any other wiki files that might contain definitions. The list of wiki files is fixed (19 files). I have examined all of them? Let me quickly check if I missed any file that might contain definitions. I examined project_registry.md, time_tracking_and_reporting.md, overview.md, HR files. But there might be other files like systems/crm.md or business/* files. However, the term "current projects" is likely in project context, so project_registry.md is the most relevant. I also searched all files for lines containing both "current" and "project" and found 4 lines, but none were definitional.

Thus, I am confident that the search was thorough.

Now, for the final answer: I need to repeat both <final_answer> and <json> blocks. The JSON should be exactly as before, since no new definition was found.

I will now provide the final answer.
