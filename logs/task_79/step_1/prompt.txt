Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for the company-specific definitions of the terms "workload" and "current projects" as they relate to employees and projects, to understand exactly what should be calculated for the workload of an employee across projects.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file records and any available internal documentation search tools with queries such as "workload definition", "employee workload", "current projects", "project workload". Account for typos, pluralization, and variations (for example, "work load", "current proj."). Prefer exact matches in titles and headings first, then contents. If multiple relevant definitions are found, select the one most specifically related to employee allocation across projects. If no explicit definition is found, note that and default later to using the most logical technical representation of workload (for example, team_member.time_slice) while clearly documenting this assumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"workload_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["definition_found","workload_definition_text","current_projects_definition_text"]}
