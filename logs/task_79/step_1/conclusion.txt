I have thoroughly executed Step 1 by conducting an extensive search of the company wiki and documentation for definitions of "workload" and "current projects". 

**Search Methodology:**
1. Listed all 19 wiki files available in the system
2. Performed fuzzy searches using terms like "workload", "work load", "employee workload", "current projects", "active projects", etc.
3. Conducted regex searches for definition patterns (e.g., "workload is defined", "current projects are")
4. Examined relevant files directly, including systems/project_registry.md, systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md, hr/people_and_roles.md, and systems/overview.md
5. Performed an exhaustive search across all wiki files for any occurrence of "current" and "project" together
6. Looked for glossary or terminology files that might contain definitions
7. Re-examined fuzzy search results with more specific terms

**Results:**
- **Workload Definition:** Found a clear, explicit definition in `systems/project_registry.md` that defines employee workload as "their allocated FTE slices across all active projects" with detailed explanation of the Workload entries (Employee, TimeSlice, Role).
- **Current Projects Definition:** Despite exhaustive searching through all available documentation, no explicit definition of "current projects" was found. The search revealed 4 lines containing both "current" and "project" across wiki files, but none provided a formal definition. No glossary or terminology files exist in the system, and no status section defining project states was found in the project registry documentation.

All facts are verified from actual function returns - no data was invented or assumed. The workload definition text comes directly from the loaded wiki content, and the absence of a current projects definition is confirmed by multiple search methods returning no definitional content.

Since no explicit definition was found for "current projects," for subsequent steps I will default to the most logical technical representation based on the workload definition's reference to "active projects."
