DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:25:56
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was successfully executed and returned valid results per the original plan. A clear workload definition was found, and while an explicit definition for 'current projects' was not found, the plan already anticipated defaulting to the logical technical representation (active projects) if the definition was missing. There are no discrepancies, missing functions, or obstacles preventing progress to Step 2. The next step will clarify the technical structures for calculating workload. Therefore, the plan remains valid and it is appropriate to continue.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:31:38
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The current plan has completed Steps 1 and 2 successfully and in full compliance with the original instructions. Both steps produced clear expected results without anomalies or policy conflicts. There were no unexpected results, missing functionalities, or inconsistencies that would require replanning. The next step is Step 3, which is directly actionable and has not yet been performed. Therefore, the logical next action is to continue to Step 3 as outlined in the original plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:36:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Each of the first three steps in the plan have been completed successfully and their results are as expected: a clear source of workload data (team_member.time_slice), the precise employee ('Camilla Marchetti', FphR_013) is uniquely identified, and all definitions have been confirmed with no discrepancies or missing functionality so far. The only minor gap is the lack of a formal definition for 'current projects', but the documentation aligns this to 'active projects' and this has been handled explicitly and transparently. There are no unexpected results, errors, or technical gaps that would force a replan or abort at this stage. Therefore, the plan remains valid and it is correct to proceed to the next step (Step 4: permissions check).

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:40:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced expected and relevant results according to the plan. Explicit definitions and technical representations of workload have been established; the target employee is uniquely identified; and user permissions are confirmed valid with no policy violations. There are no discrepancies or missing data that preclude completing the task. Step 5 needs to be executed to actually aggregate and present the current workload data for Camilla Marchetti across all current ('active') projects as defined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:44:26
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed successfully, and each step produced the expected results with verifiable outputs. Step 5 provides the definitive answer as intended: Camilla Marchetti is allocated to 3 projects (2 active, 1 exploring), with a total workload of 0.9 FTE. There are no missing prerequisites for the final answer, and Step 6 is not necessary because no abort scenario has been triggered. Thus, the task is complete and the final answer should be presented.
