Step 2: Identify which technical data structures or services in the available systems represent an employee's workload and project participation, to know exactly where and how to retrieve workload data.
Approach: Inspect the known SQL schema and, if available, any service or API catalog using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for relevant entities and fields such as "team_member", "time_slice", "workload", "capacity", "allocation". Pay particular attention to the team_member table (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice) and the time_entry table to see which is used by internal guidelines (from Step 1) for workload reporting. Confirm whether workload across current projects should be derived from team_member.time_slice (fraction of full-time per project) and whether any additional constraints (such as project status) are part of the technical definition. If no appropriate field or service is found that can express workload, record that the required functionality is not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string","enum":["team_member_time_slice","time_entry_hours","unknown"]},"primary_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supports_project_status_filtering":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["workload_source_type","primary_tables","workload_fields","supports_project_status_filtering"]}
