I have executed Step 2 as instructed. Here is my verification:

**Actions Performed:**
1. **Examined Data Structures**: Retrieved sample project and examined its structure, confirming `TeamMember` objects with `time_slice`, `employee`, and `role` fields.
2. **Checked Time Entry Structure**: Attempted to retrieve time entries (none found in the system).
3. **Tested Search Functions**: Verified `search_projects()` supports filtering by `status` (as a list) and `team_employee`.
4. **Tested Status Filtering**: Confirmed all project statuses ("idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived") are filterable.
5. **Checked Combined Filtering**: Tested filtering by both `status=["active"]` and `team_employee` simultaneously.
6. **Examined Employee Structure**: Retrieved employee data and confirmed no workload fields exist directly on employee records.
7. **Searched Documentation**: Used `search_wiki()` to look for technical schema references (found limited results).
8. **Checked Time Summary Functions**: Tested `time_summary_by_employee()` function to understand available reporting capabilities.

**All Facts Verified (No Assumptions):**
- **TeamMember.time_slice**: Verified from actual project data: `TeamMember(employee='FphR_046', time_slice=0.5, role='Lead')`
- **Project.status filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], limit=2)` which returned active projects
- **team_employee filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 2 projects
- **Combined filtering**: Verified by calling `search_projects(status=["active"], team_employee="FphR_046")` which returned 1 active project
- **All status values**: Verified each status returns projects: "idea" (1), "exploring" (1), "active" (2), "paused" (1), "archived" (0)
- **Time entries**: Verified no time entries exist in system (search returned empty)
- **Employee structure**: Verified from `get_employee("FphR_046")` that employee records contain skills/wills but no workload fields

**No State-Changing Functions Called**: I only used read/search functions, no update functions were called.

**Conclusion**: The technical representation of employee workload is confirmed to be `team_member.time_slice` in project team definitions, with project status filtering fully supported via the `search_projects()` API.
