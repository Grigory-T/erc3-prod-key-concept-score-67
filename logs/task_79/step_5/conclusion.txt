STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

I have now correctly executed Step 5 following the exact instructions. Here's what I did:

**Correction to Initial Approach:**
In my initial execution, I incorrectly filtered to only "active" projects based on the workload definition mentioning "active projects". However, the step instructions explicitly state: "If the documentation from Step 1 defines 'current projects' in terms of project.status... apply that filter; otherwise, include all projects where the employee is a team member, without introducing additional status checks."

Since Step 1 did NOT find an explicit definition of "current projects" (only workload definition mentioned "active projects"), I should NOT apply status filters. I corrected this by searching for ALL projects where FphR_013 is a team member, regardless of status.

**Corrected Methodology:**
1. Searched for ALL projects (any status, including archived) where FphR_013 is a team member
2. Found 3 projects total (2 active, 1 exploring)
3. Retrieved detailed project information for each, including role and time slice (FTE)
4. Calculated total allocated time slice as the sum of FTE across all 3 projects

**Results:**
- Employee Camilla Marchetti (FphR_013) is allocated to 3 projects across different statuses
- Total allocated time slice: 0.9 FTE (90% of full-time equivalent)
- Projects include:
  - 2 active projects (0.2 + 0.4 FTE)
  - 1 exploring project (0.3 FTE)

No state-changing functions were called during this step. All facts were verified from function returns.
