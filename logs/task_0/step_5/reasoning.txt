We are at Step 5. We need to retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames".

 From Step 3, we have a list of candidate projects with match scores. The top match (with score 2.191) is:
   project_id: "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer"
   project_name: "High-build machinery primer optimisation"
   customer_name: "RhineMach Industrial GROUP"

 This is clearly the best match. We will use this project.

 Approach:
  1. Get the project details (including team) for project_id "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer".
  2. From the team, filter for members with role == 'Lead'.
  3. For each lead, get their employee details (id, name, email) by calling get_employee.
  4. If no leads are found, set found=False and notes accordingly.

 We must ensure we have read access (Step 4 already confirmed we can view).

 Let's execute.

We are done with Step 5. We have retrieved the project lead for the best-matching project.
 The output shows one lead: Alessia De Luca (employee ID BwFV_050).
 Now, we must format the final answer as specified in the expected output.

 Expected Output: 
 {
   "type": "object", 
   "properties": {
     "project_id": {"type": "string"}, 
     "leads": {
       "type": "array", 
       "items": {
         "type": "object", 
         "properties": {
           "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, 
           "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, 
           "employee_email": {"type": "string"}
         }, 
         "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name"]
       }
     }, 
     "found": {"type": "boolean"}, 
     "notes": {"type": "string"}
   }, 
   "required": ["found"]
 }

 We have all the required information.

 Let's prepare the JSON response accordingly.

We are verifying the execution of Step 5.

 We have already executed the step and obtained a result. Let's check if we followed the instructions correctly:

 1. We selected the best-matching project from Step 3. The best match was determined by the highest match score (2.191) and clear association with the "RhineMach" customer.
    - We used the project ID: "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer".

 2. We queried the project's team members and filtered by role 'Lead'. We found one lead.

 3. We joined with the employee table (via get_employee) to get the lead's employee_id, full name, and email.

 4. We captured the outcome in the required JSON format.

 We used the following functions and verified the data by printing:
   - who_am_i() to confirm the user (but this was not required for the step, only for context)
   - get_project(project_id) to get the project details and team.
   - get_employee(employee_id) for each lead to get the employee details.

 All data in the JSON response was explicitly printed and verified from function returns.

 We did not use any made-up data or sensible defaults.

 We did not perform any state-changing operations (only read operations).

 We did not need to use fuzzy matching in this step because we were working with known IDs from the previous step.

 The step instruction did not require us to handle the case where the project is not found or no lead exists, but we did check and captured the outcome.

 Let's double-check the project selection logic:

 In Step 3, we had 10 candidate projects. The top project had a match score of 2.191 and was linked to the RhineMach customer. The next highest score was 0.794, which is significantly lower.

 Therefore, the selection of the best-matching project is sound.

 We provided the required JSON with the project_id, leads (array of objects with employee_id, employee_name, employee_email), found (boolean), and notes (string).

 We are confident that we have executed the step as instructed.

 We will now repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
