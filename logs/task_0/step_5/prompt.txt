Step 5: Retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames", assuming read access is permitted.
Approach: From the candidate projects identified in step 3, select the best-matching project according to the computed match scores and any clear association with the "RhineMach" customer, ensuring that the selection logic accounts for potential naming ambiguities but favors the highest-confidence match. Then, query the team_member table filtered by this project_id and role = 'Lead'. Join the resulting team_member records with the employee table to obtain each lead's employee_id, full name, and email. If no project matches were found, or no team_member with role 'Lead' exists, capture that outcome explicitly instead of fabricating data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "leads": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found"]}
