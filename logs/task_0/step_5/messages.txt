## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-08
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_104
User details: {"id": "BwFV_104", "name": "Lazar Petrovski", "department": "Production \u2013 Serbia", "location": "Serbian Plant"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who's lead on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames" to understand the exact internal naming or identifiers of this project (treat all terms as potentially ambiguous; the search MUST be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL and account for typos, misspellings, partial matches, and abbreviations).
Approach: Query the wiki_file table using a combination of exact, partial, and fuzzy matching on the content and path fields for keywords and variants such as "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "RhineMach", "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and "machinery frames". Apply a SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search layer (for example, considering that "primer" relates to coatings, paint, surface preparation, etc.) and FUZZY matching to handle spelling variations and spacing. Collect any project names, internal project identifiers (e.g., proj_*), and customer names that appear in context with these terms. Do not take any further action in this step beyond aggregating these references.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"found_references": {"type": "boolean"}, "related_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "related_customers": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found_references"]}
**Result:** I have completed a thorough re-examination of the wiki for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames". After exhaustive fuzzy, semantic, and logical searching across all 19 wiki files:

1. **Found References**: True - The wiki contains general references to "primer" in anti-corrosion systems (mentioned in company/overview.md) and "machinery" as a primary market segment (mentioned in business/markets_and_customers.md). The fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms.

2. **Related Projects**: No specific project identifiers (proj_*) were found anywhere in the wiki content. The project registry file only contains documentation about project structure but no actual project IDs.

3. **Related Customers**: No mention of "RhineMach" or any variant was found in any wiki file. The capitalized words found in fuzzy results (Switzerland, Industrial, Production, etc.) are not customer names related to the search terms.

4. **Notes**: The wiki contains general information about Bellini's business including primer as part of anti-corrosion systems and machinery as a market segment, but no specific documentation for a "primer optimisation" project for "RhineMach machinery frames" exists in the wiki. No project IDs or customer names matching the search criteria were found despite extensive fuzzy, regex, and semantic searching.

I executed the complete step with multiple search strategies: fuzzy matching across all terms, regex pattern matching for specific strings, semantic expansion to related terms (coatings, paint, surface preparation), examination of all 19 wiki files, and re-examination of results for hidden references. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "found_references": true,
  "related_projects": [],
  "related_customers": [],
  "notes": "The wiki contains general references to 'primer' (in anti-corrosion systems) and 'machinery' (as a market segment), but no specific project identifiers (proj_*) or customer 'RhineMach' were found. Fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms (primer, machinery, coatings, etc.) but none in the context of a specific 'primer optimisation' project for 'RhineMach machinery frames'."
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine which technical data structures (tables and fields) should be used to map the question "Who is lead on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?" to database queries, using the available SQL schema as the authoritative technical implementation reference.
Approach: Inspect the provided SQL table definitions to identify which tables and columns represent projects, customers, and project team roles. Confirm that: the project table holds project identifiers, names, and descriptions; the customer table holds customer identifiers and names that could correspond to "RhineMach"; and the team_member table, joined with employee, holds roles such as 'Lead'. Map the natural language concepts "primer optimisation project", "RhineMach", and "machinery frames" to specific fields (e.g., project.name, project.description, customer.name) that will be used in subsequent searches. This step is conceptual and uses the existing schema; no data rows are retrieved yet.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"relevant_tables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "field_mapping": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_field": {"type": "string"}, "project_description_field": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name_field": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["project_name_field", "project_description_field", "customer_name_field"]}, "confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["relevant_tables", "confirmed"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by inspecting the available data structures (Pydantic models) which serve as the technical implementation reference in this environment. I analyzed the ProjectBrief, ProjectFull, CustomerBrief, CustomerFull, and TeamMember structures to identify relevant tables and fields. The natural language concepts map to specific fields as confirmed by the printed data structures: project name/description fields, customer name field, and team role field. All facts were verified from the function returns without retrieving actual data rows.

{
  "relevant_tables": ["project", "customer", "team_member", "employee"],
  "field_mapping": {
    "project_name_field": "name",
    "project_description_field": "description",
    "customer_name_field": "name"
  },
  "confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the most likely project record(s) corresponding to the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" by searching the project and customer data, treating the textual references as potentially ambiguous and applying FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search with allowances for typos and partial matches.
Approach: First, query the customer table to search for a customer whose name matches or approximately matches "RhineMach" (including variants like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and case-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive comparisons). Use exact match where possible, then relax filters using substring search (lowercased, trimmed), then apply fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar) and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle near matches. Next, query the project table using a combination of project.name and project.description, filtering for terms like "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", and "machinery frames" with the same strategy: exact, partial, then fuzzy and semantic matching. If a likely customer for "RhineMach" is identified, further prioritize or filter projects linked via project.customer_id to that customer. Collect all candidate projects with associated match scores and do not yet assume a single correct project if multiple reasonable matches exist.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "project_description": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "match_score"]}}, "search_notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["projects"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 3 exactly as instructed:

1. **Customer Search**: I queried the customer table using multiple strategies:
   - Exact match (case-insensitive): No exact matches
   - Substring match: Found "RhineMach Industrial GROUP" (ID: cust_rhinemach_industrial)
   - Fuzzy matching: The same customer had a 0.51 ratio for "RhineMach"
   - Semantic/logical: Considered variations like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach"

2. **Project Search**: I queried the project table with comprehensive searching:
   - Retrieved all 36 projects with full details (name, description, customer)
   - Applied exact/partial matching for terms: "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "machinery frames", and related terms
   - Applied fuzzy matching on the full phrase "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" (top result had 0.53 ratio)
   - Prioritized projects linked to the RhineMach customer (found 1 direct link)
   - Collected all candidate projects with calculated match scores

3. **Verification of Facts**: All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns:
   - Project IDs, names, descriptions from `get_project()` calls
   - Customer IDs and names from `get_customer()` calls  
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used
   - All 10 projects were found through actual searches and printed in execution

4. **No State Changes**: I did not call any update functions, only read operations.

The search was thorough, applying fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching as requested. The match scores are calculated based on actual term matches and customer linkages found in the data.

Other projects have lower scores and are less relevant (contain only partial matches like 'primer' or 'machinery' but not the full context). The fuzzy search ratio for the top project was 0.53 for the full phrase search."
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (employee BwFV_104, Lazar Petrovski) to read project and team-lead information for the identified candidate project(s).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity, department (Production – Serbia), location (Serbian Plant), and any system roles. Using this identity and the list of candidate project identifiers from the previous step, evaluate company rules and access policies to determine whether the user is allowed to read basic project metadata and team_member records (including which employee has role 'Lead'). Since no specific restrictions are defined for read access to these tables in the provided rules, confirm that such read access is permitted for this user. Record the decision and reasoning without altering any data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_view": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "user_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["can_view", "user_id"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I confirmed the current user identity via who_am_i(), retrieved and tested access to project data for the top candidate project, evaluated company rules, and determined that the user has permission to read project and team-lead information. All facts were verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated employee; no company rules restrict READ access to project metadata or team_member records; successfully retrieved project and team data including lead role in test.",
  "user_id": "BwFV_104",
  "project_ids": ["proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "proj_it_chatbot_pilot_bellini", "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial"]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames", assuming read access is permitted.
Approach: From the candidate projects identified in step 3, select the best-matching project according to the computed match scores and any clear association with the "RhineMach" customer, ensuring that the selection logic accounts for potential naming ambiguities but favors the highest-confidence match. Then, query the team_member table filtered by this project_id and role = 'Lead'. Join the resulting team_member records with the employee table to obtain each lead's employee_id, full name, and email. If no project matches were found, or no team_member with role 'Lead' exists, capture that outcome explicitly instead of fabricating data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "leads": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found"]}

I have completed Step 5 by retrieving the project lead(s) for the best-matching "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames". The execution successfully identified the project lead for the most relevant project.

<final_answer>
I executed Step 5 to retrieve the project lead(s) for the best-matching "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames". Based on the match scores from Step 3, the project "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" (titled "High-build machinery primer optimisation") was identified as the best match with a score of 2.191. I retrieved the full project details including the team members and filtered for those with the 'Lead' role. One lead was found: Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050). No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations to retrieve project and employee information.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames", assuming read access is permitted.
Approach: From the candidate projects identified in step 3, select the best-matching project according to the computed match scores and any clear association with the "RhineMach" customer, ensuring that the selection logic accounts for potential naming ambiguities but favors the highest-confidence match. Then, query the team_member table filtered by this project_id and role = 'Lead'. Join the resulting team_member records with the employee table to obtain each lead's employee_id, full name, and email. If no project matches were found, or no team_member with role 'Lead' exists, capture that outcome explicitly instead of fabricating data.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have verified my execution of Step 5 against the checklist. Let me address each point:

## Verification:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes, I:
   - Selected the best-matching project from Step 3 (proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer with match score 2.191)
   - Queried the project's team members via `get_project()`
   - Filtered for role='Lead'
   - Joined with employee table via `get_employee()` to get full details
   - Captured the outcome in the required JSON format

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ❌ No, I:
   - Did NOT assume any data - all values came from function returns
   - Did NOT skip any required actions
   - Verified each piece of data by printing it before use

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes, I:
   - Printed the project details: name, status, customer, team size
   - Printed each lead's details: employee_id, name, email
   - All data came from `get_project()` and `get_employee()` returns

4. **JSON contains ONLY verified values** ✅ Yes, all values in the JSON were explicitly printed:
   - `project_id`: From selection logic based on Step 3 results
   - `leads[0].employee_id`: Printed as "Lead employee ID: BwFV_050"
   - `leads[0].employee_name`: Printed as "Name: Alessia De Luca"
   - `leads[0].employee_email`: Printed as "Email: BwFV_050@bellini.internal"
   - `found`: Derived from actual data retrieval
   - `notes`: Created based on actual results

5. **No made-up data or sensible defaults** ✅ All facts derived from function returns:
   - Project details from `get_project("proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer")`
   - Employee details from `get_employee("BwFV_050")`

6. **Search strategies considered** ✅ For this step, no additional searching was needed as we had:
   - Clear best match from Step 3 (score 2.191 vs next 0.794)
   - Exact project ID to retrieve

7. **No state-changing operations** ✅ Only used `get_project()` and `get_employee()` read operations

8. **Semantic/logical matching** ✅ Already applied in Step 3 selection

The execution is complete and correct. All required actions were performed, all data is verified, and no assumptions were made.

<final_answer>
I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the checklist. All requirements were met: I executed the step instruction completely, used no assumptions, verified all facts from function returns, included only explicitly printed values in the JSON, performed no state-changing operations, and applied proper selection logic from Step 3 results. The project lead for the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050).
