================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 19:33:12

I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the checklist. All requirements were met: I executed the step instruction completely, used no assumptions, verified all facts from function returns, included only explicitly printed values in the JSON, performed no state-changing operations, and applied proper selection logic from Step 3 results. The project lead for the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050).
