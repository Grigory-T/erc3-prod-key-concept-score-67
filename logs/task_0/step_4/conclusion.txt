I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I confirmed the current user identity via who_am_i(), retrieved and tested access to project data for the top candidate project, evaluated company rules, and determined that the user has permission to read project and team-lead information. All facts were verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated employee; no company rules restrict READ access to project metadata or team_member records; successfully retrieved project and team data including lead role in test.",
  "user_id": "BwFV_104",
  "project_ids": ["proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "proj_it_chatbot_pilot_bellini", "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial"]
}
