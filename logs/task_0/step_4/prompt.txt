Step 4: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (employee BwFV_104, Lazar Petrovski) to read project and team-lead information for the identified candidate project(s).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity, department (Production – Serbia), location (Serbian Plant), and any system roles. Using this identity and the list of candidate project identifiers from the previous step, evaluate company rules and access policies to determine whether the user is allowed to read basic project metadata and team_member records (including which employee has role 'Lead'). Since no specific restrictions are defined for read access to these tables in the provided rules, confirm that such read access is permitted for this user. Record the decision and reasoning without altering any data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_view": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "user_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["can_view", "user_id"]}
