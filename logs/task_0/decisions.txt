DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:20:11
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The result of Step 1 shows that the wiki contains only general references to 'primer' and 'machinery', but no specific project identifiers or relevant customer names ('RhineMach') were found. However, the plan does not rely on the wiki data alone—its next steps involve inspecting the technical schema, then searching structured project/customer data using flexible and fuzzy approaches. Since the lack of specific data in the wiki does not preclude finding relevant projects/customers using the structured data, the plan is still valid and can continue as originally designed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:22:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both steps 1 and 2 executed fully according to the original plan and provided the required outputs. Wiki searches (step 1) revealed no specific project or customer for the query, but did not preclude that such information could exist in CRM/project registries. Step 2 confirmed the relevant database structures for continuing. No unexpected issues or missing information have appeared. The step outputs align with task goals and match expectations set by the plan. Steps 3-6 can still be executed as planned, so replanning is not required.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:29:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced results fully aligned with the original plan, and all outputs are as expected. The candidate project matching the search criteria has been clearly identified (proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer), and no unexpected issues, missing data, or errors have occurred. The next step (permission check and lead retrieval) can and should be performed exactly as planned, as there is no evidence requiring a replan. It is appropriate to continue with the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:31:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have provided expected and relevant results as per the Original Plan. Step 4 confirmed that the user has permission to proceed, and the project most closely matching the request has been unambiguously identified. No inconsistencies or missing data were detected that would require replanning. The plan is still valid, and the next step (retrieving the project lead(s) for the identified project) can move forward as designed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:33:23
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have produced the expected results without issues or ambiguities. The project relevant to 'primer optimisation for RhineMach machinery frames' was unambiguously identified, permissions were confirmed, and the project lead (Alessia De Luca) has been verified with all necessary fields. No replanning, aborting, or continuation is needed—the final answer can be produced as per instructions.
