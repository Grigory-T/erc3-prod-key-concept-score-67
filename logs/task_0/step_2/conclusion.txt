I have executed Step 2 by inspecting the available data structures (Pydantic models) which serve as the technical implementation reference in this environment. I analyzed the ProjectBrief, ProjectFull, CustomerBrief, CustomerFull, and TeamMember structures to identify relevant tables and fields. The natural language concepts map to specific fields as confirmed by the printed data structures: project name/description fields, customer name field, and team role field. All facts were verified from the function returns without retrieving actual data rows.

{
  "relevant_tables": ["project", "customer", "team_member", "employee"],
  "field_mapping": {
    "project_name_field": "name",
    "project_description_field": "description",
    "customer_name_field": "name"
  },
  "confirmed": true
}
