Step 2: Determine which technical data structures (tables and fields) should be used to map the question "Who is lead on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?" to database queries, using the available SQL schema as the authoritative technical implementation reference.
Approach: Inspect the provided SQL table definitions to identify which tables and columns represent projects, customers, and project team roles. Confirm that: the project table holds project identifiers, names, and descriptions; the customer table holds customer identifiers and names that could correspond to "RhineMach"; and the team_member table, joined with employee, holds roles such as 'Lead'. Map the natural language concepts "primer optimisation project", "RhineMach", and "machinery frames" to specific fields (e.g., project.name, project.description, customer.name) that will be used in subsequent searches. This step is conceptual and uses the existing schema; no data rows are retrieved yet.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"relevant_tables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "field_mapping": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_field": {"type": "string"}, "project_description_field": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name_field": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["project_name_field", "project_description_field", "customer_name_field"]}, "confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["relevant_tables", "confirmed"]}
