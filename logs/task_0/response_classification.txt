## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames" to understand the exact internal naming or identifiers of this project (treat all terms as potentially ambiguous; the search MUST be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL and account for typos, misspellings, partial matches, and abbreviations).
Approach: Query the wiki_file table using a combination of exact, partial, and fuzzy matching on the content and path fields for keywords and variants such as "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "RhineMach", "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and "machinery frames". Apply a SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search layer (for example, considering that "primer" relates to coatings, paint, surface preparation, etc.) and FUZZY matching to handle spelling variations and spacing. Collect any project names, internal project identifiers (e.g., proj_*), and customer names that appear in context with these terms. Do not take any further action in this step beyond aggregating these references.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"found_references": {"type": "boolean"}, "related_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "related_customers": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found_references"]}
**Result:** I have completed a thorough re-examination of the wiki for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames". After exhaustive fuzzy, semantic, and logical searching across all 19 wiki files:

1. **Found References**: True - The wiki contains general references to "primer" in anti-corrosion systems (mentioned in company/overview.md) and "machinery" as a primary market segment (mentioned in business/markets_and_customers.md). The fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms.

2. **Related Projects**: No specific project identifiers (proj_*) were found anywhere in the wiki content. The project registry file only contains documentation about project structure but no actual project IDs.

3. **Related Customers**: No mention of "RhineMach" or any variant was found in any wiki file. The capitalized words found in fuzzy results (Switzerland, Industrial, Production, etc.) are not customer names related to the search terms.

4. **Notes**: The wiki contains general information about Bellini's business including primer as part of anti-corrosion systems and machinery as a market segment, but no specific documentation for a "primer optimisation" project for "RhineMach machinery frames" exists in the wiki. No project IDs or customer names matching the search criteria were found despite extensive fuzzy, regex, and semantic searching.

I executed the complete step with multiple search strategies: fuzzy matching across all terms, regex pattern matching for specific strings, semantic expansion to related terms (coatings, paint, surface preparation), examination of all 19 wiki files, and re-examination of results for hidden references. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "found_references": true,
  "related_projects": [],
  "related_customers": [],
  "notes": "The wiki contains general references to 'primer' (in anti-corrosion systems) and 'machinery' (as a market segment), but no specific project identifiers (proj_*) or customer 'RhineMach' were found. Fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms (primer, machinery, coatings, etc.) but none in the context of a specific 'primer optimisation' project for 'RhineMach machinery frames'."
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine which technical data structures (tables and fields) should be used to map the question "Who is lead on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?" to database queries, using the available SQL schema as the authoritative technical implementation reference.
Approach: Inspect the provided SQL table definitions to identify which tables and columns represent projects, customers, and project team roles. Confirm that: the project table holds project identifiers, names, and descriptions; the customer table holds customer identifiers and names that could correspond to "RhineMach"; and the team_member table, joined with employee, holds roles such as 'Lead'. Map the natural language concepts "primer optimisation project", "RhineMach", and "machinery frames" to specific fields (e.g., project.name, project.description, customer.name) that will be used in subsequent searches. This step is conceptual and uses the existing schema; no data rows are retrieved yet.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"relevant_tables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "field_mapping": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_field": {"type": "string"}, "project_description_field": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name_field": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["project_name_field", "project_description_field", "customer_name_field"]}, "confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["relevant_tables", "confirmed"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by inspecting the available data structures (Pydantic models) which serve as the technical implementation reference in this environment. I analyzed the ProjectBrief, ProjectFull, CustomerBrief, CustomerFull, and TeamMember structures to identify relevant tables and fields. The natural language concepts map to specific fields as confirmed by the printed data structures: project name/description fields, customer name field, and team role field. All facts were verified from the function returns without retrieving actual data rows.

{
  "relevant_tables": ["project", "customer", "team_member", "employee"],
  "field_mapping": {
    "project_name_field": "name",
    "project_description_field": "description",
    "customer_name_field": "name"
  },
  "confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the most likely project record(s) corresponding to the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" by searching the project and customer data, treating the textual references as potentially ambiguous and applying FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search with allowances for typos and partial matches.
Approach: First, query the customer table to search for a customer whose name matches or approximately matches "RhineMach" (including variants like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and case-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive comparisons). Use exact match where possible, then relax filters using substring search (lowercased, trimmed), then apply fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar) and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle near matches. Next, query the project table using a combination of project.name and project.description, filtering for terms like "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", and "machinery frames" with the same strategy: exact, partial, then fuzzy and semantic matching. If a likely customer for "RhineMach" is identified, further prioritize or filter projects linked via project.customer_id to that customer. Collect all candidate projects with associated match scores and do not yet assume a single correct project if multiple reasonable matches exist.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "project_description": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "match_score"]}}, "search_notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["projects"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 3 exactly as instructed:

1. **Customer Search**: I queried the customer table using multiple strategies:
   - Exact match (case-insensitive): No exact matches
   - Substring match: Found "RhineMach Industrial GROUP" (ID: cust_rhinemach_industrial)
   - Fuzzy matching: The same customer had a 0.51 ratio for "RhineMach"
   - Semantic/logical: Considered variations like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach"

2. **Project Search**: I queried the project table with comprehensive searching:
   - Retrieved all 36 projects with full details (name, description, customer)
   - Applied exact/partial matching for terms: "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "machinery frames", and related terms
   - Applied fuzzy matching on the full phrase "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" (top result had 0.53 ratio)
   - Prioritized projects linked to the RhineMach customer (found 1 direct link)
   - Collected all candidate projects with calculated match scores

3. **Verification of Facts**: All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns:
   - Project IDs, names, descriptions from `get_project()` calls
   - Customer IDs and names from `get_customer()` calls  
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used
   - All 10 projects were found through actual searches and printed in execution

4. **No State Changes**: I did not call any update functions, only read operations.

The search was thorough, applying fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching as requested. The match scores are calculated based on actual term matches and customer linkages found in the data.

Other projects have lower scores and are less relevant (contain only partial matches like 'primer' or 'machinery' but not the full context). The fuzzy search ratio for the top project was 0.53 for the full phrase search."
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (employee BwFV_104, Lazar Petrovski) to read project and team-lead information for the identified candidate project(s).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity, department (Production – Serbia), location (Serbian Plant), and any system roles. Using this identity and the list of candidate project identifiers from the previous step, evaluate company rules and access policies to determine whether the user is allowed to read basic project metadata and team_member records (including which employee has role 'Lead'). Since no specific restrictions are defined for read access to these tables in the provided rules, confirm that such read access is permitted for this user. Record the decision and reasoning without altering any data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_view": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "user_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["can_view", "user_id"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I confirmed the current user identity via who_am_i(), retrieved and tested access to project data for the top candidate project, evaluated company rules, and determined that the user has permission to read project and team-lead information. All facts were verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated employee; no company rules restrict READ access to project metadata or team_member records; successfully retrieved project and team data including lead role in test.",
  "user_id": "BwFV_104",
  "project_ids": ["proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "proj_it_chatbot_pilot_bellini", "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial"]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames", assuming read access is permitted.
Approach: From the candidate projects identified in step 3, select the best-matching project according to the computed match scores and any clear association with the "RhineMach" customer, ensuring that the selection logic accounts for potential naming ambiguities but favors the highest-confidence match. Then, query the team_member table filtered by this project_id and role = 'Lead'. Join the resulting team_member records with the employee table to obtain each lead's employee_id, full name, and email. If no project matches were found, or no team_member with role 'Lead' exists, capture that outcome explicitly instead of fabricating data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "leads": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the checklist. All requirements were met: I executed the step instruction completely, used no assumptions, verified all facts from function returns, included only explicitly printed values in the JSON, performed no state-changing operations, and applied proper selection logic from Step 3 results. The project lead for the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050).

{
  "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
  "leads": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_050",
      "employee_name": "Alessia De Luca",

    }
  ],
  "found": true,
  "notes": "Project 'High-build machinery primer optimisation' has 1 lead(s). The lead is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050)."
}

### Final Result

Approach: Inspect the provided SQL table definitions to identify which tables and columns represent projects, customers, and project team roles. Confirm that: the project table holds project identifiers, names, and descriptions; the customer table holds customer identifiers and names that could correspond to "RhineMach"; and the team_member table, joined with employee, holds roles such as 'Lead'. Map the natural language concepts "primer optimisation project", "RhineMach", and "machinery frames" to specific fields (e.g., project.name, project.description, customer.name) that will be used in subsequent searches. This step is conceptual and uses the existing schema; no data rows are retrieved yet.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"relevant_tables": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "field_mapping": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_field": {"type": "string"}, "project_description_field": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name_field": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["project_name_field", "project_description_field", "customer_name_field"]}, "confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["relevant_tables", "confirmed"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by inspecting the available data structures (Pydantic models) which serve as the technical implementation reference in this environment. I analyzed the ProjectBrief, ProjectFull, CustomerBrief, CustomerFull, and TeamMember structures to identify relevant tables and fields. The natural language concepts map to specific fields as confirmed by the printed data structures: project name/description fields, customer name field, and team role field. All facts were verified from the function returns without retrieving actual data rows.

{
  "relevant_tables": ["project", "customer", "team_member", "employee"],
  "field_mapping": {
    "project_name_field": "name",
    "project_description_field": "description",
    "customer_name_field": "name"
  },
  "confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the most likely project record(s) corresponding to the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" by searching the project and customer data, treating the textual references as potentially ambiguous and applying FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search with allowances for typos and partial matches.
Approach: First, query the customer table to search for a customer whose name matches or approximately matches "RhineMach" (including variants like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and case-insensitive, whitespace-insensitive comparisons). Use exact match where possible, then relax filters using substring search (lowercased, trimmed), then apply fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar) and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle near matches. Next, query the project table using a combination of project.name and project.description, filtering for terms like "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", and "machinery frames" with the same strategy: exact, partial, then fuzzy and semantic matching. If a likely customer for "RhineMach" is identified, further prioritize or filter projects linked via project.customer_id to that customer. Collect all candidate projects with associated match scores and do not yet assume a single correct project if multiple reasonable matches exist.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "project_description": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": "string"}, "customer_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "match_score"]}}, "search_notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["projects"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 3 exactly as instructed:

1. **Customer Search**: I queried the customer table using multiple strategies:
   - Exact match (case-insensitive): No exact matches
   - Substring match: Found "RhineMach Industrial GROUP" (ID: cust_rhinemach_industrial)
   - Fuzzy matching: The same customer had a 0.51 ratio for "RhineMach"
   - Semantic/logical: Considered variations like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach"

2. **Project Search**: I queried the project table with comprehensive searching:
   - Retrieved all 36 projects with full details (name, description, customer)
   - Applied exact/partial matching for terms: "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "machinery frames", and related terms
   - Applied fuzzy matching on the full phrase "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" (top result had 0.53 ratio)
   - Prioritized projects linked to the RhineMach customer (found 1 direct link)
   - Collected all candidate projects with calculated match scores

3. **Verification of Facts**: All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns:
   - Project IDs, names, descriptions from `get_project()` calls
   - Customer IDs and names from `get_customer()` calls  
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used
   - All 10 projects were found through actual searches and printed in execution

4. **No State Changes**: I did not call any update functions, only read operations.

The search was thorough, applying fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching as requested. The match scores are calculated based on actual term matches and customer linkages found in the data.

Other projects have lower scores and are less relevant (contain only partial matches like 'primer' or 'machinery' but not the full context). The fuzzy search ratio for the top project was 0.53 for the full phrase search."
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (employee BwFV_104, Lazar Petrovski) to read project and team-lead information for the identified candidate project(s).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity, department (Production – Serbia), location (Serbian Plant), and any system roles. Using this identity and the list of candidate project identifiers from the previous step, evaluate company rules and access policies to determine whether the user is allowed to read basic project metadata and team_member records (including which employee has role 'Lead'). Since no specific restrictions are defined for read access to these tables in the provided rules, confirm that such read access is permitted for this user. Record the decision and reasoning without altering any data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"can_view": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}, "user_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["can_view", "user_id"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I confirmed the current user identity via who_am_i(), retrieved and tested access to project data for the top candidate project, evaluated company rules, and determined that the user has permission to read project and team-lead information. All facts were verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated employee; no company rules restrict READ access to project metadata or team_member records; successfully retrieved project and team data including lead role in test.",
  "user_id": "BwFV_104",
  "project_ids": ["proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "proj_it_chatbot_pilot_bellini", "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial"]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve the project lead(s) for the specific project that best matches the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames", assuming read access is permitted.
Approach: From the candidate projects identified in step 3, select the best-matching project according to the computed match scores and any clear association with the "RhineMach" customer, ensuring that the selection logic accounts for potential naming ambiguities but favors the highest-confidence match. Then, query the team_member table filtered by this project_id and role = 'Lead'. Join the resulting team_member records with the employee table to obtain each lead's employee_id, full name, and email. If no project matches were found, or no team_member with role 'Lead' exists, capture that outcome explicitly instead of fabricating data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "leads": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_email": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the checklist. All requirements were met: I executed the step instruction completely, used no assumptions, verified all facts from function returns, included only explicitly printed values in the JSON, performed no state-changing operations, and applied proper selection logic from Step 3 results. The project lead for the "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050).

{
  "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
  "leads": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_050",
      "employee_name": "Alessia De Luca",
      "employee_email": "BwFV_050@bellini.internal"
    }
  ],
  "found": true,
  "notes": "Project 'High-build machinery primer optimisation' has 1 lead(s). The lead is Alessia De Luca (employee ID: BwFV_050)."
}

### Final Result
The lead on the 'High-build machinery primer optimisation' project for RhineMach machinery frames is Alessia De Luca (BwFV_050, email: BwFV_050@bellini.internal).

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links
