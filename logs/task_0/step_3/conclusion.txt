I executed Step 3 exactly as instructed:

1. **Customer Search**: I queried the customer table using multiple strategies:
   - Exact match (case-insensitive): No exact matches
   - Substring match: Found "RhineMach Industrial GROUP" (ID: cust_rhinemach_industrial)
   - Fuzzy matching: The same customer had a 0.51 ratio for "RhineMach"
   - Semantic/logical: Considered variations like "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach"

2. **Project Search**: I queried the project table with comprehensive searching:
   - Retrieved all 36 projects with full details (name, description, customer)
   - Applied exact/partial matching for terms: "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "machinery frames", and related terms
   - Applied fuzzy matching on the full phrase "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" (top result had 0.53 ratio)
   - Prioritized projects linked to the RhineMach customer (found 1 direct link)
   - Collected all candidate projects with calculated match scores

3. **Verification of Facts**: All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns:
   - Project IDs, names, descriptions from `get_project()` calls
   - Customer IDs and names from `get_customer()` calls  
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used
   - All 10 projects were found through actual searches and printed in execution

4. **No State Changes**: I did not call any update functions, only read operations.

The search was thorough, applying fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching as requested. The match scores are calculated based on actual term matches and customer linkages found in the data.
