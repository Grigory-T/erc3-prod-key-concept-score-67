I have completed a thorough re-examination of the wiki for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames". After exhaustive fuzzy, semantic, and logical searching across all 19 wiki files:

1. **Found References**: True - The wiki contains general references to "primer" in anti-corrosion systems (mentioned in company/overview.md) and "machinery" as a primary market segment (mentioned in business/markets_and_customers.md). The fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms.

2. **Related Projects**: No specific project identifiers (proj_*) were found anywhere in the wiki content. The project registry file only contains documentation about project structure but no actual project IDs.

3. **Related Customers**: No mention of "RhineMach" or any variant was found in any wiki file. The capitalized words found in fuzzy results (Switzerland, Industrial, Production, etc.) are not customer names related to the search terms.

4. **Notes**: The wiki contains general information about Bellini's business including primer as part of anti-corrosion systems and machinery as a market segment, but no specific documentation for a "primer optimisation" project for "RhineMach machinery frames" exists in the wiki. No project IDs or customer names matching the search criteria were found despite extensive fuzzy, regex, and semantic searching.

I executed the complete step with multiple search strategies: fuzzy matching across all terms, regex pattern matching for specific strings, semantic expansion to related terms (coatings, paint, surface preparation), examination of all 19 wiki files, and re-examination of results for hidden references. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "found_references": true,
  "related_projects": [],
  "related_customers": [],
  "notes": "The wiki contains general references to 'primer' (in anti-corrosion systems) and 'machinery' (as a market segment), but no specific project identifiers (proj_*) or customer 'RhineMach' were found. Fuzzy search returned 540 matches for related terms (primer, machinery, coatings, etc.) but none in the context of a specific 'primer optimisation' project for 'RhineMach machinery frames'."
