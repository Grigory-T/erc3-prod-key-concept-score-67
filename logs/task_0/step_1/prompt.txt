Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation for any mention of a "primer optimisation" project related to "RhineMach" and "machinery frames" to understand the exact internal naming or identifiers of this project (treat all terms as potentially ambiguous; the search MUST be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL and account for typos, misspellings, partial matches, and abbreviations).
Approach: Query the wiki_file table using a combination of exact, partial, and fuzzy matching on the content and path fields for keywords and variants such as "primer optimisation", "primer optimization", "RhineMach", "Rhine Mach", "Rhine-Mach", and "machinery frames". Apply a SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search layer (for example, considering that "primer" relates to coatings, paint, surface preparation, etc.) and FUZZY matching to handle spelling variations and spacing. Collect any project names, internal project identifiers (e.g., proj_*), and customer names that appear in context with these terms. Do not take any further action in this step beyond aggregating these references.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"found_references": {"type": "boolean"}, "related_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "related_customers": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "notes": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["found_references"]}
