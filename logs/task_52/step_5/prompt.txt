Step 5: If permitted, execute the operation to pause the project by setting its status to "paused" in the ProjectRegistry.
Approach: Provided that Step 3 found a single target project and Step 4 confirmed can_update_project_status == true, issue the authorized update through the identified mechanism from Step 2: Update the project record with id equal to the resolved project_id so that project.status is set to the literal value "paused". Use the official ProjectRegistry or UpdateProjectCoreFields API rather than ad-hoc storage. Ensure no other fields are modified. Capture the previous status from the project_record before the update and confirm that the write operation succeeded, or record any error returned by the backend if it fails.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"previous_status":{"type":"string"},"new_status":{"type":"string"},"update_successful":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","new_status","update_successful"]}
