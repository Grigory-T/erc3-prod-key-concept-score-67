STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Step 5 executed successfully. I completed the required action by:

1. **Retrieved project details**: Confirmed the target project "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" exists and captured its previous status as "active" (verified from function return: `Current status: active`).

2. **Executed the update**: Called the `update_project_status` function exactly once with the correct parameters (project_id="proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", status="paused", changed_by="bAsk_001"). This is the official ProjectRegistry API identified in Step 2.

3. **Verified the update**: Confirmed the operation succeeded (function returned `True`) and verified the new status by fetching the project again (status is now "paused").

4. **State change confirmed**: The system displayed a clear state change warning indicating the project status was successfully updated to "paused" and emphasized not to call the function again.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Previous status: "active" (printed from first `get_project` call)
- New status: "paused" (printed from second `get_project` call after update)
- Update success: `True` (return value of `update_project_status`)
- Project ID: Used the exact ID from Step 3

No assumptions were made, no data was invented, and all values come directly from function returns. Only the project status field was modified as required.

{
  "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
  "previous_status": "active",
  "new_status": "paused",
  "update_successful": true,
  "error_message": ""
}
