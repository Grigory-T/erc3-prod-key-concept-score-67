We are now at Step 5 of the task: Pause project proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer.
 According to Step 3, we found the project exactly and it is active.
 According to Step 4, the current user (Luca Rossi, bAsk_001) has permission to update the project status.
 Step 2 identified the update method: the function `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by)`.

 We are to execute the update to set the project status to "paused".

 Steps:
 1. We already have the project_id: "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer"
 2. We need to get the current project to capture the previous status (though the step says we have it from Step 3, but we can get it again to be safe and to confirm it's still active)
 3. Call `update_project_status` with the project_id, status="paused", and changed_by set to the current user (bAsk_001).
 4. Check the result (it returns a boolean) and capture any error if it fails.

 Important: We must not modify any other fields. The `update_project_status` function only changes the status.

 Let's proceed.

 However, note: The step says "Ensure no other fields are modified." The function `update_project_status` is designed to only update the status.

 We'll write Python code to do the following:
   - Get the current project to record the previous status.
   - Call `update_project_status` and print the result.
   - If successful, we can optionally fetch the project again to verify, but the function returns a boolean.

 Since we are to capture the previous status, we'll get the project first.

 Let's code accordingly.

We have successfully updated the project status to "paused". The update was successful and verified by fetching the project again.
 We'll now format the output as required.

We are at Step 5. The previous steps have been completed:
  Step 1: Confirmed that pausing a project means setting status to "paused".
  Step 2: Identified the update method as the `update_project_status` function.
  Step 3: Found the exact project: "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", with previous status "active".
  Step 4: Confirmed that the current user (Luca Rossi, bAsk_001) has permission to update the project status.

 Now Step 5: Execute the update.

 We have already executed the update in the provided code. The update was successful and we verified the new status.

 However, the verification request asks to confirm that we did everything correctly and that the JSON contains only verified data.

 Let's review:
 1. We executed the step instruction: We called `update_project_status` with project_id, status="paused", and changed_by.
 2. We did not skip any actions: We captured the previous status, executed the update, and verified the new status.
 3. All facts were verified by function returns:
    - The project was retrieved by `get_project` and we printed the previous status.
    - The update function was called and returned `True`.
    - We then retrieved the project again and printed the new status.

 The JSON we provided contains:
   project_id: from the project record (we used the same ID as in Step 3)
   previous_status: from the first `get_project` call, printed as "active"
   new_status: from the second `get_project` call, printed as "paused"
   update_successful: from the return of `update_project_status`, which was `True`
   error_message: empty string because there was no error.

 We did not use any made-up data. All values are from function returns.

 We are sure about the results. Therefore, we can provide the same <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

 However, note that the verification step might be concerned about the state-changing operation being called only once. We called it once and it succeeded.

 Let's provide the final answer again.
