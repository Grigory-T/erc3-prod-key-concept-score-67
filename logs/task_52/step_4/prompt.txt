Step 4: Check whether the current user Luca Rossi (bAsk_001) has permission to update the status of the identified project to "paused".
Approach: Using the identified project from Step 3 and the bound identity of the current user (employee_id bAsk_001), call the backend permission check mechanism (e.g., backend_permission_check) for action UpdateProjectCoreFields on the Status field. Internally this should use who_am_i() to retrieve Luca Rossi's system_roles and any relevant attributes, and apply the rule: allow if user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles intersects {"DepartmentLeader","ProjectAdmin","ITAdmin"} OR the user is in an executive leadership role as per company policies. Do not attempt any privilege escalation. Record whether permission is granted and, if denied, capture a non-sensitive denial reason.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_update_project_status":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_source":{"type":"string"},"denial_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_update_project_status"]}
