Step 1: Understand what "pause project" means in Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context and confirm that pausing a project corresponds to setting the project status to "paused".
Approach: Search the internal company wiki and process documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) for terms and variations like "pause project", "project status paused", "pausing a project", and specifically references to project identifiers similar to "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" (accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial names). From the retrieved documents, extract the formal definition of pausing a project, including which field in the ProjectRegistry or project table is changed, valid status values, and any stated constraints. Confirm that the intended technical operation for "pause project" is to update the project.status field to the value "paused".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"understood_process":{"type":"boolean"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"pause_definition":{"type":"string"},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["understood_process","documentation_sources"]}
