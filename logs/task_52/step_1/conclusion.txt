STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki documentation using fuzzy, regex, and semantic search methods. The search confirmed that "pause project" corresponds to setting the project.status field to "paused" in the ProjectRegistry system. This was verified through multiple documentation sources and by checking the actual project structure. No state-changing operations were performed.

  "understood_process": true,
  "documentation_sources": [
    "systems/project_registry.md",
    "systems/crm.md", 
    "systems/chatbot_interface.md"
  ],
  "pause_definition": "Pausing a project means updating the project.status field in the ProjectRegistry to the value 'paused'. This status indicates 'no current activity, but not lost' and is one of the valid project status values aligned with deal phases (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). Only 'active' (and sometimes 'exploring') projects are normally counted toward real workload.",
  "errors": []
}
