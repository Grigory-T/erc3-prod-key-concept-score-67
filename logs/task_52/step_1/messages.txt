## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-12-26
Current actor: Authenticated user bAsk_001
User details: {"id": "bAsk_001", "name": "Luca Rossi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   old = get_employee(id)
#   skills_dicts = [{'name': s.name, 'level': s.level} for s in old.skills]
#   wills_dicts = [{'name': w.name, 'level': w.level} for w in old.wills]
#   update_employee_info(id, salary=new, notes=old.notes, skills=skills_dicts, 
#      wills=wills_dicts, location=old.location, department=old.department)


update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**

department: Corporate Leadership
location: HQ – Italy

is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Pause project: proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 1: Understand what "pause project" means in Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context and confirm that pausing a project corresponds to setting the project status to "paused".
Approach: Search the internal company wiki and process documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) for terms and variations like "pause project", "project status paused", "pausing a project", and specifically references to project identifiers similar to "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" (accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial names). From the retrieved documents, extract the formal definition of pausing a project, including which field in the ProjectRegistry or project table is changed, valid status values, and any stated constraints. Confirm that the intended technical operation for "pause project" is to update the project.status field to the value "paused".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"understood_process":{"type":"boolean"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"pause_definition":{"type":"string"},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["understood_process","documentation_sources"]}

I'll execute this step by searching the company wiki to understand the "pause project" process.

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
================================================================================

1. PROJECT STATUS DEFINITION (from systems/project_registry.md):
   - Status values are aligned with deal phases
   - Valid status values are:
     • idea
     • exploring
     • active
     • paused
     • archived

2. PAUSED STATUS CONTEXT:
   - From line 75-76 of project_registry.md:
     'Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`.'
     'Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload.'

3. CRM CONTEXT (from systems/crm.md):
   - - `paused` – no current activity, but not lost.

4. CHATBOT INTERFACE CAPABILITY:
   - From systems/chatbot_interface.md line 15:
     'Update project team or status.'
   - This confirms the chatbot can update project status.

5. NO EXPLICIT PROCESS DOCUMENTATION FOUND:
   - No detailed workflow or procedure document for pausing projects was found.
   - However, the technical operation is clear: update project.status to 'paused'

================================================================================
VERIFICATION WITH ACTUAL PROJECT:
================================================================================

Project 'proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer' exists.
Current status: active
Project name: High-build machinery primer optimisation
Customer: cust_rhinemach_industrial

Project structure includes these fields (from ProjectFull type):
- id, name, description, customer, status, team

Based on documentation and system structure:
✓ 'pause project' means setting project.status = 'paused'
✓ This is a valid status value according to project_registry.md
✓ The chatbot interface supports updating project status

================================================================================
CONCLUSION:
================================================================================
The technical operation for 'pause project' is to update the project.status
field to the value 'paused' in the ProjectRegistry system.

Based on my comprehensive search of the company wiki documentation, I can now provide a definitive answer about what "pause project" means in Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context.

<final_answer>
I have successfully searched the internal company wiki and process documentation to understand the meaning of "pause project" in Bellini's context. The documentation clearly defines that project status values are aligned with deal phases and include "paused" as a valid status. The technical operation for pausing a project is to update the `project.status` field to the value "paused" in the ProjectRegistry system. This is confirmed by multiple sources including project registry documentation, CRM definitions, and chatbot interface capabilities.

The project "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" exists and is currently in "active" status, confirming that changing its status to "paused" would be the correct technical operation.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 1: Understand what "pause project" means in Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context and confirm that pausing a project corresponds to setting the project status to "paused".
Approach: Search the internal company wiki and process documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) for terms and variations like "pause project", "project status paused", "pausing a project", and specifically references to project identifiers similar to "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" (accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial names). From the retrieved documents, extract the formal definition of pausing a project, including which field in the ProjectRegistry or project table is changed, valid status values, and any stated constraints. Confirm that the intended technical operation for "pause project" is to update the project.status field to the value "paused".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"understood_process":{"type":"boolean"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"pause_definition":{"type":"string"},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["understood_process","documentation_sources"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have executed the step instruction exactly as requested. Let me verify my execution against the checklist:

**Checklist Verification:**

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes
   - Searched internal company wiki using fuzzy and semantic search for terms: "pause project", "project status paused", "pausing a project"
   - Searched for references to project identifiers similar to "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer"
   - Extracted formal definition of pausing a project from retrieved documents
   - Confirmed the technical operation is to update project.status field to "paused"

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ❌ No
   - Used actual function calls: `list_wiki()`, `search_wiki_fuzzy()`, `search_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, `get_project()`
   - All facts derived from function returns, not assumptions
   - No update functions were called (state-changing operations would be inappropriate for this step)

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes
   - Verified project status values from `systems/project_registry.md`: "idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived"
   - Verified paused definition from `systems/crm.md`: "no current activity, but not lost"
   - Verified chatbot capability from `systems/chatbot_interface.md`: "Update project team or status"
   - Verified actual project exists and has status field via `get_project("proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer")`
   - All JSON values come from printed/verified function returns

**Search Strategy Applied:**
- Used fuzzy search for variations of "pause" and project-related terms
- Used regex search for semantic patterns
- Checked for partial matches of project identifier components
- Examined multiple documentation sources
- Verified with actual system data

The JSON response contains only values explicitly printed/verified from function returns. No state was changed since this was an information-gathering step only.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki documentation using fuzzy, regex, and semantic search methods. The search confirmed that "pause project" corresponds to setting the project.status field to "paused" in the ProjectRegistry system. This was verified through multiple documentation sources and by checking the actual project structure. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "understood_process": true,
  "documentation_sources": [
    "systems/project_registry.md",
    "systems/crm.md", 
    "systems/chatbot_interface.md"
  ],
  "pause_definition": "Pausing a project means updating the project.status field in the ProjectRegistry to the value 'paused'. This status indicates 'no current activity, but not lost' and is one of the valid project status values aligned with deal phases (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). Only 'active' (and sometimes 'exploring') projects are normally counted toward real workload.",
