Steps:
  1. Understand what "pause project" means in Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context and confirm that pausing a project corresponds to setting the project status to "paused".
     Approach: Search the internal company wiki and process documentation (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) for terms and variations like "pause project", "project status paused", "pausing a project", and specifically references to project identifiers similar to "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" (accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial names). From the retrieved documents, extract the formal definition of pausing a project, including which field in the ProjectRegistry or project table is changed, valid status values, and any stated constraints. Confirm that the intended technical operation for "pause project" is to update the project.status field to the value "paused".
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"understood_process":{"type":"boolean"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"pause_definition":{"type":"string"},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["understood_process","documentation_sources"]}
  2. Identify the concrete technical mechanism (API or direct database operation) used to update a project's status in the ProjectRegistry.
     Approach: Search the internal technical documentation, service catalog, and code-level references (using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) for the implementation that manages the project table and project status updates. Look for functions or services such as UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager) or equivalent. Confirm whether there is an authorized backend service call (preferred) or if direct SQL update on the project table is the supported method. Also verify which target system (ProjectRegistry) must be used and note any required parameters (e.g., project_id, new status value).
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_update_capability":{"type":"boolean"},"update_method":{"type":"string"},"endpoint_name":{"type":"string"},"documentation_links":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"errors":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["has_update_capability"]}
  3. Locate the target project record corresponding to the provided reference "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" in the project table.
     Approach: Query the ProjectRegistry (backed by the project table) to find the project. First attempt an exact match on project.id == "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer". If not found, relax the search using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching and partial matching: compare lowercase, whitespace-stripped forms, check if the provided string is contained in project.id or project.name, and use fuzzy string comparison to find close candidates accounting for possible typos, misspellings, or truncated identifiers. If multiple candidate projects are found with significant similarity, list them all for potential clarification; if exactly one clear match is found, select it as the target project; if none are found, mark project_not_found.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_type":{"type":"string","enum":["exact","fuzzy","not_found"]},"project_record":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"created_at":{"type":"string"},"updated_at":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","status"]},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_id","project_found","match_type"]}
  4. Check whether the current user Luca Rossi (bAsk_001) has permission to update the status of the identified project to "paused".
     Approach: Using the identified project from Step 3 and the bound identity of the current user (employee_id bAsk_001), call the backend permission check mechanism (e.g., backend_permission_check) for action UpdateProjectCoreFields on the Status field. Internally this should use who_am_i() to retrieve Luca Rossi's system_roles and any relevant attributes, and apply the rule: allow if user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles intersects {"DepartmentLeader","ProjectAdmin","ITAdmin"} OR the user is in an executive leadership role as per company policies. Do not attempt any privilege escalation. Record whether permission is granted and, if denied, capture a non-sensitive denial reason.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_update_project_status":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_source":{"type":"string"},"denial_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_update_project_status"]}
  5. If permitted, execute the operation to pause the project by setting its status to "paused" in the ProjectRegistry.
     Approach: Provided that Step 3 found a single target project and Step 4 confirmed can_update_project_status == true, issue the authorized update through the identified mechanism from Step 2: Update the project record with id equal to the resolved project_id so that project.status is set to the literal value "paused". Use the official ProjectRegistry or UpdateProjectCoreFields API rather than ad-hoc storage. Ensure no other fields are modified. Capture the previous status from the project_record before the update and confirm that the write operation succeeded, or record any error returned by the backend if it fails.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"previous_status":{"type":"string"},"new_status":{"type":"string"},"update_successful":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","new_status","update_successful"]}
