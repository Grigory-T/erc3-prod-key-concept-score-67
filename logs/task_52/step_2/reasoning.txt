We are given the step description: 
 Step 2: Identify the concrete technical mechanism (API or direct database operation) used to update a project's status in the ProjectRegistry.

 We are to search internal technical documentation, service catalog, and code-level references for the implementation that manages the project table and project status updates.

 We have available functions to search the wiki (list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki, search_wiki_fuzzy) and we can also look at the available functions in the system (like update_project_status, update_project_team, etc.). However, note that the step asks for the technical mechanism as documented in the internal documentation, not just the available function.

 Approach:
 1. Use the wiki search functions to look for terms related to project status updates.
 2. Look for function names, API endpoints, or database operations that are mentioned in the documentation.

 We have to output:
   has_update_capability: boolean
   update_method: string (what is the method, e.g., "call to update_project_status function", "direct database update", etc.)
   endpoint_name: string (the name of the function or endpoint, if any)
   documentation_links: array of strings (paths to wiki files that contain the information)
   errors: array of strings

 Since we are in a simulated environment, we don't have a full codebase, but we have the wiki and the available functions. We can use the available functions as a reference.

 However, note that the step says: "Confirm whether there is an authorized backend service call (preferred) or if direct SQL update on the project table is the supported method."

 We have the function `update_project_status` in the available functions. Also, note the company rules: 
   IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
     REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;

 So, there is an action called UpdateProjectCoreFields which includes Status. We are to find the technical mechanism.

 Let's search the wiki for "UpdateProjectCoreFields", "update_project_status", "project status", etc.

 We'll use the provided search functions.

 Steps in code:
  1. Check the wiki for any documentation about updating project status.
  2. We can use list_wiki to get all files and then search each file, or use search_wiki (regex) and search_wiki_fuzzy.

 Let's try:
   - First, use list_wiki to see what files are available.
   - Then, use search_wiki_fuzzy with words like ["UpdateProjectCoreFields", "update_project_status", "project status update"].
   - Also, we can use search_wiki with a regex pattern for "update.*project.*status".

 However, note that the available function is `update_project_status` (exact name). Let's see if that is documented.

 We'll write code to search the wiki for these terms.

 Since we are limited by the available functions, we can only use the provided search functions.

 Let's start by listing the wiki files to get an idea. Then, we can search in each file or use the fuzzy search.

 We'll use search_wiki_fuzzy because it allows us to search for multiple words and returns context.

 We are to look for technical documentation, so we might look for files about the ProjectRegistry or API.

 Let's execute.

[REASONING #7] 2025-12-09 21:35:35

We need to find the concrete technical mechanism (API or direct database operation) for updating project status.
 From the available functions, we see `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool`.
 However, we must confirm this is the intended method by searching documentation.

 We have already loaded `systems/project_registry.md` and `systems/chatbot_interface.md` in the previous step.
 Let's load these files and look for details about updating project status.

 Also, note that the Company Rules mention "UpdateProjectCoreFields" as an action that requires certain permissions.
 We should check if that is the same as `update_project_status` or a more general update function.

 Let's examine the content of the project registry documentation to see if it describes the update mechanism.

[REASONING #8] 2025-12-09 21:36:53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are on Step 2: Identify the concrete technical mechanism (API or direct database operation) used to update a project's status in the ProjectRegistry.
 We have already found:
   - There is an available function: update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
   - The target system is ProjectRegistry.
   - The Company Rules mention an action type "UpdateProjectCoreFields", which is a permission rule.

 We need to confirm the update method (API call or direct DB operation) and note any required parameters.

 From the documentation search and available functions, we can see:
   - The chatbot interface sits on top of legacy systems (CRM, project registry, etc.) and uses APIs to read and write.
   - There is a function `update_project_status` that we can call.

 However, the step asks for the concrete technical mechanism. We have two possibilities:
   1. An authorized backend service call (API) - which is the `update_project_status` function.
   2. Direct SQL update on the project table.

 We must check the documentation for any mention of direct database operations or if the update is done via the function (which in turn calls the backend API).

 From our search:
   - The systems are legacy (Progress OpenEdge) and are accessed via APIs by the chatbot.
   - The documentation does not mention direct database updates as a supported method for users or the chatbot.

 Therefore, the supported method is the `update_project_status` function, which is an API call to the backend service.

 Let's also note the required parameters from the function signature: project_id, status, changed_by.

 We should also check if there are any other endpoints or methods mentioned in the documentation.

 Since we found no evidence of direct database operations and the chatbot uses APIs, we can conclude that the update is done via the `update_project_status` function.

 However, note that the Company Rules mention "UpdateProjectCoreFields" as an action. This is likely the internal name for the permission, and the function `update_project_status` is the implementation.

 Let's format the expected output accordingly.

[REASONING #9] 2025-12-09 21:37:18
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have completed the search and analysis for Step 2. The goal was to identify the concrete technical mechanism for updating a project's status.

From the analysis, we found:
1. The available function `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None)` is the direct method to update a project's status.
2. The target system is the ProjectRegistry, which is a legacy system built on Progress OpenEdge.
3. The chatbot acts as a wrapper/interface to the legacy systems and uses APIs to read/write data.
4. The permission rule in the Company Rules refers to this action as `UpdateProjectCoreFields`.
5. There is no documentation or evidence of direct database/SQL operations being exposed or recommended for updating project status.

Therefore, we can conclude that the update mechanism is the `update_project_status` function, which is a backend service call through the chatbot wrapper.

Now, we need to format the output according to the expected output schema.

Expected Output:
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "has_update_capability": {"type": "boolean"},
    "update_method": {"type": "string"},
    "endpoint_name": {"type": "string"},
    "documentation_links": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
    "errors": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}
  },
  "required": ["has_update_capability"]
}

We will set:
- has_update_capability: true (since the function exists)
- update_method: "Backend API call via chatbot wrapper to ProjectRegistry legacy system"
- endpoint_name: "update_project_status"
- documentation_links: List of wiki files that provided relevant information
- errors: Empty array

Let's collect the documentation links we found relevant:
- "systems/project_registry.md"
- "systems/chatbot_interface.md"
- "systems/overview.md"

We also note that the function is documented in the available functions list (though not in the wiki, so we don't include that as a link).

We'll now produce the final answer.

[REASONING #10] 2025-12-09 21:37:54
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are asked to verify the step accomplishment and ensure we followed instructions correctly.
 We executed a comprehensive search of the documentation and identified the update mechanism.
 We did not perform any state-changing operations (like calling update_project_status) because the step only asks to identify the mechanism.
 We verified the existence of the function and its parameters by examining the available functions list and documentation.
 We confirmed the target system (ProjectRegistry) and the required parameters (project_id, status, changed_by).
 We also noted the permission rule (UpdateProjectCoreFields) from the Company Rules.
 We did not find any direct database/SQL operations being exposed, and the documentation indicates the chatbot acts as a wrapper to legacy systems via APIs.

 Let's double-check that we didn't miss any technical documentation that might describe the database operations.
 We already searched for terms like "SQL", "direct database", "table update", etc., and found no such documentation.
 We also looked at the project registry documentation and found no database schema details.

 Therefore, we are confident that the update mechanism is via the `update_project_status` function, which is a backend service call.

 We have not changed any state, so no need to include state change information.

 We will now repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks as requested.
