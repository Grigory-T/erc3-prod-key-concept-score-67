I have successfully executed Step 2 by comprehensively searching the company's technical documentation using fuzzy, regex, and semantic search methods. The search confirmed that the concrete technical mechanism for updating a project's status is the `update_project_status` function, which is a backend API call through the chatbot wrapper interface to the legacy ProjectRegistry system. No direct database/SQL operations are exposed or documented as the supported method. The target system is ProjectRegistry, and required parameters are project_id, status, and changed_by. No state-changing operations were performed during this investigation.
