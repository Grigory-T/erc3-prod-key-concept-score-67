Step 3: Locate the target project record corresponding to the provided reference "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" in the project table.
Approach: Query the ProjectRegistry (backed by the project table) to find the project. First attempt an exact match on project.id == "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer". If not found, relax the search using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching and partial matching: compare lowercase, whitespace-stripped forms, check if the provided string is contained in project.id or project.name, and use fuzzy string comparison to find close candidates accounting for possible typos, misspellings, or truncated identifiers. If multiple candidate projects are found with significant similarity, list them all for potential clarification; if exactly one clear match is found, select it as the target project; if none are found, mark project_not_found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_type":{"type":"string","enum":["exact","fuzzy","not_found"]},"project_record":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"created_at":{"type":"string"},"updated_at":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","status"]},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_id","project_found","match_type"]}
