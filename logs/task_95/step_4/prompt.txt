Step 4: Fetch all will entries (employee_skill rows with skill_type = 'will') for the employees who are team members of the identified project.
Approach: From the list of employee_ids obtained in step 3, query the employee_skill table for all rows where employee_skill.employee_id is in this set AND employee_skill.skill_type = 'will'. Use exact equality for employee_id and skill_type. For each matching row, collect employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not access or include any salary or hr_notes fields from the employee table.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"will_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"will_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","will_name","level"]}}},"required":["project_id","will_entries"]}
