STEP 4 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:25:01

I have successfully completed Step 4 by fetching all will entries for the team members of the identified project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring". All data was explicitly retrieved from function returns with no assumptions or made-up values.

Verification:
1. ✅ Executed the step instruction exactly: Used employee IDs from Step 3 (bAsk_013, bAsk_040, bAsk_107)
2. ✅ No actions skipped: Called `get_employee()` for each team member to retrieve their will data
3. ✅ All facts verified from function returns: Printed each employee's name, number of wills, and each will with name and level
4. ✅ Used exact equality for employee_id matching
5. ✅ Retrieved only will entries (skill_type = 'will') as shown in the `employee.wills` field
6. ✅ No access to restricted fields (salary, hr_notes) - only used name, wills
7. ✅ No state-changing operations performed

The output contains all 18 will entries exactly as returned by the system, with no modifications or assumptions.
