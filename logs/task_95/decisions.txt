DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:18:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully—the correct project was identified with high confidence according to the plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing information, and step 2 can proceed as written. According to the instructions, if the step returns relevant correct results and the plan remains valid, I should CONTINUE.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:20:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have strictly followed the original plan, produced correct and expected results based on explicit function outputs, and there are no discrepancies or errors. Company policy allows the next step. The necessary project has been identified, permissions confirmed, and now the team members for the identified project must be retrieved. Therefore, the next logical action is to proceed to Step 3.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:22:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced the expected, correct results strictly according to the original plan. The next step (Step 4) is feasible as written: we have a valid list of project team members and their IDs, and have verified permission to read will data for these employees. There are no inconsistencies or missing functions. No replanning is needed; the original plan remains valid and actionable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:25:04
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far produced the exact required outputs as per the Original Plan. The next step is to aggregate the will levels by will_name, summing the values per will and counting distinct contributors, which is possible with the data from Step 4. There are no anomalies, missing information, or unexpected results. The plan remains fully executable as originally written, so proceeding to the next step is justified.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:27:26
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced clear, correct outputs strictly following the original plan. No discrepancies, missing data, or policy violations have been encountered. There is a single remaining step, which is a factual maximum search over the aggregated will values already available. Thus, the plan remains fully valid and we should continue precisely as prescribed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:29:08
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been executed according to the instructions and company policies, with each step verified against expected outcomes and no discrepancies or missing data encountered. The task, 'Which of the wills has most combined potential (sum of wills across team members)?', is now fully answered with explicit supporting data: 'will_travel' has the highest combined potential (total summed level: 19; contributed by all team members). There are no remaining steps or ambiguities, so the task is complete.
