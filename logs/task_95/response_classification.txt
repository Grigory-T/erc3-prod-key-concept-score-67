## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target project record for the project referred to as "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system" in the project table, handling possible typos, alternative spellings, or partial names.
Approach: Query the project table to search for a project whose name or id matches the string "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system". First attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by performing case-insensitive containment checks (after normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic / logical matching to find the closest project names, accounting for potential misspellings, hyphenation differences, or partial phrases such as "loading ramp" or "dock floor system". If multiple candidates are found with similar fuzzy scores, return them all with their similarity scores for potential disambiguation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_project_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["found","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 1 to identify the target project "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system". Here's what I executed:

1. Retrieved current user context (bAsk_013 from Sales & Customer Success)
2. Listed all 36 projects in the system
3. Attempted exact match on project.name and project.id for "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system" - no exact matches found
4. Performed case-insensitive containment check by normalizing strings to lowercase - found one project: "Loading ramp and dock floor system" (ID: proj_nordport_ramp_flooring)
5. Verified this is indeed the target project by:
   - Checking that all words match (loading, ramp, and, dock, floor, system)
   - Calculating a perfect similarity score of 1.000
   - Retrieving full project details to confirm description matches
6. Found additional related projects through keyword searches and included them as lower-scoring candidates
7. No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations)

The primary project has been identified with confidence as it's the only project containing all the keywords and having essentially the same name (only difference is hyphens vs spaces).

{
  "found": true,
  "primary_project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "primary_project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
      "project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
      "similarity_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "project_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Massimo Leone, id bAsk_013) to ensure they are allowed to read project team composition and will data for the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and permission lookup using the bound identity of the current user (employee_id = "bAsk_013") to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that reading from project, team_member, and employee_skill (with skill_type = 'will') for this project is allowed for a regular authenticated employee and does not involve restricted fields such as salary or hr_notes. Confirm that only non-sensitive fields (employee id, name, department, location, skills/wills) will be used in further steps. Set a boolean flag indicating whether Massimo Leone can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_project_team_and_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_project_team_and_wills"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current user. Here's what I verified:

1. **Executed the required function**: Called `who_am_i()` to retrieve the current user's identity and context.
2. **Verified actual data from function returns**: The output showed:
   - `current_user='bAsk_013'`
   - `is_public=False` (authenticated employee)
   - `location='HQ – Italy'`
   - `department='Sales & Customer Success'`
3. **Checked permissions based on company rules**: According to the company rules provided:
   - Authenticated users can read employee profiles with fields: name, email, location, department, basic_role, and context-relevant subset of skills/wills
   - All employees can search for employees by skill/will and get lists with fields: name, location, department, relevant skills/wills
   - We are NOT accessing restricted fields like salary or hr_notes
4. **Limitation noted**: The `who_am_i()` function does not return `system_roles` in its response structure, so this field remains empty. However, based on the user's authenticated status and company rules that allow all employees to read non-sensitive employee data, we can confirm the user has permission.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_013",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_project_team_and_wills": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of team members for the identified project from the team_member table.
Approach: Using the primary_project_id from step 1 (assuming can_read_project_team_and_wills is true from step 2), query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.project_id equals the target project id. Do not perform fuzzy matching here; use exact equality on project_id. For each team member record, collect employee_id, role, and time_slice. If no team members are found, this fact should be reflected in the output.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 3 by retrieving the list of team members for project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring" using exact project ID matching. No fuzzy matching was performed. All data was explicitly retrieved from function returns with no assumptions or made-up values. Verified 3 team members with their employee IDs, roles, and time slices. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "team_members": [
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_013",
      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_040",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_107",
      "role": "Ops",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Fetch all will entries (employee_skill rows with skill_type = 'will') for the employees who are team members of the identified project.
Approach: From the list of employee_ids obtained in step 3, query the employee_skill table for all rows where employee_skill.employee_id is in this set AND employee_skill.skill_type = 'will'. Use exact equality for employee_id and skill_type. For each matching row, collect employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not access or include any salary or hr_notes fields from the employee table.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"will_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"will_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","will_name","level"]}}},"required":["project_id","will_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 4 by fetching all will entries for the team members of the identified project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring". All data was explicitly retrieved from function returns with no assumptions or made-up values.

Verification:
1. ✅ Executed the step instruction exactly: Used employee IDs from Step 3 (bAsk_013, bAsk_040, bAsk_107)
2. ✅ No actions skipped: Called `get_employee()` for each team member to retrieve their will data
3. ✅ All facts verified from function returns: Printed each employee's name, number of wills, and each will with name and level
4. ✅ Used exact equality for employee_id matching
5. ✅ Retrieved only will entries (skill_type = 'will') as shown in the `employee.wills` field
6. ✅ No access to restricted fields (salary, hr_notes) - only used name, wills
7. ✅ No state-changing operations performed

The output contains all 18 will entries exactly as returned by the system, with no modifications or assumptions.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "will_entries": [
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 5},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 2},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 3},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 3},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 6}
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Aggregate the will levels across all project team members by will_name to compute the combined potential for each will.
Approach: Take the will_entries from step 4 and group them by will_name. For each distinct will_name, sum the level values across all employees to get total_level, and count how many distinct employees contribute to that will (member_count). Do not weight by time_slice unless explicitly requested (the task only asks for sum of wills across team members). Produce a list of aggregated will records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","aggregated_wills"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the verification checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: I took the will_entries from Step 4 and grouped them by will_name, summing the level values and counting distinct employees for each will.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact will_entries data from Step 4 as provided in the task context
   - Performed grouping by will_name as instructed
   - Calculated total_level by summing level values across all employees for each will
   - Calculated member_count by counting distinct employee_ids for each will
   - Did not weight by time_slice as explicitly instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The will_entries data came directly from Step 4 which was retrieved from actual system calls (get_employee() for each team member)
   - All calculations were performed on actual data values (5+6+4=15 for will_cross_site, etc.)
   - No make-up data or sensible defaults were used

4. **State-changing operations**: None performed - only data aggregation calculations

5. **Data verification**: Re-calculated all sums to ensure accuracy:
   - will_cross_site: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 ✓
   - will_digitalisation: 6 + 4 + 6 = 16 ✓
   - will_mentor_juniors: 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 ✓
   - will_people_management: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 ✓
   - will_process_improvement: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 ✓
   - will_travel: 7 + 6 + 6 = 19 ✓

All requirements for Step 5 have been met with complete verification of facts from actual data returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "aggregated_wills": [
    {"will_name": "will_cross_site", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_digitalisation", "total_level": 16, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "total_level": 12, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_people_management", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_process_improvement", "total_level": 14, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_travel", "total_level": 19, "member_count": 3}
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Determine which will or wills have the highest combined potential (maximum sum of levels) across the project team.
Approach: From the aggregated_wills list from step 5, identify the maximum total_level value. Select all will_name entries whose total_level equals this maximum, allowing for ties. Return the list of top will(s), the corresponding total_level (combined potential), and the full ranking if needed for context. This will directly answer which of the wills has most combined potential for cheering up the team.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"max_total_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"top_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}},"all_aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","max_total_level","top_wills","all_aggregated_wills"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 6 by determining which will has the highest combined potential across the project team. The analysis was performed on the aggregated_wills data from Step 5, calculating the maximum total_level value and identifying all wills that achieve this maximum (allowing for ties). Only one will, "will_travel", has the highest combined potential with a total_level of 19. All team members contribute to this will with level 7, 6, and 6 respectively, showing strong team alignment on travel-related interests. All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "max_total_level": 19,
  "top_wills": [
    {
      "will_name": "will_travel",
      "total_level": 19,
      "member_count": 3
    }
  ],
  "all_aggregated_wills": [
    {
      "will_name": "will_cross_site",
      "total_level": 15,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_digitalisation",
      "total_level": 16,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors",
      "total_level": 12,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_people_management",
      "total_level": 15,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_process_improvement",
      "total_level": 14,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_travel",
      "total_level": 19,
      "member_count": 3
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The will with the most combined potential across the 'Loading ramp and dock floor system' project team is 'will_travel', with a total summed level of 19 (contributed by all three team members). This means that 'Travel' is the strongest shared will—and an excellent theme to use for cheering up and energizing your project team!

4. Performed case-insensitive containment check by normalizing strings to lowercase - found one project: "Loading ramp and dock floor system" (ID: proj_nordport_ramp_flooring)
5. Verified this is indeed the target project by:
   - Checking that all words match (loading, ramp, and, dock, floor, system)
   - Calculating a perfect similarity score of 1.000
   - Retrieving full project details to confirm description matches
6. Found additional related projects through keyword searches and included them as lower-scoring candidates
7. No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations)

The primary project has been identified with confidence as it's the only project containing all the keywords and having essentially the same name (only difference is hyphens vs spaces).

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Massimo Leone, id bAsk_013) to ensure they are allowed to read project team composition and will data for the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and permission lookup using the bound identity of the current user (employee_id = "bAsk_013") to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that reading from project, team_member, and employee_skill (with skill_type = 'will') for this project is allowed for a regular authenticated employee and does not involve restricted fields such as salary or hr_notes. Confirm that only non-sensitive fields (employee id, name, department, location, skills/wills) will be used in further steps. Set a boolean flag indicating whether Massimo Leone can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_project_team_and_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_project_team_and_wills"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current user. Here's what I verified:

1. **Executed the required function**: Called `who_am_i()` to retrieve the current user's identity and context.
2. **Verified actual data from function returns**: The output showed:
   - `current_user='bAsk_013'`
   - `is_public=False` (authenticated employee)
   - `location='HQ – Italy'`
   - `department='Sales & Customer Success'`
3. **Checked permissions based on company rules**: According to the company rules provided:
   - Authenticated users can read employee profiles with fields: name, email, location, department, basic_role, and context-relevant subset of skills/wills
   - All employees can search for employees by skill/will and get lists with fields: name, location, department, relevant skills/wills
   - We are NOT accessing restricted fields like salary or hr_notes
4. **Limitation noted**: The `who_am_i()` function does not return `system_roles` in its response structure, so this field remains empty. However, based on the user's authenticated status and company rules that allow all employees to read non-sensitive employee data, we can confirm the user has permission.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_013",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_project_team_and_wills": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of team members for the identified project from the team_member table.
Approach: Using the primary_project_id from step 1 (assuming can_read_project_team_and_wills is true from step 2), query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.project_id equals the target project id. Do not perform fuzzy matching here; use exact equality on project_id. For each team member record, collect employee_id, role, and time_slice. If no team members are found, this fact should be reflected in the output.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 3 by retrieving the list of team members for project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring" using exact project ID matching. No fuzzy matching was performed. All data was explicitly retrieved from function returns with no assumptions or made-up values. Verified 3 team members with their employee IDs, roles, and time slices. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "team_members": [
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_013",
      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_040",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_107",
      "role": "Ops",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Fetch all will entries (employee_skill rows with skill_type = 'will') for the employees who are team members of the identified project.
Approach: From the list of employee_ids obtained in step 3, query the employee_skill table for all rows where employee_skill.employee_id is in this set AND employee_skill.skill_type = 'will'. Use exact equality for employee_id and skill_type. For each matching row, collect employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not access or include any salary or hr_notes fields from the employee table.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"will_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"will_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","will_name","level"]}}},"required":["project_id","will_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 4 by fetching all will entries for the team members of the identified project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring". All data was explicitly retrieved from function returns with no assumptions or made-up values.

Verification:
1. ✅ Executed the step instruction exactly: Used employee IDs from Step 3 (bAsk_013, bAsk_040, bAsk_107)
2. ✅ No actions skipped: Called `get_employee()` for each team member to retrieve their will data
3. ✅ All facts verified from function returns: Printed each employee's name, number of wills, and each will with name and level
4. ✅ Used exact equality for employee_id matching
5. ✅ Retrieved only will entries (skill_type = 'will') as shown in the `employee.wills` field
6. ✅ No access to restricted fields (salary, hr_notes) - only used name, wills
7. ✅ No state-changing operations performed

The output contains all 18 will entries exactly as returned by the system, with no modifications or assumptions.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "will_entries": [
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 5},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 2},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 3},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_cross_site", "level": 4},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 3},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_people_management", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 6},
    {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "will_name": "will_travel", "level": 6}
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Aggregate the will levels across all project team members by will_name to compute the combined potential for each will.
Approach: Take the will_entries from step 4 and group them by will_name. For each distinct will_name, sum the level values across all employees to get total_level, and count how many distinct employees contribute to that will (member_count). Do not weight by time_slice unless explicitly requested (the task only asks for sum of wills across team members). Produce a list of aggregated will records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","aggregated_wills"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the verification checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: I took the will_entries from Step 4 and grouped them by will_name, summing the level values and counting distinct employees for each will.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact will_entries data from Step 4 as provided in the task context
   - Performed grouping by will_name as instructed
   - Calculated total_level by summing level values across all employees for each will
   - Calculated member_count by counting distinct employee_ids for each will
   - Did not weight by time_slice as explicitly instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The will_entries data came directly from Step 4 which was retrieved from actual system calls (get_employee() for each team member)
   - All calculations were performed on actual data values (5+6+4=15 for will_cross_site, etc.)
   - No make-up data or sensible defaults were used

4. **State-changing operations**: None performed - only data aggregation calculations

5. **Data verification**: Re-calculated all sums to ensure accuracy:
   - will_cross_site: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 ✓
   - will_digitalisation: 6 + 4 + 6 = 16 ✓
   - will_mentor_juniors: 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 ✓
   - will_people_management: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 ✓
   - will_process_improvement: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 ✓
   - will_travel: 7 + 6 + 6 = 19 ✓

All requirements for Step 5 have been met with complete verification of facts from actual data returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "aggregated_wills": [
    {"will_name": "will_cross_site", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_digitalisation", "total_level": 16, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "total_level": 12, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_people_management", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_process_improvement", "total_level": 14, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_travel", "total_level": 19, "member_count": 3}
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Determine which will or wills have the highest combined potential (maximum sum of levels) across the project team.
Approach: From the aggregated_wills list from step 5, identify the maximum total_level value. Select all will_name entries whose total_level equals this maximum, allowing for ties. Return the list of top will(s), the corresponding total_level (combined potential), and the full ranking if needed for context. This will directly answer which of the wills has most combined potential for cheering up the team.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"max_total_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"top_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}},"all_aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","max_total_level","top_wills","all_aggregated_wills"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 6 by determining which will has the highest combined potential across the project team. The analysis was performed on the aggregated_wills data from Step 5, calculating the maximum total_level value and identifying all wills that achieve this maximum (allowing for ties). Only one will, "will_travel", has the highest combined potential with a total_level of 19. All team members contribute to this will with level 7, 6, and 6 respectively, showing strong team alignment on travel-related interests. All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data.

{
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "max_total_level": 19,
  "top_wills": [
    {
      "will_name": "will_travel",
      "total_level": 19,
      "member_count": 3
    }
  ],
  "all_aggregated_wills": [
    {
      "will_name": "will_cross_site",
      "total_level": 15,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_digitalisation",
      "total_level": 16,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_mentor_juniors",
      "total_level": 12,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_people_management",
      "total_level": 15,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_process_improvement",
      "total_level": 14,
      "member_count": 3
    },
    {
      "will_name": "will_travel",
      "total_level": 19,
      "member_count": 3
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The will with the most combined potential across the 'Loading ramp and dock floor system' project team is 'will_travel', with a total summed level of 19 (contributed by all three team members). This means that 'Travel' is the strongest shared will—and an excellent theme to use for cheering up and energizing your project team!

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system

- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
