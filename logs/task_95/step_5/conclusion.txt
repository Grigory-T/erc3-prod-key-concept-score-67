STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:27:23

I have verified the execution of Step 5 against the verification checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: I took the will_entries from Step 4 and grouped them by will_name, summing the level values and counting distinct employees for each will.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact will_entries data from Step 4 as provided in the task context
   - Performed grouping by will_name as instructed
   - Calculated total_level by summing level values across all employees for each will
   - Calculated member_count by counting distinct employee_ids for each will
   - Did not weight by time_slice as explicitly instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The will_entries data came directly from Step 4 which was retrieved from actual system calls (get_employee() for each team member)
   - All calculations were performed on actual data values (5+6+4=15 for will_cross_site, etc.)
   - No make-up data or sensible defaults were used

4. **State-changing operations**: None performed - only data aggregation calculations

5. **Data verification**: Re-calculated all sums to ensure accuracy:
   - will_cross_site: 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 ✓
   - will_digitalisation: 6 + 4 + 6 = 16 ✓
   - will_mentor_juniors: 7 + 2 + 3 = 12 ✓
   - will_people_management: 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 ✓
   - will_process_improvement: 4 + 4 + 6 = 14 ✓
   - will_travel: 7 + 6 + 6 = 19 ✓

All requirements for Step 5 have been met with complete verification of facts from actual data returns.
