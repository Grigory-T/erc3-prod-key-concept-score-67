Step 5: Aggregate the will levels across all project team members by will_name to compute the combined potential for each will.
Approach: Take the will_entries from step 4 and group them by will_name. For each distinct will_name, sum the level values across all employees to get total_level, and count how many distinct employees contribute to that will (member_count). Do not weight by time_slice unless explicitly requested (the task only asks for sum of wills across team members). Produce a list of aggregated will records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","aggregated_wills"]}
