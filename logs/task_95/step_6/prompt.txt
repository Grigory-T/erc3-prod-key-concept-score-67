Step 6: Determine which will or wills have the highest combined potential (maximum sum of levels) across the project team.
Approach: From the aggregated_wills list from step 5, identify the maximum total_level value. Select all will_name entries whose total_level equals this maximum, allowing for ties. Return the list of top will(s), the corresponding total_level (combined potential), and the full ranking if needed for context. This will directly answer which of the wills has most combined potential for cheering up the team.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"max_total_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"top_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}},"all_aggregated_wills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"will_name":{"type":"string"},"total_level":{"type":"integer"},"member_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["will_name","total_level","member_count"]}}},"required":["project_id","max_total_level","top_wills","all_aggregated_wills"]}
