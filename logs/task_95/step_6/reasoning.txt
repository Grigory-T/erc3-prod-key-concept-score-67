We are at Step 6 of the task. We need to determine which will(s) have the highest combined potential (maximum sum of levels) across the project team.

 From Step 5, we have the aggregated_wills for project "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring". Let me recall the data from Step 5:

 aggregated_wills = [
    {"will_name": "will_cross_site", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_digitalisation", "total_level": 16, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_mentor_juniors", "total_level": 12, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_people_management", "total_level": 15, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_process_improvement", "total_level": 14, "member_count": 3},
    {"will_name": "will_travel", "total_level": 19, "member_count": 3}
 ]

 We need to find the maximum total_level, which is 19 (from will_travel). Then, we select all will_name entries with total_level 19. In this case, only one will has 19.

 However, note that the step says: "allow for ties". So we will select all with the maximum.

 We also need to return:
   - project_id (from step 5: "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring")
   - max_total_level (the maximum total_level value)
   - top_wills: list of aggregated will objects that have total_level equal to max_total_level
   - all_aggregated_wills: the entire list from step 5 (for context)

 Let me write Python code to compute this. We are not making any API calls in this step, just processing the data from step 5.

 However, note that the step instruction says: "Return the list of top will(s), the corresponding total_level (combined potential), and the full ranking if needed for context."

 We are also to return the full ranking (all_aggregated_wills) as per the expected output.

 Let's do it.

We have successfully executed Step 6. We found that the will with the highest combined potential is "will_travel" with a total_level of 19 and member_count of 3. There are no ties in this case.

Now, we need to output the result in the specified JSON format, including:
- project_id: the project ID from the previous steps
- max_total_level: the maximum total_level we found (19)
- top_wills: an array of the top will(s) - in this case just one
- all_aggregated_wills: the entire list of aggregated wills from Step 5

We have all the required data. Let's create the final answer.

We are verifying the execution of Step 6.
 We have already executed the step and printed the results.
 Let's check the checklist:

 1. Did you execute the step instruction?
    - Yes, we took the aggregated_wills from Step 5, found the maximum total_level, and selected all wills with that maximum.

 2. Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
    - No, we performed the exact steps as per the approach.

 3. Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
    - Yes, the aggregated_wills data came from Step 5, which was derived from function returns (get_employee for each team member). We did not assume any values.

 4. JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
    - The aggregated_wills were printed in Step 5 and we used that same data. We printed the current user context but that is not part of the required output.

 5. We did not use any make-up data or sensible defaults. All facts are derived from function returns.

 6. We did not need fuzzy matching because we are working with data from the previous step.

 7. We did not change any state (no update functions called).

 Therefore, the results are verified.

 Let's provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks again.
