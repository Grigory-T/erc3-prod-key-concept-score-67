STEP 6 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:29:03

I have successfully completed Step 6 by determining which will has the highest combined potential across the project team. The analysis was performed on the aggregated_wills data from Step 5, calculating the maximum total_level value and identifying all wills that achieve this maximum (allowing for ties). Only one will, "will_travel", has the highest combined potential with a total_level of 19. All team members contribute to this will with level 7, 6, and 6 respectively, showing strong team alignment on travel-related interests. All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data.
