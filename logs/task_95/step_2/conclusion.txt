I have successfully completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current user. Here's what I verified:

1. **Executed the required function**: Called `who_am_i()` to retrieve the current user's identity and context.
2. **Verified actual data from function returns**: The output showed:
   - `current_user='bAsk_013'`
   - `is_public=False` (authenticated employee)
   - `location='HQ – Italy'`
   - `department='Sales & Customer Success'`
3. **Checked permissions based on company rules**: According to the company rules provided:
   - Authenticated users can read employee profiles with fields: name, email, location, department, basic_role, and context-relevant subset of skills/wills
   - All employees can search for employees by skill/will and get lists with fields: name, location, department, relevant skills/wills
   - We are NOT accessing restricted fields like salary or hr_notes
4. **Limitation noted**: The `who_am_i()` function does not return `system_roles` in its response structure, so this field remains empty. However, based on the user's authenticated status and company rules that allow all employees to read non-sensitive employee data, we can confirm the user has permission.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_013",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_project_team_and_wills": true
}
