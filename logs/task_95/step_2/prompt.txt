Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Massimo Leone, id bAsk_013) to ensure they are allowed to read project team composition and will data for the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and permission lookup using the bound identity of the current user (employee_id = "bAsk_013") to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that reading from project, team_member, and employee_skill (with skill_type = 'will') for this project is allowed for a regular authenticated employee and does not involve restricted fields such as salary or hr_notes. Confirm that only non-sensitive fields (employee id, name, department, location, skills/wills) will be used in further steps. Set a boolean flag indicating whether Massimo Leone can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_project_team_and_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_project_team_and_wills"]}
