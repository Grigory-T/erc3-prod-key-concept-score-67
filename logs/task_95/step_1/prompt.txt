Step 1: Identify the target project record for the project referred to as "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system" in the project table, handling possible typos, alternative spellings, or partial names.
Approach: Query the project table to search for a project whose name or id matches the string "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system". First attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by performing case-insensitive containment checks (after normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic / logical matching to find the closest project names, accounting for potential misspellings, hyphenation differences, or partial phrases such as "loading ramp" or "dock floor system". If multiple candidates are found with similar fuzzy scores, return them all with their similarity scores for potential disambiguation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_project_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["found","candidates"]}
