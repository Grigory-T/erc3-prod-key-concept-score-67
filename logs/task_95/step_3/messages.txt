## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-10-02
Current actor: Authenticated user bAsk_013
User details: {"id": "bAsk_013", "name": "Massimo Leone", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** I need to cheer up everybody in project Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system. Which of the wills has most combined potential? (sum of wills across team members)

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target project record for the project referred to as "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system" in the project table, handling possible typos, alternative spellings, or partial names.
Approach: Query the project table to search for a project whose name or id matches the string "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system". First attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by performing case-insensitive containment checks (after normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic / logical matching to find the closest project names, accounting for potential misspellings, hyphenation differences, or partial phrases such as "loading ramp" or "dock floor system". If multiple candidates are found with similar fuzzy scores, return them all with their similarity scores for potential disambiguation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_project_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["found","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 1 to identify the target project "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system". Here's what I executed:

1. Retrieved current user context (bAsk_013 from Sales & Customer Success)
2. Listed all 36 projects in the system
3. Attempted exact match on project.name and project.id for "Loading-ramp-and-dock-floor-system" - no exact matches found
4. Performed case-insensitive containment check by normalizing strings to lowercase - found one project: "Loading ramp and dock floor system" (ID: proj_nordport_ramp_flooring)
5. Verified this is indeed the target project by:
   - Checking that all words match (loading, ramp, and, dock, floor, system)
   - Calculating a perfect similarity score of 1.000
   - Retrieving full project details to confirm description matches
6. Found additional related projects through keyword searches and included them as lower-scoring candidates
7. No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations)

The primary project has been identified with confidence as it's the only project containing all the keywords and having essentially the same name (only difference is hyphens vs spaces).

{
  "found": true,
  "primary_project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "primary_project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
      "project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
      "similarity_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "project_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "similarity_score": 0.333
    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Massimo Leone, id bAsk_013) to ensure they are allowed to read project team composition and will data for the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and permission lookup using the bound identity of the current user (employee_id = "bAsk_013") to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that reading from project, team_member, and employee_skill (with skill_type = 'will') for this project is allowed for a regular authenticated employee and does not involve restricted fields such as salary or hr_notes. Confirm that only non-sensitive fields (employee id, name, department, location, skills/wills) will be used in further steps. Set a boolean flag indicating whether Massimo Leone can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_project_team_and_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_project_team_and_wills"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current user. Here's what I verified:

1. **Executed the required function**: Called `who_am_i()` to retrieve the current user's identity and context.
2. **Verified actual data from function returns**: The output showed:
   - `current_user='bAsk_013'`
   - `is_public=False` (authenticated employee)
   - `location='HQ – Italy'`
   - `department='Sales & Customer Success'`
3. **Checked permissions based on company rules**: According to the company rules provided:
   - Authenticated users can read employee profiles with fields: name, email, location, department, basic_role, and context-relevant subset of skills/wills
   - All employees can search for employees by skill/will and get lists with fields: name, location, department, relevant skills/wills
   - We are NOT accessing restricted fields like salary or hr_notes
4. **Limitation noted**: The `who_am_i()` function does not return `system_roles` in its response structure, so this field remains empty. However, based on the user's authenticated status and company rules that allow all employees to read non-sensitive employee data, we can confirm the user has permission.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_013",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_project_team_and_wills": true
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Retrieve the list of team members for the identified project from the team_member table.
Approach: Using the primary_project_id from step 1 (assuming can_read_project_team_and_wills is true from step 2), query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.project_id equals the target project id. Do not perform fuzzy matching here; use exact equality on project_id. For each team member record, collect employee_id, role, and time_slice. If no team members are found, this fact should be reflected in the output.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}

I'll execute Step 3 by retrieving the team members for the identified project.

```python
# First, let's verify the current user context again
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Location: {ctx.location}")
print(f"Is public: {ctx.is_public}")
print(f"Today: {ctx.today}")
print()

# From Step 1, we have the primary project ID
project_id = "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring"
print(f"Retrieving team members for project: {project_id}")
print()

# Get the project details to access the team list
project = get_project(project_id)
if project is None:
    print(f"ERROR: Project with ID '{project_id}' not found!")

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Retrieve the list of team members for the identified project from the team_member table.
Approach: Using the primary_project_id from step 1 (assuming can_read_project_team_and_wills is true from step 2), query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.project_id equals the target project id. Do not perform fuzzy matching here; use exact equality on project_id. For each team member record, collect employee_id, role, and time_slice. If no team members are found, this fact should be reflected in the output.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
