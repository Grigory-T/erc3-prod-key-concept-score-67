We are to retrieve the list of team members for the project identified in step 1.
 Step 1 provided primary_project_id: "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring"
 We assume we have permission (step 2 returned can_read_project_team_and_wills: true)

 Approach:
  1. We will get the project by its ID to retrieve the team list.
  2. The function `get_project(project_id)` returns a ProjectFull object which includes a team list (list of TeamMember).
  3. We will extract for each team member: employee id, role, time_slice.

 Note: The TeamMember object in ProjectFull has:
        employee: str (this is the employee id)
        role: str
        time_slice: float

 However, note that the function returns a ProjectFull object with team: list[TeamMember].
 We must use the exact field names: employee (for employee_id), role, time_slice.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

We are in a code block and need to fix the syntax error. The issue is with indentation or structure.
 Let me rewrite the code with proper indentation and structure.

 We need to:
 1. Get the project details using get_project(project_id)
 2. If project is found, extract the team members (list of TeamMember objects)
 3. Format the output as required

 Note: The error message points to an `else:` without a preceding `if` at the same level.
 Looking at the code, I see that the `else` on line 61 is at the same level as the `if` on line 51, but there's a code block in between that might be causing issues.

 Let me restructure the code more cleanly.

We have successfully retrieved the team members for the project. The output shows 3 team members with their employee IDs, roles, and time slices.
 Now, we need to format the output as per the expected output schema.
 The expected output requires:
   - project_id (string)
   - team_members (array of objects, each with employee_id, role, time_slice)

 We have:
   project_id = "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring"
   team_members = [
        {"employee_id": "bAsk_013", "role": "Lead", "time_slice": 0.4},
        {"employee_id": "bAsk_040", "role": "Engineer", "time_slice": 0.3},
        {"employee_id": "bAsk_107", "role": "Ops", "time_slice": 0.3}
   ]

 Let's produce the JSON accordingly.

We need to verify that the step has been accomplished exactly as described.

Step 3 requires:
- Using the primary_project_id from step 1: we used "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring" (which was the result of step 1).
- Query the team_member table: we used get_project(project_id) which returns the project with a team list. The team list in the ProjectFull object corresponds to the team_member records for that project.
- We used exact equality on project_id by calling get_project with that exact ID.
- We collected employee_id, role, and time_slice for each team member.
- We printed and verified the team members (3 members).
- We did not perform fuzzy matching here (as instructed).
- We reflected the fact that team members were found (array of 3).

Checklist:
1. We executed the step instruction: yes, we retrieved the team members for the identified project.
2. We did not skip any actions: we got the project, extracted the team, and verified employee details (which was extra but not harmful). The step did not require verification of employee details, but it doesn't hurt.
3. All facts are verified: we printed the project details and team members from the function returns. The employee verification was extra and confirmed the employee IDs exist.

JSON response: we provided the project_id and team_members array with the exact data from the function returns.

We did not use any make-up data: all data came from get_project and get_employee calls.

We did not change state: we only read data.

Thus, the step is complete. We can repeat the final_answer and json blocks.
