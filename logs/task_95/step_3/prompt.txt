Step 3: Retrieve the list of team members for the identified project from the team_member table.
Approach: Using the primary_project_id from step 1 (assuming can_read_project_team_and_wills is true from step 2), query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.project_id equals the target project id. Do not perform fuzzy matching here; use exact equality on project_id. For each team member record, collect employee_id, role, and time_slice. If no team members are found, this fact should be reflected in the output.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}
