DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:06:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The first step is completed as planned; user identity and inferred role are established with no unexpected results or deviations. There are no errors, missing data, or process complications, and the subsequent steps are still valid as originally written. All information necessary for the next step (employee search for 'Bianchi') is present per the plan. There is no reason to change approach or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:10:08
Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
Step 2 produced an ambiguous result with two employees ('Marco Bianchi' and 'Sofia Bianchi') having identical match scores for the name 'Bianchi.' The original plan requires a single, selected employee to proceed with the subsequent steps. The ambiguity blocks normal progression, and there is no instruction in the original plan for resolving this automatically. Thus, the steps as written cannot proceed without clarification on which 'Bianchi' is meant, and replanning is needed to address ambiguity or request additional input.
