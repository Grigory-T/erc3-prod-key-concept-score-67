# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-10
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_133
User details: {"id": "QR23_133", "name": "Armando Fontana", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (limit_reached)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current user and their permissions using a who_am_i() style check, to understand what access Human Resources employee Armando Fontana (QR23_133) has regarding employee and project team membership data.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity and authorization service (who_am_i or equivalent) to retrieve the current authenticated user profile, including user identifier, department, location, and system roles (for example, Human Resources administrator, manager, Information Technology administrator). This step does not need project or employee context yet and only focuses on retrieving the current user metadata and role set that will later be used in a focused permission check. No additional actions are combined here.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I executed the step to identify the current user and their permissions. I called the `who_am_i()` function which returned the authenticated user context, and then retrieved the full employee record using `get_employee("QR23_133")` to examine all available fields.

The verified facts are:
- User ID: QR23_133 (Armando Fontana)
- Department: Human Resources (HR) 
- Location: HQ – Italy
- The employee record shows skills including "skill_progress_admin" and wills including "will_people_management", which indicate administrative and management capabilities

Regarding system roles: The available functions do not return an explicit `system_roles` field. The `who_am_i()` function returns a `WhoAmI` object without system roles, and the `get_employee()` function returns an `EmployeeFull` object that also doesn't include system roles. Based on the company rules and the user's HR department membership, HR employees typically have the 'HRAdmin' role for accessing employee data. However, this is an inference rather than an explicitly verified fact from function returns.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "QR23_133",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": ["HRAdmin"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Find the employee record corresponding to the person referred to as "Bianchi" in the question, resolving their exact employee identifier in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table to search for any employees whose name field matches or contains "Bianchi". Start with exact match on full name and surname (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search, then fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for spelling mistakes and partial names, and finally semantic or logical interpretation if "Bianchi" could appear as part of a longer name (for example, "Luca Bianchi", "Bianchi Maria"). Ensure the search is FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL as required, and also consider that the term might appear in different name orderings or with accents. If multiple candidate employees are found, list them all with a match score so that the best match or an ambiguity can be determined without yet deciding on the final one in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_employee":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","candidates","selected_employee","ambiguous"]}
**Result:** I have completed step 2 to find the employee record for "Bianchi". The verification process confirmed there are 2 employees with the last name "Bianchi" in the system, both with identical fuzzy match scores of 0.70. This creates an ambiguous situation where we cannot definitively select one employee without additional context.

The search process included:
1. Retrieving all 154 employees in the system
2. Searching for exact matches (none found)
3. Searching for substring matches (found 2 employees: Marco Bianchi and Sofia Bianchi)
4. Using fuzzy matching to calculate precise match scores (both scored 0.70)
5. Determining that with multiple equally strong matches, this is an ambiguous result

Both candidates are equally likely matches based on the name "Bianchi" alone. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

  "search_term": "Bianchi",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "QR23_007",

COMPANY POLICIES CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No mention rules for this user type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: This is an information query and does not involve any critical or destructive action.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: Functionality to search and resolve employees by name is available and used.

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The current user is in Human Resources and has rights to query employee information.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: The search resulted in an ambiguous match—two employees with the surname 'Bianchi'. The system needs more information (e.g., first name or role details) to determine which Bianchi is being referred to for the Wall and ceiling coating phase 2 project.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The task is clear, but more specification is needed to uniquely identify the intended employee.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: There was no technical/system error; the functionality executed as expected.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The search found matching employees ('Bianchi'), so the object exists, but it is ambiguous.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The ambiguity prevented the agent from providing the specific requested role; more information is needed first.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OUTCOME SELECTION

Priority order: functionality_not_available > permission_denied > more_info_needed > system_error > object_not_found > task_completed

Selected outcome: none_clarification_needed

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FINAL RESPONSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Outcome: none_clarification_needed
Message: There are two employees with the last name "Bianchi" in the system: Marco Bianchi (email: marco.bianchi@example.com) and Sofia Bianchi (email: sofia.bianchi@example.com). It is ambiguous which Bianchi is being referred to for the Wall and ceiling coating phase 2 project, as both have an equal match score of 0.70. Additional information is needed to determine the correct employee.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links
