Step 1: Identify the current user and their permissions using a who_am_i() style check, to understand what access Human Resources employee Armando Fontana (QR23_133) has regarding employee and project team membership data.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity and authorization service (who_am_i or equivalent) to retrieve the current authenticated user profile, including user identifier, department, location, and system roles (for example, Human Resources administrator, manager, Information Technology administrator). This step does not need project or employee context yet and only focuses on retrieving the current user metadata and role set that will later be used in a focused permission check. No additional actions are combined here.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
