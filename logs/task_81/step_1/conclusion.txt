I executed the step to identify the current user and their permissions. I called the `who_am_i()` function which returned the authenticated user context, and then retrieved the full employee record using `get_employee("QR23_133")` to examine all available fields.

The verified facts are:
- User ID: QR23_133 (Armando Fontana)
- Department: Human Resources (HR) 
- Location: HQ – Italy
- The employee record shows skills including "skill_progress_admin" and wills including "will_people_management", which indicate administrative and management capabilities

Regarding system roles: The available functions do not return an explicit `system_roles` field. The `who_am_i()` function returns a `WhoAmI` object without system roles, and the `get_employee()` function returns an `EmployeeFull` object that also doesn't include system roles. Based on the company rules and the user's HR department membership, HR employees typically have the 'HRAdmin' role for accessing employee data. However, this is an inference rather than an explicitly verified fact from function returns.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
