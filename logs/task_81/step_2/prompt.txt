Step 2: Find the employee record corresponding to the person referred to as "Bianchi" in the question, resolving their exact employee identifier in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table to search for any employees whose name field matches or contains "Bianchi". Start with exact match on full name and surname (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search, then fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for spelling mistakes and partial names, and finally semantic or logical interpretation if "Bianchi" could appear as part of a longer name (for example, "Luca Bianchi", "Bianchi Maria"). Ensure the search is FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL as required, and also consider that the term might appear in different name orderings or with accents. If multiple candidate employees are found, list them all with a match score so that the best match or an ambiguity can be determined without yet deciding on the final one in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_employee":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","candidates","selected_employee","ambiguous"]}
