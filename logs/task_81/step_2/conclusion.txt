STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

I have completed step 2 to find the employee record for "Bianchi". The verification process confirmed there are 2 employees with the last name "Bianchi" in the system, both with identical fuzzy match scores of 0.70. This creates an ambiguous situation where we cannot definitively select one employee without additional context.

The search process included:
1. Retrieving all 154 employees in the system
2. Searching for exact matches (none found)
3. Searching for substring matches (found 2 employees: Marco Bianchi and Sofia Bianchi)
4. Using fuzzy matching to calculate precise match scores (both scored 0.70)
5. Determining that with multiple equally strong matches, this is an ambiguous result

Both candidates are equally likely matches based on the name "Bianchi" alone. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
