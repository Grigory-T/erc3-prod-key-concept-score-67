Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
The step completed successfully in terms of retrieving the current user information. However, it was not possible to retrieve 'system_roles' for the user due to limitations in the available API functions. The original plan relies on knowing the user's system_roles to make an authorization decision in Step 2. Since system_roles cannot be determined, the next step (authorization check) cannot be performed strictly as designed, and subsequent steps (such as any that require authority validation) are also impacted. Therefore, the situation has changed and the plan for remaining steps needs to be reconsidered to account for the missing 'system_roles'. According to instruction, if a step does not produce the expected result or strange/unexpected results occur (like missing information or functions), we must replan the remaining steps.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:12:03
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous steps have been executed successfully and produced results as expected according to the original plan. Dragana Radovanović (employee ID: CjTb_122) has been positively identified using the required search approach. There have been no unexpected discrepancies, missing data, or function problems. The next step is to retrieve team/project memberships for this employee, which remains feasible. There is no need to replan or abort—the original plan is still valid and actionable.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:14:28
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All required data for step 4 has already been retrieved as part of the results from step 3: for each project membership of Dragana Radovanović, we have the project ID, name, status, customer, role, and time allocation. This matches exactly the information specified to be returned by step 4 according to the original plan. No further queries are necessary, and the full answer to the original task is available and complete.
