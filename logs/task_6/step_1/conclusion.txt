Successfully retrieved the current user's identity and security context using who_am_i() and get_employee. The user is Giovanni Rinaldi (employee ID: CjTb_001) from the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. However, the available API functions do not provide a "system_roles" field for the user. According to the company rules, authorization decisions are based on user.system_roles, but this information is not exposed through the current identity or employee data retrieval functions. Therefore, we cannot extract system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry with the provided mechanisms.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_001",
  "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
