Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Giovanni Rinaldi, employee id CjTb_001) and load their roles and permissions from the EmployeeRegistry, using a who_am_i() or equivalent mechanism.
Approach: Call the identity or session service (for example, who_am_i()) to retrieve the full security context for the current user based on employee_id CjTb_001. Do not log any data. Extract and return fields such as internal employee id, full name, department, location, and system_roles (for example: Executive Leadership, HRAdmin, DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin), ensuring this is derived from the authoritative EmployeeRegistry. This step is purely to understand what the user can access in later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
