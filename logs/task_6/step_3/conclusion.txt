Successfully retrieved all team/project memberships for Dragana Radovanović (employee ID: CjTb_122) by executing the step as instructed. The approach used was:

1. Used the exact employee_id "CjTb_122" from the previous step to query project memberships
2. Searched for all projects where this employee is a team member using `search_projects(team_employee="CjTb_122")` with pagination to ensure complete results
3. Retrieved full project details for each found project to extract the specific team membership information
4. Verified the team membership details including role and time allocation for each project
5. As an additional check, searched for time entries to identify any projects not in current team (none found)

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Found 2 projects where Dragana Radovanović is a team member
- Both projects have her in QA roles with specific time allocations (0.2 and 0.3)
- Project details (ID, name, status, customer) were explicitly printed from function returns
- No time entries were found for this employee

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used. No assumptions were made, and all data in the JSON response comes directly from the function outputs.
