We are going to search for projects where Dragana Radovanović (employee_id: CjTb_122) is a team member.

 We can use the search_projects function with the team_employee filter set to "CjTb_122".
 We should set include_archived to True to get all projects, but note that the task doesn't specify and we are just retrieving memberships.

 However, note that the search_projects function returns a list of ProjectBrief (with limited fields) and we might want to get more details.

 But the step says: "Retrieve all team/project memberships for the identified 'Radovanović Dragana' employee."

 So we want to list the projects she is involved in, and possibly her role and time_slice in each.

 However, the ProjectBrief does not contain team details. We can get the project details (including team) by calling get_project for each project.

 But note: the step does not require us to return the role and time_slice, but it is part of the membership.

 Alternatively, we can use the search_projects to get the list of projects and then for each project, get the full project to extract the team member information for this employee.

 However, the step says "team/project memberships", so we want to list the projects and her role in each.

 Let's break down:

 1. Use search_projects with team_employee="CjTb_122" to get the list of projects (briefs). We'll do this with pagination because the limit is 5.

 2. For each project, get the full project details (using get_project) to get the team list and find her specific team member record.

 3. Extract the relevant information: project id, name, her role, time_slice.

 But note: the search_projects function returns ProjectBrief, which doesn't have team. We must get the full project for each.

 However, we can also try to get all projects (using list_all_projects) and then filter by team membership? That might be inefficient if there are many projects.

 Since we are allowed to search by team_employee, let's use that.

 Steps:

 - We'll do paginated search until we get all projects that have this employee in the team.

 - For each project, we get the full project and then find the team member record for this employee.

 - We'll collect: project_id, project_name, role, time_slice.

 We must be cautious: the employee might be in multiple projects.

 Let's code accordingly.

 Also, note: the employee might not be in any project. In that case, we return an empty list.

 We are not required to change state, so we are safe.

 Let's start.

We are at Step 3 of the task: Retrieve all team/project memberships for the identified 'Radovanović Dragana' employee.
 We have already found the employee with ID CjTb_122 (Dragana Radovanović) in Step 2.

 Approach:
 We will search for projects where the employee CjTb_122 is a team member by using the search_projects function with the team_employee filter.
 We must also consider that the employee might be listed in projects with different roles or time allocations.

 Steps in code:
 1. Use search_projects(team_employee="CjTb_122") to get all projects where she is a team member.
 2. Since the search_projects function returns a paginated list, we need to handle pagination until no more projects are found.
 3. For each project found, we can get the full project details (including team) to extract her specific role and time allocation.

 However, note that the search_projects function with team_employee filter returns ProjectBrief objects, which do not include the team details.
 We need to get the full project details for each project to see the team information, specifically her role and time allocation.

 4. Alternatively, we can use the get_project function for each project ID to get the full team and then filter for CjTb_122.

 We are to return the team/project memberships. The expected output for this step is not specified in JSON format, but the step description says to retrieve all team/project memberships.

 Since the global task is "In which projects is Radovanović Dragana involved", we are to list the projects and her role in each.

 However, note that the current step (Step 3) is just to retrieve the memberships. The next step might be to format the answer.

 But for the current step, we will output the list of projects and her membership details.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll also consider that there might be no memberships, but in this case we found 2 projects.

 We'll output the following for each membership:
   - Project ID
   - Project name
   - Project status
   - Customer (ID) the project belongs to
   - Her role in the project
   - Her time allocation (time_slice)

 We'll store the results in a list of dictionaries.

 Also, note the company rules: we are only allowed to see non-sensitive information. Since we are in Corporate Leadership (executive), we have broad access, but we are only looking at project memberships, which should be okay.

 Let's code accordingly.

We are asked to verify that we have completed Step 3 correctly and that we have not missed anything.

We executed the step by:
1. Using the employee_id from Step 2 (CjTb_122) to search for projects where this employee is a team member.
2. We used the `search_projects` function with `team_employee="CjTb_122"` and retrieved all projects (including archived ones).
3. We then retrieved the full project details for each project to get the team information and extracted the specific team member record for CjTb_122.
4. We also checked for time entries to see if there were any projects that the employee worked on but is not currently a team member (none found).

We printed all the results and used only the data returned by the functions.

However, note that the step says: "If no memberships are found, optionally check for close/fuzzy matches on the employee_id field for possible mis-entry." We did find memberships, so we didn't need to do fuzzy matching on the employee_id.

We also did not change any state; we only performed read operations.

Now, let's double-check that we have indeed retrieved all team/project memberships. We used pagination to get all projects. We also checked time entries as an additional step, but the main approach was to search by team_employee.

We should also consider if there are any other ways an employee might be linked to a project (e.g., through a customer or other fields). However, the step specifically says "team_member/project link records", so the team_employee filter is correct.

We have 2 projects and we extracted the team membership details for each. The JSON we provided contains all the details we printed.

We did not make up any data. All values in the JSON are from the function returns.

Therefore, we are confident that we have completed Step 3.

We will now repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
