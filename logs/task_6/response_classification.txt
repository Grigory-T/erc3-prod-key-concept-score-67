# Current Context
Date: 2025-01-14
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_001
User details: {"id": "CjTb_001", "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Giovanni Rinaldi, employee id CjTb_001) and load their roles and permissions from the EmployeeRegistry, using a who_am_i() or equivalent mechanism.
Approach: Call the identity or session service (for example, who_am_i()) to retrieve the full security context for the current user based on employee_id CjTb_001. Do not log any data. Extract and return fields such as internal employee id, full name, department, location, and system_roles (for example: Executive Leadership, HRAdmin, DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin), ensuring this is derived from the authoritative EmployeeRegistry. This step is purely to understand what the user can access in later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** Successfully retrieved the current user's identity and security context using who_am_i() and get_employee. The user is Giovanni Rinaldi (employee ID: CjTb_001) from the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. However, the available API functions do not provide a "system_roles" field for the user. According to the company rules, authorization decisions are based on user.system_roles, but this information is not exposed through the current identity or employee data retrieval functions. Therefore, we cannot extract system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry with the provided mechanisms.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_001",
  "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the employee record for 'Radovanović Dragana' using a fuzzy and logical name search (allow for diacritics, inverted name order, partial/fuzzy matches).
Approach: Search the employee directory for an employee matching 'Radovanović Dragana', using normalized, partial, and fuzzy matching on both first and last name. Try both name orderings, allow for missing accents, and return candidates with match confidence. Only retrieve permitted non-sensitive fields: employee_id, name, email, location, department.
**Result:** Successfully located the employee record for 'Radovanović Dragana' using fuzzy and logical name search. The exact match was found with employee name "Dragana Radovanović" (employee ID: CjTb_122). Multiple search strategies were employed:
1. Fuzzy comparison showed a perfect match (ratio: 1.00) for the name order "Dragana Radovanović" and a partial match (ratio: 0.58) for the original order "Radovanović Dragana".
2. Direct search by query "Radovanović" and "Dragana" both returned exactly one result: Dragana Radovanović.
3. Verified the employee's non-sensitive fields by retrieving the full employee record.
No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used to locate the employee.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_122",
  "name": "Dragana Radovanović",
  "email": "CjTb_122@bellini.internal",
  "location": "Serbian Plant",
  "department": "Quality & HSE",
  "match_confidence": 1.0
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all team/project memberships for the identified 'Radovanović Dragana' employee.
Approach: Using the best_match_employee_id from the previous step, query for all team_member/project link records where the employee_id matches. If no memberships are found, optionally check for close/fuzzy matches on the employee_id field for possible mis-entry.
**Result:** Successfully retrieved all team/project memberships for Dragana Radovanović (employee ID: CjTb_122) by executing the step as instructed. The approach used was:

1. Used the exact employee_id "CjTb_122" from the previous step to query project memberships
2. Searched for all projects where this employee is a team member using `search_projects(team_employee="CjTb_122")` with pagination to ensure complete results
3. Retrieved full project details for each found project to extract the specific team membership information
4. Verified the team membership details including role and time allocation for each project
5. As an additional check, searched for time entries to identify any projects not in current team (none found)

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Found 2 projects where Dragana Radovanović is a team member
- Both projects have her in QA roles with specific time allocations (0.2 and 0.3)
- Project details (ID, name, status, customer) were explicitly printed from function returns
- No time entries were found for this employee

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used. No assumptions were made, and all data in the JSON response comes directly from the function outputs.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
