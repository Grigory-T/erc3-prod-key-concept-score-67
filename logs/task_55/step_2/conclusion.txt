I have successfully completed Step 2: Locate the employee record for the target person "Leone Bianca" in the EmployeeRegistry employee table. Following the approach outlined in the step description:

1. **Exact match attempt**: Searched for exact match of "Leone Bianca" - no match found
2. **Fuzzy and semantic searching**: 
   - Used fuzzy_compare which showed "Bianca Leone" with a ratio of 0.5
   - Tried reversed name "Bianca Leone" and found an exact match
   - Performed case-insensitive containment checks for both "Leone" and "Bianca"
   - Used search_employees API function with both variations
3. **Multiple candidates assessment**: Found two employees with "Leone" in name (Bianca Leone and Massimo Leone), but only one employee (Bianca Leone) has both "Leone" and "Bianca" in the name
4. **Best match selection**: Selected "Bianca Leone" (ID: BwFV_038) as the best match since it's the only employee containing both names

All facts were verified through function returns:
- Total employees: 154 (from list_all_employees())
- Exact match for "Bianca Leone": found employee ID BwFV_038
- Full employee details retrieved via get_employee("BwFV_038")
- Current salary: 73,000 (from employee.salary field)
- Other fields (email, location, department) extracted from the employee object

The search is not ambiguous as only one candidate (Bianca Leone) contains both names "Leone" and "Bianca". No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
