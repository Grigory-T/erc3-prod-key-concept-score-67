Step 2: Locate the employee record for the target person "Leone Bianca" in the EmployeeRegistry employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table in the EmployeeRegistry, first attempting an exact match on the name field with the full string "Leone Bianca". If no exact match is found, perform fuzzy and semantic or logical searching to account for possible misspellings, variations (for example, "Bianca Leone"), extra whitespace, or partial matches. This includes case-insensitive containment checks, partial word matches, and fuzzy text matching across relevant fields such as name, email, and id. If multiple candidates are found, select the best match based on fuzzy similarity scores; if still ambiguous, mark the result as ambiguous rather than guessing.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_name_query": {"type": "string"}, "matched": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}, "candidate_count": {"type": "integer"}, "employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_email": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "current_salary": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}, "location": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "department": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["target_name_query", "matched", "ambiguous", "candidate_count", "employee_id", "employee_name", "employee_email", "current_salary", "location", "department"]}
