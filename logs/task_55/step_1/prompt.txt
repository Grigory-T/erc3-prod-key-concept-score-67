Step 1: Retrieve the current authenticated user profile and authorization roles (who_am_i) to understand whether Ignazio Serra (user id BwFV_154) has any executive or salary-management related permissions.
Approach: Call the appropriate authentication or EmployeeRegistry identity endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the current session context. Extract user id, name, department, location, and system_roles. No fuzzy or semantic search is needed here because the current user is uniquely identified by the session, and field names are unambiguous.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["user_id", "user_name", "department", "location", "system_roles"]}
