Step 3: Check whether the current user has permission to access and modify the salary of the located employee (Leone Bianca), in line with the rule that only the employee themself or executive level users can access or change salary data.
Approach: Using the outputs from steps 1 and 2, compare the current user id with the target employee_id to see if they refer to the same person. Also examine system_roles and, if relevant, department (for example, membership in Executive Leadership or equivalent executive indicators) to determine whether the user is at executive level as required by the salary access policy. No fuzzy search is needed for identifiers and roles, but if role names or department labels are slightly inconsistent, apply fuzzy and semantic or logical matching to interpret them against known roles such as "Executive Leadership" or similar. Produce a clear boolean flag indicating whether salary modification is allowed, along with a textual explanation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "is_same_person": {"type": "boolean"}, "is_executive_level": {"type": "boolean"}, "can_modify_salary": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["user_id", "target_employee_id", "is_same_person", "is_executive_level", "can_modify_salary", "reason"]}
