I have reviewed the execution of Step 3 and confirm that all requirements were met:

1. **Step Execution**: I executed the exact step instruction to check permission for salary modification.

2. **No Skipped Actions**: 
   - Compared current user ID (BwFV_154) with target employee ID (BwFV_038) - verified through function returns
   - Examined user's department ("External") for executive indicators
   - Searched wiki for policy documentation about roles and permissions
   - Applied fuzzy matching between "External" and executive department terms
   - Retrieved and examined full employee record for both current user and target

3. **All Facts Verified**:
   - `is_same_person = False` (verified: "BwFV_154" ≠ "BwFV_038")
   - User department is "External" (from `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`)
   - Standard company departments from wiki: "Corporate Leadership", "Sales & Customer Success", "R&D and Technical Service", etc. (from `load_wiki("hr/people_and_roles.md")`)
   - "External" is not listed as a standard department in company documentation
   - Fuzzy matching ratios show low similarity (0.47, 0.38, 0.33) between "External" and executive terms
   - No evidence in wiki or employee records that "External" department has executive privileges

4. **Semantic/Logical Matching Applied**: Used fuzzy matching to check if "External" could semantically relate to executive roles (all ratios < 0.5).

5. **No State Changes**: No update functions were called in this step.

All values in the JSON response are explicitly verified from function returns. The conclusion that the user cannot modify salary is based on verified facts: user is not the target employee and their department "External" is not an executive department according to company documentation.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_154",
  "target_employee_id": "BwFV_038",
  "is_same_person": false,
  "is_executive_level": false,
  "can_modify_salary": false,
  "reason": "User is not the target employee (BwFV_154 ≠ BwFV_038) and department 'External' is not recognized as executive level according to company documentation and policy"
}
