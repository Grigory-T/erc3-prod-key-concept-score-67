DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:42:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The preceding step (Step 1) completed successfully and yielded relevant, correct results strictly following the original plan: the current user is identified as Ignazio Serra, department 'External', with no system roles. There is no discrepancy, and the expected output was produced according to the plan. The next step (Step 2) is feasible as designed and may proceed. No new constraints or unexpected results have occurred that would require replanning.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:47:11
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 were executed successfully as specified by the original plan, with all required factual data found: the current authenticated user was identified (Ignazio Serra, department 'External', no system roles), and the target employee 'Bianca Leone' (matching query 'Leone Bianca') was unambiguously located with a salary of 73,000. No unexpected or erroneous results have appeared, and the next step is feasible under the plan as written. The plan remains valid and should proceed to permission evaluation in Step 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:51:14
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
Step 3 has definitively established that the current user does NOT have permission to modify the salary of the target employee. The company policy requires the user to be either the affected employee or have executive-level privileges, neither of which are present. This is a mandatory, non-bypassable rule per the plan and company policy. Without permission, the subsequent steps of searching for update mechanisms or calculating the hypothetical new salary are irrelevant since no update action can ever be taken. As a result, the task cannot be completed by this user.
