Step 3: Retrieve all projects where Miguel Díaz is a team member (these constitute 'my projects').
Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 allow it, query the team_member table using the exact employee_id from Step 1 to find all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_id. Join these rows to the project table on project_id to get project details (id, name, status, customer_id, etc.). Since we are using the exact employee_id key, no fuzzy search is needed at this stage; however, if any project-related filtering by name or id becomes necessary, it should use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching with tolerance to typos and partial matches. Collect a deduplicated list of project records where Miguel appears in any role.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_id": { "type": "string" }, "project_name": { "type": "string" }, "project_status": { "type": "string" }, "customer_id": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["project_id", "project_name"] } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "projects"] }
