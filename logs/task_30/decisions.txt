DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:32:30
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed exactly as planned and produced the expected result: the authenticated user Miguel Díaz was resolved to a unique employee record with no ambiguity. There are no errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected results. The next step in the plan is to check permissions for viewing own projects and their teams, which is standard and required before making data queries. Company policies and the plan both allow for continuation.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:36:02
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is proceeding according to the original plan and each step has produced the expected results. Steps 1 and 2 are complete, and permissions are in place for Miguel Díaz to view his projects and their team members. There are no inconsistencies or unexpected issues. The next step is to retrieve all projects where Miguel Díaz is a team member. The plan remains valid and achievable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:37:21
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have succeeded exactly as specified in the Original Plan. The correct employee id ('iv5n_029') is confirmed for Miguel Díaz, permissions are validated, and the relevant projects have been fetched with full data and no ambiguity. There were no errors, access issues, or missing data. The next step in the plan is to check each project for designer roles and aggregate results, which is feasible and aligns exactly with the stated plan. No new constraints or unexpected results require replanning or aborting the task. Proceeding to the next step is the correct and policy-compliant path.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:39:19
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
Step 4 produced clear, definitive results: none of Miguel Díaz's projects have a designer on the team, as confirmed by exact and fuzzy role lookups. The next step is to prepare and return the final answer with this information. This matches the intent and output structure of Step 5 as described in the Original Plan.
