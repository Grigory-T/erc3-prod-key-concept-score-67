Step 4 completed and verified. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified: for each project retrieved in Step 3, I determined whether there is at least one team member with role 'Designer'. 

I performed multiple verification checks:
1. Direct project retrieval with exact role matching (case-sensitive)
2. Case-insensitive checking for designer roles and design-related terms
3. Search for projects where Miguel has the Designer role (none found)
4. List all unique roles across both projects to identify any variations

Verification results: No designer roles found in either project. All unique roles across both projects are: ['Engineer', 'Lead', 'Ops', 'QA']. None of these are designer roles or variations.

No assumptions were made - all facts were verified through function returns. No state-changing operations were performed.
