## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current employee record for the authenticated user Miguel Díaz (user id 'iv5n_029') in the employee registry, to know which employee_id to use when searching for 'my projects'.
Approach: Use the session-bound identity (who_am_i-style lookup) to retrieve the corresponding employee.id for the current user 'iv5n_029'. If the backend does not directly expose the employee_id, query the employee table using the user's known attributes (for example, name = 'Miguel Díaz', and, if available, email) with an exact match first. If no exact match is found or there is ambiguity, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching on name (handling accents, case, whitespace, and possible typos) to find the best matching employee record. Do not proceed if multiple employee candidates remain ambiguous.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_system_id": { "type": "string" }, "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "employee_name": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" }, "found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["user_system_id", "found", "ambiguous"] }
**Result:** The step has been completed successfully. I executed the exact approach specified: first used the session-bound identity from who_am_i() to get the current_user ID ('iv5n_029'), then performed an exact match lookup in the employee registry using get_employee('iv5n_029'). The employee was found with matching name "Miguel Díaz" and all attributes (location, department) match the user context. No fuzzy or semantic searching was needed as the exact match was successful. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_system_id": "iv5n_029",
  "employee_id": "iv5n_029",
  "employee_name": "Miguel Díaz",
  "match_confidence": 1.0,
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee (Miguel Díaz) to confirm he can view his own projects and their team compositions (including roles such as Designer).
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 1 and the system-bound roles/permissions for the current user, evaluate whether reading project and team_member data for projects that include this employee is allowed. Consult any internal authorization rules or services (for example, an access control list or role-based access control service). This is a read-only query; verify that no special project visibility constraints apply. If the system exposes an authorization API, call it once the employee_id is known. If permissions are denied, stop further steps.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "can_view_own_projects": { "type": "boolean" }, "can_view_team_members_on_own_projects": { "type": "boolean" }, "denied_reason": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "can_view_own_projects", "can_view_team_members_on_own_projects"] }
**Result:** Permissions check completed. Miguel Díaz can view his own projects and their team member details including roles. No access restrictions were encountered during the verification process. The system allowed successful retrieval of project data and team member details with visible roles for projects where the employee is a team member.

{
  "employee_id": "iv5n_029",
  "can_view_own_projects": true,
  "can_view_team_members_on_own_projects": true,
  "denied_reason": null
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all projects where Miguel Díaz is a team member (these constitute 'my projects').
Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 allow it, query the team_member table using the exact employee_id from Step 1 to find all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_id. Join these rows to the project table on project_id to get project details (id, name, status, customer_id, etc.). Since we are using the exact employee_id key, no fuzzy search is needed at this stage; however, if any project-related filtering by name or id becomes necessary, it should use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching with tolerance to typos and partial matches. Collect a deduplicated list of project records where Miguel appears in any role.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_id": { "type": "string" }, "project_name": { "type": "string" }, "project_status": { "type": "string" }, "customer_id": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["project_id", "project_name"] } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "projects"] }
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 3. Retrieved all projects where Miguel Díaz (iv5n_029) is a team member by querying with the exact employee_id. Found 2 projects with all required details. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "iv5n_029",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_centralsteel_galvanised_touchup",
      "project_name": "Galvanised steel touch-up system",
      "project_status": "exploring",
      "customer_id": "cust_centralsteel_engineering"
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint",
      "project_name": "Port crane repainting specification",
      "project_status": "exploring",
      "customer_id": "cust_adriatic_marine_services"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: For each project retrieved in Step 3, determine whether there is at least one team member with role 'Designer'.
Approach: Using the list of project_ids from Step 3, query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id is in that set and team_member.role = 'Designer' (exact match to the enumerated role). If the underlying data might contain minor inconsistencies (for example, 'designer', 'DESIGNER'), normalize case in the query or post-processing and, if necessary, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching limited to clear designer-role synonyms. Group the results by project_id, capturing the list of designer team members (employee_id and role) per project and a boolean flag indicating whether a designer is present.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "projects_with_role_info": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_id": { "type": "string" }, "has_designer": { "type": "boolean" }, "designers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "role": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "role"] } } }, "required": ["project_id", "has_designer"] } } }, "required": ["projects_with_role_info"] }
**Result:** Step 4 completed and verified. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified: for each project retrieved in Step 3, I determined whether there is at least one team member with role 'Designer'. 

I performed multiple verification checks:
1. Direct project retrieval with exact role matching (case-sensitive)
2. Case-insensitive checking for designer roles and design-related terms
3. Search for projects where Miguel has the Designer role (none found)
4. List all unique roles across both projects to identify any variations

Verification results: No designer roles found in either project. All unique roles across both projects are: ['Engineer', 'Lead', 'Ops', 'QA']. None of these are designer roles or variations.

No assumptions were made - all facts were verified through function returns. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "projects_with_role_info": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_centralsteel_galvanised_touchup",
      "has_designer": false,
      "designers": []

    {
      "project_id": "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint",
      "has_designer": false,
      "designers": []
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
None of your projects currently have a designer on the team. I checked all team member roles for your projects ('Galvanised steel touch-up system' and 'Port crane repainting specification') and found no designers or any design-related roles among them.

CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: No data deletion or critical action was requested; this is a data query.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: All required project/team member query functionality is available; the agent executed all necessary queries.

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user has permission to view their own projects and all relevant team member roles, as confirmed by Step 2.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: All information required to complete the task (user's identity, project list) was available; no further info is needed.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The task was clear: determine which of the user's projects includes a team member with the role 'Designer'.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: No technical error occurred; the system processed all steps successfully.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The agent found the employee and projects, but found no designer role among team members. There were, however, projects present, so 'object_not_found' (project/team member) does not apply.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: All steps for querying the user's projects and identifying if any had a designer on the team were executed successfully, yielding a concrete and verified negative answer.

**Result:** The step has been completed successfully. I executed the exact approach specified: first used the session-bound identity from who_am_i() to get the current_user ID ('iv5n_029'), then performed an exact match lookup in the employee registry using get_employee('iv5n_029'). The employee was found with matching name "Miguel Díaz" and all attributes (location, department) match the user context. No fuzzy or semantic searching was needed as the exact match was successful.

}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all projects where Miguel Díaz is a team member (these constitute 'my projects').
Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 allow it, query the team_member table using the exact employee_id from Step 1 to find all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_id.

}

### Step 4
Step 4: For each project retrieved in Step 3, determine whether there is at least one team member with role 'Designer'.
Approach: Using the list of project_ids from Step 3, query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id is in that set and team_member.role = 'Designer' (exact match to the enumerated role). If the underlying data might contain minor inconsistencies (for example, 'designer', 'DESIGNER'), normalize case in the query or post-processing and, if necessary, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching limited to clear designer-role synonyms.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
