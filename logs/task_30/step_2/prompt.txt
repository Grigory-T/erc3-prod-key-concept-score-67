Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee (Miguel Díaz) to confirm he can view his own projects and their team compositions (including roles such as Designer).
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 1 and the system-bound roles/permissions for the current user, evaluate whether reading project and team_member data for projects that include this employee is allowed. Consult any internal authorization rules or services (for example, an access control list or role-based access control service). This is a read-only query; verify that no special project visibility constraints apply. If the system exposes an authorization API, call it once the employee_id is known. If permissions are denied, stop further steps.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "can_view_own_projects": { "type": "boolean" }, "can_view_team_members_on_own_projects": { "type": "boolean" }, "denied_reason": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "can_view_own_projects", "can_view_team_members_on_own_projects"] }
