The step has been completed successfully. I executed the exact approach specified: first used the session-bound identity from who_am_i() to get the current_user ID ('iv5n_029'), then performed an exact match lookup in the employee registry using get_employee('iv5n_029'). The employee was found with matching name "Miguel Díaz" and all attributes (location, department) match the user context. No fuzzy or semantic searching was needed as the exact match was successful. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_system_id": "iv5n_029",
  "employee_id": "iv5n_029",
  "employee_name": "Miguel Díaz",
  "match_confidence": 1.0,
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false
}
