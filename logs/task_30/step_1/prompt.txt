Step 1: Identify the current employee record for the authenticated user Miguel Díaz (user id 'iv5n_029') in the employee registry, to know which employee_id to use when searching for 'my projects'.
Approach: Use the session-bound identity (who_am_i-style lookup) to retrieve the corresponding employee.id for the current user 'iv5n_029'. If the backend does not directly expose the employee_id, query the employee table using the user's known attributes (for example, name = 'Miguel Díaz', and, if available, email) with an exact match first. If no exact match is found or there is ambiguity, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching on name (handling accents, case, whitespace, and possible typos) to find the best matching employee record. Do not proceed if multiple employee candidates remain ambiguous.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_system_id": { "type": "string" }, "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "employee_name": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" }, "found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["user_system_id", "found", "ambiguous"] }
