Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema used to store employees, locations, and will-type entries (motivation/interest such as mentoring) in production systems.
Approach: Inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog of the core systems using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for tables and entities related to employees, locations, and skills/wills (for example searching for names similar to "employee", "employees", "employee_skill", "employee_will", "location"). Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location. Also confirm the exact column names needed for later queries.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_table": {"type": "string"}, "employee_skill_table": {"type": "string"}, "location_table": {"type": "string"}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_table", "employee_skill_table", "location_table", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
