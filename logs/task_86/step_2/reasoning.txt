We are on Step 2. The step description: "Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema used to store employees, locations, and will-type entries (motivation/interest such as mentoring) in production systems."

 We are to use fuzzy and semantic/logical search for tables and entities related to employees, locations, and skills/wills.

 However, note the available functions: we have functions to access employee data (get_employee, list_employees, etc.) but not direct database tables.

 The step says: "Inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog of the core systems" and then "Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, ..."

 But note: the available functions do not include direct database queries. We have to rely on the provided functions and the wiki.

 The wiki might contain schema information. Let's search the wiki for terms like "employee table", "employee_skill", "location table", etc.

 We also have fuzzy search functions for the wiki.

 Approach:

 1. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` to search for words related to the schema, tables, and columns.

 2. We are looking for:
    - The employee table: perhaps "employee", "employees", "employee_registry"
    - The employee_skill table: "employee_skill", "skill", "will"
    - The location table: "location"

 3. We must confirm that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`.

 4. We need to output the exact table names and a boolean indicating if we confirmed the will representation.

 Since the available functions are abstracted, we don't have direct database access. However, we can use the wiki to find documentation about the data model.

 Let's search the wiki with a list of target words:

 We'll use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of words: ["employee", "skill", "will", "location", "table", "schema"].

 But note: the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` takes a list of words and returns fuzzy matches in the wiki.

 We'll also try to load known wiki files that might contain data dictionary, e.g., "data_dictionary.md", "schema.md", etc.

 We can list the wiki files first and then load the ones that seem relevant.

 However, the step says to use fuzzy and semantic search. We'll do both:

  - List wiki files and look for ones with relevant names.
  - Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` to search for the terms.

 Let's start by listing the wiki files.

 We'll write Python code to:

  1. List the wiki files.
  2. Search the wiki for the relevant terms.
  3. From the results, try to determine the table names and confirm the will representation.

 Note: The expected output requires specific keys: employee_table, employee_skill_table, location_table, will_representation_confirmed.

 We must set:

   employee_table: string, e.g., "employee"
   employee_skill_table: string, e.g., "employee_skill"
   location_table: string, e.g., "location"
   will_representation_confirmed: boolean (true if we found evidence that wills are stored in employee_skill with skill_type='will')

 We'll do:

  - Search for "employee" and "table" to find the employee table name.
  - Search for "skill" and "will" to find the employee_skill table and how wills are stored.

 Let's execute.

[REASONING #9] 2025-12-10 00:06:13
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog. We have wiki files, and one of them is likely to contain technical schema information.
 Let's look at the systems documentation, especially "systems/employee_registry.md" and "systems/overview.md", which might describe the underlying tables.
 We'll also check "systems/crm.md" and "systems/project_registry.md" for their respective systems.

 Since the task is about employee, location, and will-type entries, let's focus on the employee registry documentation.

 We are looking for:
 - employee_table: the table storing employee records
 - employee_skill_table: the table storing skill/will entries (if separate)
 - location_table: the table storing location data (or is it a field in employee table?)

 Also, we need to confirm if wills are stored in the same table as skills (with a type field) or separately.

 Let's load the employee_registry.md file and search for table names.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #10] 2025-12-10 00:07:40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in Step 2 of the task. The goal is to identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema used to store employees, locations, and will-type entries (motivation/interest such as mentoring) in production systems.

From the previous step, we have determined:
- Serbian plant location name: "Serbian Plant"
- Mentoring will keywords: "Interest in mentoring junior sales", "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems"
- Strong motivation level threshold: 7

Now, we need to inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog of the core systems. We are to use fuzzy and semantic search for tables and entities related to employees, locations, and skills/wills.

We have already done extensive searching in the wiki and found:
1. The employee registry is the system that stores employee data, including skills and wills.
2. Skills and wills are stored as lists of `SkillLevel` objects in the employee registry.
3. The company uses legacy systems built on Progress OpenEdge.

However, we need to confirm the exact table names and column names. The documentation in the wiki does not seem to contain explicit CREATE TABLE statements or detailed database schema.

Let's re-examine the available information and make inferences based on the available functions and data structures.

From the available functions, we have:
- `get_employee` returns an `EmployeeFull` object, which has fields: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills (list of SkillLevel), wills (list of SkillLevel).
- The `SkillLevel` object has `name` and `level`.

The documentation in `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` states:
- Skills and wills are represented as **lists of `SkillLevel` objects** in the employee registry and are always stored **sorted alphabetically by name**.

The `systems/employee_registry.md` states:
- What is stored: employee ID, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills (list of SkillLevel), wills (list of SkillLevel).

Given the above, it seems that the employee registry is a single table (or entity) that stores all employee information, including the skills and wills as nested structures (or perhaps a separate table in a 1-to-many relationship).

However, the step asks for:
- employee_table: the table name for employees
- employee_skill_table: the table name for the skills (and wills) association
- location_table: the table name for locations
- will_representation_confirmed: boolean indicating if wills are stored with a skill_type = 'will' or similar.

Since we don't have explicit table names in the wiki, we might need to infer from the context or use the available functions to understand the underlying structure.

Looking at the function `update_employee_info`, we note that it updates the entire employee record, including skills and wills. This suggests that the skills and wills are stored as part of the employee record, possibly in a nested format (like JSON or as a separate table but updated via the same function).

Alternatively, the system might use a NoSQL approach or an object-oriented database (Progress OpenEdge can be used in both relational and object-oriented ways).

Given the lack of explicit schema documentation in the wiki, we might have to rely on the function signatures and data structures we have.

Let's consider the following:
1. The employee registry is likely a table named `employee` or `employees`.
2. The skills and wills are stored in a separate table `employee_skill` (or `employee_will`) that links to the employee table and has a field to distinguish between skill and will (like `skill_type`).
3. The location is likely a field in the employee table (as we see in the EmployeeFull object).

However, we cannot be sure without more evidence. Let's search for any mention of "employee_skill" or "skill_type" in the wiki.

We'll do a more targeted search:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #11] 2025-12-10 00:08:20
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I need to provide the final answer for Step 2. The task is to identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema. Based on my analysis, I have:

1. Employee data is stored in a table, likely named 'employee' or similar. The evidence: EmployeeFull model fields match typical table columns.
2. Skills and wills are stored in a separate table, likely 'employee_skill' or similar. They use the same SkillLevel structure. However, I didn't find explicit evidence of a 'skill_type' column to distinguish skills from wills, but the system treats them separately.
3. Location is not a separate table; it's a string field in the employee table.
4. Will representation: I didn't find confirmation that there is a 'skill_type = 'will'' column. The system separates skills and wills at the application level, but the underlying storage might be the same table with a type field.

Given the instructions to "confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location."

I haven't found explicit confirmation of a separate location table or a skill_type column. The documentation doesn't provide CREATE TABLE statements. However, from the data models and functions, I can infer the likely schema.

For the expected output, I need to provide:
- employee_table: string
- employee_skill_table: string  
- location_table: string (or null if not separate)
- will_representation_confirmed: boolean

Based on my analysis:
- employee_table: "employee" (assumed)
- employee_skill_table: "employee_skill" (assumed)
- location_table: null (since location is a field, not a separate table)
- will_representation_confirmed: false (no evidence of skill_type='will')

But wait, the expected output requires all properties. I should state what I found, not assume. The wiki doesn't explicitly name tables. However, the step says "Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema used to store employees, locations, and will-type entries... Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table..." So I need to confirm if that is true.

I didn't find explicit confirmation, but from the context, it's reasonable to assume the table names are as described. The location table might not exist. The will representation: I saw in the skills_and_wills_model.md that both are stored as SkillLevel objects, but no mention of a 'skill_type' field.

Let me double-check the skills_and_wills_model.md content for any mention of a type field.

I'll load it again and search for "type" or "skill_type".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #12] 2025-12-10 00:09:09
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are to determine the schema based on the available information. We have searched the wiki and found no explicit CREATE TABLE statements. However, by analyzing the data structures and function signatures, we can infer the following:

1. The employee registry stores employee data. The EmployeeFull model includes fields: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills (list of SkillLevel), wills (list of SkillLevel). This suggests that the employee table (or equivalent) has columns for these fields, with skills and wills stored in a related table.

2. The update_employee_info function takes separate lists for skills and wills, each as a list of dicts with 'name' and 'level'. This suggests that there is a table (or tables) for employee skills and wills, possibly with a type field to distinguish between skill and will.

3. The location is stored as a string in the employee table, and there is no evidence of a separate location table.

4. We have found no explicit mention of a 'skill_type' field in the wiki, but the system does distinguish between skills and wills in the data model (separate lists). Therefore, we cannot confirm the presence of a 'skill_type' field set to 'will' for wills.

Given the above, we must provide the expected output:

- employee_table: the table storing employee core data (like 'employee')
- employee_skill_table: the table storing skills and wills (like 'employee_skill')
- location_table: since location is a string field in employee, there is no separate location table. We set this to an empty string or null? The expected output is a string, so we must decide.

The expected output requires:
  - employee_table (string)
  - employee_skill_table (string)
  - location_table (string)
  - will_representation_confirmed (boolean)

We have to make our best guess based on the available information.

From the analysis:
  - The employee table is likely called "employee" (or "employees").
  - The employee_skill table is likely called "employee_skill" (or "employee_skill_will").
  - There is no separate location table, so we set location_table to an empty string? But the expected output is a string, so we can set it to "" or a guess like "location" if we think there is one. However, we found no evidence of a separate location table.

We have to decide on will_representation_confirmed. The step description says: "Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`". We have not found evidence of a `skill_type` field. Therefore, we cannot confirm this representation.

Let's check the output of the previous step: we were to look for "skill_type = 'will'". We didn't find it. So we set will_representation_confirmed to False.

However, note that the system does store wills and skills separately in the model, so there must be a way to distinguish them. It could be that there are two separate tables (one for skills and one for wills) or a type field. Without explicit documentation, we cannot confirm the exact representation.

Given the instructions, we must base our answer on what we found (or didn't find). We did not find explicit schema definitions. We are allowed to infer from the data structures and function signatures.

Let's formulate the answer:

- employee_table: We'll say "employee" (based on common naming)
- employee_skill_table: We'll say "employee_skill" (or "employee_skill_will"? The step description says "employee_skill", so we'll use that)
- location_table: We found no evidence, so we'll set to an empty string? But the expected output is a string, so we must provide a string. Alternatively, we can note that location is a field in the employee table, so there is no separate table. We can set location_table to "" or "None". However, the example output in the step description does not specify what to do if there is no table. We'll set it to an empty string.

- will_representation_confirmed: We did not find evidence of a skill_type field, so we set to False.

But wait, the step says: "Confirm that ... motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`". We have not confirmed that. So we set will_representation_confirmed to False.

However, note that the update_employee_info function takes separate lists for skills and wills. This could imply two separate tables or a single table with a type field. Without explicit documentation, we cannot confirm.

We'll output:

{
  "employee_table": "employee",
  "employee_skill_table": "employee_skill",
  "location_table": "",
  "will_representation_confirmed": false
}

But let's double-check: in the available functions, we have search_employees that can filter by location (as a string). This suggests that location is a field in the employee table, not a separate table.

We also note that in the example employee profiles, the location is a string like "Serbian Plant". There is no indication of a location table.

Therefore, we set location_table to an empty string.

Alternatively, the system might have a location table for reference data, but we have no evidence. We'll go with no table.

Given the above, we'll produce the final answer.

[REASONING #13] 2025-12-10 00:10:13

The user asks for verification of my previous conclusion. I need to re-examine whether I have fully executed the step as instructed. The step says: "Inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog of the core systems using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for tables and entities related to employees, locations, and skills/wills ... Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location. Also confirm the exact column names needed for later queries."

I did search the wiki using fuzzy and regex searches. I did not find explicit CREATE TABLE statements or a data dictionary. I inferred schema from data models and function signatures. However, the step expects confirmation of specific details: that employee table is named `employee`, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that location is a separate table referenced by employee.location.

My findings: 
- From the data models, location is a string field in EmployeeFull, not a foreign key. So likely no separate location table. 
- I did not find confirmation of `skill_type = 'will'`. The documentation says skills and wills are both stored as SkillLevel objects, but not how they are distinguished in the database.

Maybe I missed searching for "skill_type" or "type" in the wiki. I did a search for "skill_type" but found none. Let me double-check by searching for "skill_type" and "type" more broadly.

Also, I should consider that the step asks to confirm "exact column names needed for later queries." I didn't identify column names. However, the expected output only asks for table names and a boolean about will representation. So column names are not required in output.

But I need to ensure I used fuzzy and semantic search adequately. I did use regex and fuzzy search on wiki. Perhaps I should also search for terms like "employee_skill" directly.

Let me run a quick additional search:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #14] 2025-12-10 00:11:10
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the verification, I need to accurately report what was found versus what was requested.
 The step asks to "confirm" table names and will representation, but no explicit table names or skill_type='will' field were found in documentation.
 However, from the data structures and function signatures, I can infer the likely schema.
 The expected output requires specific strings for table names and a boolean for will_representation_confirmed.

 Since the documentation does not explicitly state table names, I cannot "confirm" the exact table names as per the step's expectation.
 But I must provide the required JSON. The step says: "Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, ..."
 We did not find such confirmation. However, the step's approach says to use fuzzy and semantic search.

 We have performed extensive searches and found no explicit table names. The only concrete evidence is:
   - The system uses Progress OpenEdge.
   - Skills and wills are stored as lists of SkillLevel objects in the employee registry (per skills_and_wills_model.md).
   - Location is a string field in the employee record (from the data model).

 Therefore, for the JSON output, I must base it on what we actually found (or didn't find).

 Let me re-read the step: "Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema ... Confirm that ..."

 Since we cannot confirm the exact table names, we have to report what we know.

 However, note that the expected output requires a string for location_table. If there is no separate location table, what should we put?

 The step says: "physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location."

 But our investigation shows location is a string in the employee table, not a separate table.

 Given the evidence, I must conclude:
   - employee_table: We don't know the exact table name, but the employee data is stored in a table. We can assume 'employee' as the most likely.
   - employee_skill_table: We don't know the exact table name, but skills and wills are stored in the employee registry as SkillLevel objects. 
   - location_table: There is no separate location table; location is a field in the employee table.
   - will_representation_confirmed: We found no evidence of a skill_type='will' field. However, the documentation says wills are stored as SkillLevel objects, same as skills, but interpreted differently.

 Let me check the skills_and_wills_model.md again for the exact wording on how wills are stored.

 From the output above, Line 13: "Also stored as a `SkillLevel`, but interpreted as motivation rather than demonstrated ability."

 This indicates that wills are stored in the same structure (SkillLevel) but with a different interpretation. There is no mention of a type field.

 Therefore, will_representation_confirmed should be false because we cannot confirm a skill_type='will' field.

 For the table names, since we cannot confirm exact names, we must use the most likely names based on common conventions and the context.

 However, the step requires that we "confirm" the table names. Since we did not find explicit confirmation, we cannot state the table names with certainty.

 But note: the step's approach says to use fuzzy and semantic search. We have done that and found no matches.

 What to do?

 Let me look at the expected output: it requires strings for the table names. We must provide something.

 Since we have no explicit table names, we can only provide empty strings or the most likely names.

 However, the instructions say: "JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns."

 We have not verified any table names. Therefore, we cannot provide any string that we have verified.

 This is a dilemma. Let me re-examine the step instruction: "Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema"

 We have identified the data sources (employee registry, etc.) and the schema (location as string, skills and wills as SkillLevel objects). We have not confirmed the table names.

 So, for the table names, we cannot provide verified strings. We can only note that we didn't find them.

 However, the expected output requires strings. I think we must provide the most reasonable strings based on the context, but note in the final answer that they are inferred.

 But the instruction says: "Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below)."

 We have no function returns that give table names.

 Therefore, I think the only honest response is to use empty strings for table names we cannot confirm, and false for will_representation_confirmed.

 However, the step says to "confirm that ... stored in the `employee` table". We cannot confirm that, so we cannot set employee_table to "employee".

 Let me check if there is any function that might return table names? No, the available functions are for data, not schema.

 Given this, I think we must report that we could not confirm the table names.

 But the step requires the JSON. Let me see the expected output again:

 Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_table": {"type": "string"}, "employee_skill_table": {"type": "string"}, "location_table": {"type": "string"}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_table", "employee_skill_table", "location_table", "will_representation_confirmed"]}

 We must provide a string for each table. Since we cannot confirm, we can provide empty strings.

 However, note that the step says: "Also confirm the exact column names needed for later queries." We haven't done that either.

 Given the time, I think we must provide:

   employee_table: "" (empty string) because we cannot confirm.
   employee_skill_table: "" (empty string) because we cannot confirm.
   location_table: "" (empty string) because we found no separate location table.
   will_representation_confirmed: false (because we found no evidence of skill_type='will')

 But wait: the step says "physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location."

 We found that location is a string in the employee table, not a separate table. So we cannot confirm a location table.

 However, the expected output requires a string for location_table. We can put an empty string.

 Alternatively, we can put "employee" for location_table? No, because the step says it's a separate table.

 I think the correct response is to report what we found.

 Let me check the step again: "Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location."

 We have not confirmed any of these three points.

 Therefore, in the JSON, we set:
   employee_table: "" (not confirmed)
   employee_skill_table: "" (not confirmed) 
   location_table: "" (not confirmed, and we found evidence against a separate table)
   will_representation_confirmed: false (not confirmed)

 But note: the step asks to "confirm". We have not confirmed, so we set to empty strings and false.

 However, the step also says: "Also confirm the exact column names needed for later queries." We haven't done that.

 I think we have to accept that we cannot confirm the schema as described in the step. We must report what we actually found.

 Let me write the final answer accordingly.
