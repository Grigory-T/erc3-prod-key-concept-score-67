After exhaustive searching through company documentation, I have been unable to confirm the exact table names or database schema details as requested in the step. The documentation does not contain explicit references to database table names like "employee", "employee_skill", or a separate "location" table. While I can infer that employee data is stored in some form of employee registry and that skills/wills use a SkillLevel structure, I cannot verify the specific table names or confirm that wills are stored with a `skill_type = 'will'` field.

Key findings from the search:
1. No CREATE TABLE statements or explicit database schema documentation exists in the wiki
2. No references to "employee", "employee_skill", or "location" as database tables were found
3. Location appears to be stored as a string field within employee records, not as a separate table
4. Skills and wills are both stored as SkillLevel objects in the employee registry
5. The system uses Progress OpenEdge legacy systems, but no detailed schema is documented

Since the step requires confirmation of specific table names and schema details that are not documented, I cannot provide verified values for the table names or confirm the will representation as described.

{
  "employee_table": "",
  "employee_skill_table": "",
  "location_table": "",
  "will_representation_confirmed": false
}
