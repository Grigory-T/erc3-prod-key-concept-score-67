I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. After examining the embedded will entries of all 29 Serbian Plant employees:

1. **Exact String Matching**: No employee has will entries with the exact names 'Interest in mentoring junior sales' or 'Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems' as specified in Step 1.

2. **Semantic Matching**: The closest matching will name in the system is `will_mentor_juniors`, which semantically relates to mentoring junior staff. However, this does not exactly match the specified strings.

3. **Threshold Check**: Even when considering `will_mentor_juniors` as a semantic match, no employee has this will at level 7 or higher (the strong motivation threshold). The highest level observed was 6.

Therefore, the filtered list of Serbian Plant employees with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff (as indicated by will entries matching the specified strings with level ≥7) is empty.
