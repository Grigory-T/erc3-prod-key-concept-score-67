# Company: Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
Locations: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria
Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-03
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001
User details: {"id": "QR23_001", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** List employees in Serbian Plant with strong motivation Interest in mentoring junior staff.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand internal terminology and data mapping for "Serbian Plant" and for motivation / interest in mentoring junior staff by consulting internal documentation or wiki.
Approach: Use company wiki or internal documentation search (search_wiki_fuzzy or equivalent) with **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms such as "Serbian plant", "Serbian factory", "Novi Sad site", "Serbia location", and for people development concepts like "mentoring juniors", "coaching junior staff", "mentoring will", "interest in mentoring". Account for typos, misspellings, pluralization, and alternative phrasings. From the results, determine which location.name values or standard labels correspond to the Serbian factory near Novi Sad, and identify standard will/skill names or tags used to record interest in mentoring junior staff, as well as what level (for example 4 or 5) is considered a "strong" motivation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"serbian_plant_location_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "mentoring_will_keywords": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_motivation_level_threshold": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["serbian_plant_location_names", "mentoring_will_keywords", "strong_motivation_level_threshold"]}
**Result:** I have successfully consulted the company wiki and internal documentation to understand the internal terminology for Serbian plant locations and mentoring interest levels. The analysis reveals:

1. **Serbian Plant Location Names**: The standard location field value for employees at the Serbian factory near Novi Sad is consistently "Serbian Plant" in the employee registry. This is confirmed both in the wiki documentation (company/locations_and_sites.md) and in actual employee data.

2. **Mentoring Will Keywords**: The system uses specific will names to record interest in mentoring junior staff. Based on example employee profiles, the exact will names are "Interest in mentoring junior sales" and "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems". These represent different aspects of mentoring interest.

3. **Strong Motivation Level Threshold**: According to the skills_and_wills_model.md documentation, the company uses a 1-10 rating scale where levels 7-8 are defined as "Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation". Therefore, the threshold for "strong motivation" is level 7.

These findings provide the necessary data mapping for the next step of identifying employees in the Serbian plant with strong motivation interest in mentoring junior staff.

{
  "serbian_plant_location_names": ["Serbian Plant"],
  "mentoring_will_keywords": ["Interest in mentoring junior sales", "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems"],
  "strong_motivation_level_threshold": 7
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema used to store employees, locations, and will-type entries (motivation/interest such as mentoring) in production systems.
Approach: Inspect the data dictionary or schema catalog of the core systems using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for tables and entities related to employees, locations, and skills/wills (for example searching for names similar to "employee", "employees", "employee_skill", "employee_will", "location"). Confirm that the employee information is stored in the `employee` table, that motivation/interest entries are stored in `employee_skill` with `skill_type = 'will'`, and that physical sites like the Serbian plant are represented via the `location` table referenced by employee.location. Also confirm the exact column names needed for later queries.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_table": {"type": "string"}, "employee_skill_table": {"type": "string"}, "location_table": {"type": "string"}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_table", "employee_skill_table", "location_table", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
**Result:** After exhaustive searching through company documentation, I have been unable to confirm the exact table names or database schema details as requested in the step. The documentation does not contain explicit references to database table names like "employee", "employee_skill", or a separate "location" table. While I can infer that employee data is stored in some form of employee registry and that skills/wills use a SkillLevel structure, I cannot verify the specific table names or confirm that wills are stored with a `skill_type = 'will'` field.

Key findings from the search:
1. No CREATE TABLE statements or explicit database schema documentation exists in the wiki
2. No references to "employee", "employee_skill", or "location" as database tables were found
3. Location appears to be stored as a string field within employee records, not as a separate table
4. Skills and wills are both stored as SkillLevel objects in the employee registry
5. The system uses Progress OpenEdge legacy systems, but no detailed schema is documented

Since the step requires confirmation of specific table names and schema details that are not documented, I cannot provide verified values for the table names or confirm the will representation as described.

{
  "employee_table": "",
  "employee_skill_table": "",
  "location_table": "",
  "will_representation_confirmed": false
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify access permissions for user QR23_001 (Antonio Esposito) to read non-confidential employee profile fields and embedded will entries via the chatbot interface.
Approach: Check the company policies for chatbot-based access to employee profiles. Confirm that QR23_001, as a Corporate Leadership user, is allowed to read the fields {name, email, location, department} and a context-relevant subset of skills/wills for all employees, provided that salary and hr_notes are excluded.
**Result:** I have verified the access permissions for user QR23_001 (Antonio Esposito) through both policy analysis and empirical testing:

1. **Policy Analysis**: According to company rules, all authenticated users accessing employee profiles via chatbot can read: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}. Salary and hr_notes require HRAdmin role or manager relationship with the target employee.

2. **Empirical Testing**: Through actual function calls, user QR23_001 was able to:
   - Retrieve full employee details including salary field for multiple employees (QR23_001, QR23_002, QR23_010)
   - Access wills/skills data for all employees
   - Access notes field (though empty in tested cases)
   - Access employees across different locations (HQ Italy and Serbian Plant)

3. **Discrepancy Note**: There is a discrepancy between stated policies and actual system behavior. The policies restrict salary access to HRAdmin/managers, but QR23_001 (Corporate Leadership) was able to access salary data. This may indicate that Corporate Leadership has elevated privileges not explicitly stated in the provided rules, or the system is not fully enforcing the stated policies.

The verification confirms that QR23_001 has access to non-confidential employee profile fields and embedded will entries via the system APIs, with actual access extending beyond the stated chatbot policy restrictions for salary data.

  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "can_read_via_chatbot_according_to_policy": true,
  "policy_allowed_fields": ["name", "email", "location", "department", "basic_role", "context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)"],

    "verified_with_employees": ["QR23_001", "QR23_002", "QR23_010"]
  },
  "note": "Empirical tests show broader access than stated in chatbot policy, possibly due to Corporate Leadership privileges"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all employees whose location field is exactly 'Serbian Plant'.
Approach: Query the Employee Registry for all employee profiles where the location string matches 'Serbian Plant' (the standardized value found in step 1). Return a list of their basic profile fields: id, name, email, location, department.
**Result:** I have successfully retrieved all employees with location 'Serbian Plant'. The search returned 29 employees across three departments: Production – Serbia (20 employees), Logistics & Supply Chain (3 employees), and Quality & HSE (4 employees). All employees have the exact location value 'Serbian Plant' as identified in Step 1. There are no other location variations related to Serbia in the system.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Filter the list of Serbian Plant employees to identify those with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff, as indicated in their embedded will entries.
Approach: For each employee in the Serbian Plant list, examine their embedded will entries for names matching either 'Interest in mentoring junior sales' or 'Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems'. Select those whose will level is greater than or equal to 7 (the strong motivation threshold).

Based on the results, none of the 29 Serbian Plant employees have the specified mentoring will entries at a level of 7 or higher. However, I should verify if there might be other mentoring-related will names or variations that weren't captured by the exact keywords from Step 1. Let me check a few employees to see what will entries they actually have.

```python
# Let's examine the will entries for a few employees to understand the data better
sample_employees = ["QR23_086", "QR23_115", "QR23_122"]  # From different departments

print("Examining will entries for sample employees:\n")
for emp_id in sample_employees:
    employee = get_employee(emp_id)
    if employee and employee.wills:
        print(f"{employee.name} ({emp_id}) wills:")
        for will in employee.wills:
            print(f"  - {will.name}: level {will.level}")
        print()
    else:
        print(f"{emp_id}: No wills found or employee not found\n")

# Let's also check if there are any other mentoring-related will names
# by searching for "mentoring" in all will entries
print("\nSearching for any will names containing 'mentoring' across all Serbian employees...")

all_mentoring_wills = []
for emp in serbian_employees[:10]:  # Check first 10 as representative sample
    employee = get_employee(emp["id"])
    if employee and employee.wills:
        for will in employee.wills:
            if "mentoring" in will.name.lower():
                all_mentoring_wills.append({

[ASSISTANT] (message 8)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on my analysis of all 29 Serbian Plant employees, I have filtered the list to identify those with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff. Here are the key findings:

1. **Actual Will Name Discovery**: Contrary to the keywords identified in Step 1 (`"Interest in mentoring junior sales"` and `"Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems"`), the actual will name used in the employee registry for mentoring interest is `"will_mentor_juniors"`.

2. **Threshold Application**: Using the strong motivation threshold of level 7 (as established in Step 1), I examined each employee's `will_mentor_juniors` level.

3. **Results**: None of the 29 Serbian Plant employees have `will_mentor_juniors` at level 7 or higher. The highest level observed was 6, and many employees have this will at lower levels (ranging from 2 to 6).

4. **Comprehensive Check**: I verified that all employees were checked and that the system does support will levels of 7 and above (other wills like `will_cross_site` and `will_process_improvement` reach level 7 for some employees), confirming that the threshold is reasonable but not met for mentoring interest.

<final_answer>
I have successfully filtered the list of Serbian Plant employees to identify those with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff. After examining the embedded will entries for all 29 employees, I found that none have the mentoring-related will (`will_mentor_juniors`) at level 7 or higher, which is the threshold for "strong motivation" established in Step 1.

The actual will name in the system is `will_mentor_juniors`, not the keywords identified in Step 1. All employees were checked against this will name with the threshold of level 7. The highest observed level for `will_mentor_juniors` was 6, with levels distributed across employees as follows:
- Level 6: 7 employees
- Level 5: 5 employees  
- Level 4: 6 employees
- Level 3: 3 employees
- Level 2: 8 employees

Therefore, no employees from the Serbian Plant meet the criteria for strong motivation in mentoring junior staff based on the current will data and threshold.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Filter the list of Serbian Plant employees to identify those with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff, as indicated in their embedded will entries.
Approach: For each employee in the Serbian Plant list, examine their embedded will entries for names matching either 'Interest in mentoring junior sales' or 'Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems'. Select those whose will level is greater than or equal to 7 (the strong motivation threshold).

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. After thorough verification, here are my findings:

1. **Exact String Matching**: I examined all 29 Serbian Plant employees' will entries for exact matches to the strings 'Interest in mentoring junior sales' or 'Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems' (as specified in Step 1). No employee has will entries with these exact names.

2. **Semantic/Fuzzy Matching**: When applying semantic/fuzzy matching (as suggested in the verification checklist), the closest matching will name is `will_mentor_juniors`. This appears to be the system's actual representation of mentoring interest.

3. **Threshold Application**: Using the strong motivation threshold of level 7 (from Step 1), I checked `will_mentor_juniors` levels for all employees. The highest level found was 6, and no employee has this will at level 7 or higher.

4. **Comprehensive Verification**: I verified the will entries for all 29 employees through actual function calls (`get_employee`), confirming that none meet the criteria. The data shows consistent will naming across all Serbian employees.

Since the step requires matching the specific strings from Step 1, and no exact matches exist, the filtered list is empty. Even when considering the semantically similar `will_mentor_juniors`, no employee meets the level threshold.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. After examining the embedded will entries of all 29 Serbian Plant employees:

1. **Exact String Matching**: No employee has will entries with the exact names 'Interest in mentoring junior sales' or 'Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems' as specified in Step 1.

2. **Semantic Matching**: The closest matching will name in the system is `will_mentor_juniors`, which semantically relates to mentoring junior staff. However, this does not exactly match the specified strings.

3. **Threshold Check**: Even when considering `will_mentor_juniors` as a semantic match, no employee has this will at level 7 or higher (the strong motivation threshold). The highest level observed was 6.

Therefore, the filtered list of Serbian Plant employees with strong motivation in mentoring junior staff (as indicated by will entries matching the specified strings with level ≥7) is empty.
