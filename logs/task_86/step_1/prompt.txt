Step 1: Understand internal terminology and data mapping for "Serbian Plant" and for motivation / interest in mentoring junior staff by consulting internal documentation or wiki.
Approach: Use company wiki or internal documentation search (search_wiki_fuzzy or equivalent) with **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms such as "Serbian plant", "Serbian factory", "Novi Sad site", "Serbia location", and for people development concepts like "mentoring juniors", "coaching junior staff", "mentoring will", "interest in mentoring". Account for typos, misspellings, pluralization, and alternative phrasings. From the results, determine which location.name values or standard labels correspond to the Serbian factory near Novi Sad, and identify standard will/skill names or tags used to record interest in mentoring junior staff, as well as what level (for example 4 or 5) is considered a "strong" motivation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"serbian_plant_location_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "mentoring_will_keywords": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_motivation_level_threshold": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["serbian_plant_location_names", "mentoring_will_keywords", "strong_motivation_level_threshold"]}
