I have successfully consulted the company wiki and internal documentation to understand the internal terminology for Serbian plant locations and mentoring interest levels. The analysis reveals:

1. **Serbian Plant Location Names**: The standard location field value for employees at the Serbian factory near Novi Sad is consistently "Serbian Plant" in the employee registry. This is confirmed both in the wiki documentation (company/locations_and_sites.md) and in actual employee data.

2. **Mentoring Will Keywords**: The system uses specific will names to record interest in mentoring junior staff. Based on example employee profiles, the exact will names are "Interest in mentoring junior sales" and "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems". These represent different aspects of mentoring interest.

3. **Strong Motivation Level Threshold**: According to the skills_and_wills_model.md documentation, the company uses a 1-10 rating scale where levels 7-8 are defined as "Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation". Therefore, the threshold for "strong motivation" is level 7.

These findings provide the necessary data mapping for the next step of identifying employees in the Serbian plant with strong motivation interest in mentoring junior staff.

{
  "serbian_plant_location_names": ["Serbian Plant"],
  "mentoring_will_keywords": ["Interest in mentoring junior sales", "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems"],
  "strong_motivation_level_threshold": 7
