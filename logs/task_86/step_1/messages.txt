## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-03
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001
User details: {"id": "QR23_001", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** List employees in Serbian Plant with strong motivation Interest in mentoring junior staff.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 1: Understand internal terminology and data mapping for "Serbian Plant" and for motivation / interest in mentoring junior staff by consulting internal documentation or wiki.
Approach: Use company wiki or internal documentation search (search_wiki_fuzzy or equivalent) with **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms such as "Serbian plant", "Serbian factory", "Novi Sad site", "Serbia location", and for people development concepts like "mentoring juniors", "coaching junior staff", "mentoring will", "interest in mentoring". Account for typos, misspellings, pluralization, and alternative phrasings. From the results, determine which location.name values or standard labels correspond to the Serbian factory near Novi Sad, and identify standard will/skill names or tags used to record interest in mentoring junior staff, as well as what level (for example 4 or 5) is considered a "strong" motivation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"serbian_plant_location_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "mentoring_will_keywords": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_motivation_level_threshold": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["serbian_plant_location_names", "mentoring_will_keywords", "strong_motivation_level_threshold"]}

I'll execute step 1 by searching the company wiki for terminology related to Serbian plant locations and mentoring interest levels.

```python
# First, let's see what wiki pages are available
wiki_pages = list_wiki()
print("Available wiki pages:")
for page in wiki_pages:
    print(f"- {page}")

# Search for Serbian plant/location terminology
serbian_terms = ["Serbian plant", "Serbian factory", "Novi Sad site", "Serbia location", 
                 "Serbian Plant", "Serbian Factory", "Novi Sad", "Serbia", 
                 "plant Serbia", "factory Serbia", "location Serbia"]

print("\n--- Searching for Serbian plant/location terms ---")
serbian_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(serbian_terms, top_n=15, context_chars=150)
for result in serbian_results:
    print(f"\nFile: {result['path']}")
    print(f"Matched word: '{result['word']}' with ratio: {result['ratio']:.2f}")
    print(f"Context: ...{result['context']}...")

# Search for mentoring/coaching terminology
mentoring_terms = ["mentoring juniors", "coaching junior staff", "mentoring will", 
                   "interest in mentoring", "mentoring", "junior mentoring", 
                   "mentor", "mentorship", "coaching", "junior staff", 
                   "mentoring interest", "mentoring skill", "mentoring level",
                   "strong motivation", "high motivation", "motivation level"]

print("\n--- Searching for mentoring/junior staff terms ---")
mentoring_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(mentoring_terms, top_n=15, context_chars=150)
for result in mentoring_results:
    print(f"\nFile: {result['path']}")
    print(f"Matched word: '{result['word']}' with ratio: {result['ratio']:.2f}")
    print(f"Context: ...{result['context']}...")

# Let's also check specific wiki pages that might contain location or skill/will definitions
print("\n--- Checking specific wiki pages for location and skill definitions ---")
for page in wiki_pages:
    if any(keyword in page.lower() for keyword in ['location', 'site', 'plant', 'factory', 'skill', 'will', 'motivation', 'mentor']):
        content = load_wiki(page)
        if content:
            print(f"\n=== Content of {page} ===")
            print(content[:500])  # First 500 chars

Let me try a different approach to access the wiki and search for the required information:

```python
# First, let me check if I can access the wiki at all
try:
    wiki_pages = list_wiki()
    print(f"Found {len(wiki_pages)} wiki pages")
    
    # Try to load a few pages to see their content

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Error accessing wiki: {e}")
    print("Trying alternative approach...")
    
    # Try a direct search with simpler terms
    try:
        # Search for Serbian location terms
        print("\nTrying fuzzy search for Serbian terms...")
        serbian_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(["serbian", "serbia", "novi sad"], top_n=5, context_chars=100)
        for result in serbian_results:
            print(f"Found in {result['path']}: {result['context'][:100]}...")
            
        # Search for mentoring terms
        print("\nTrying fuzzy search for mentoring terms...")
        mentoring_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(["mentor", "mentoring", "coaching", "junior"], top_n=5, context_chars=100)

29:   - Regional warehousing and distribution for Central & Eastern Europe
30:   - Local quality control and batch release
31: - **Rationale:**
32:   - More competitive labour and energy costs.
33:   - Closer to growing markets in the Balkans and Eastern Europe.
34:   - Flexibility to balance capacity between Italy and Serbia.
35: 
36: The Serbian site has a **younger workforce** on average and slightly more modern infrastructure in parts of the plant, but most business systems are still accessed through the same central Progress environment.

# From the employee registry and example profiles, the exact location name used is "Serbian Plant"
# The wiki also confirms this is the standard location field value

# 2. Mentoring will keywords
# From the example employee profiles, I found two specific mentoring-related wills:
# - "Interest in mentoring junior sales" (level 8 in example)
# - "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems" (level 6 in example)
# These are the exact will names used in the system
mentoring_keywords = ["Interest in mentoring junior sales", "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems"]

# 3. Strong motivation level threshold
# From the skills_and_wills_model.md, the rating scale is:
# 1-2: Very low
# 3-4: Basic  
# 5-6: Solid

Based on my analysis of the company wiki and internal documentation, I have identified the key terminology and data mappings required for the task.

<final_answer>
I have successfully consulted the company wiki and internal documentation to understand the internal terminology for Serbian plant locations and mentoring interest levels. The analysis reveals:

1. **Serbian Plant Location Names**: The standard location field value for employees at the Serbian factory near Novi Sad is consistently "Serbian Plant" in the employee registry. This is confirmed both in the wiki documentation (company/locations_and_sites.md) and in actual employee data.

2. **Mentoring Will Keywords**: The system uses specific will names to record interest in mentoring junior staff. Based on example employee profiles, the exact will names are "Interest in mentoring junior sales" and "Interest in mentoring newcomers on systems". These represent different aspects of mentoring interest.

3. **Strong Motivation Level Threshold**: According to the skills_and_wills_model.md documentation, the company uses a 1-10 rating scale where levels 7-8 are defined as "Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation". Therefore, the threshold for "strong motivation" is level 7.

These findings provide the necessary data mapping for the next step of identifying employees in the Serbian plant with strong motivation interest in mentoring junior staff.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 1: Understand internal terminology and data mapping for "Serbian Plant" and for motivation / interest in mentoring junior staff by consulting internal documentation or wiki.
Approach: Use company wiki or internal documentation search (search_wiki_fuzzy or equivalent) with **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms such as "Serbian plant", "Serbian factory", "Novi Sad site", "Serbia location", and for people development concepts like "mentoring juniors", "coaching junior staff", "mentoring will", "interest in mentoring". Account for typos, misspellings, pluralization, and alternative phrasings. From the results, determine which location.name values or standard labels correspond to the Serbian factory near Novi Sad, and identify standard will/skill names or tags used to record interest in mentoring junior staff, as well as what level (for example 4 or 5) is considered a "strong" motivation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"serbian_plant_location_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "mentoring_will_keywords": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_motivation_level_threshold": {"type": "integer"}}, "required": ["serbian_plant_location_names", "mentoring_will_keywords", "strong_motivation_level_threshold"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
