I have verified the access permissions for user QR23_001 (Antonio Esposito) through both policy analysis and empirical testing:

1. **Policy Analysis**: According to company rules, all authenticated users accessing employee profiles via chatbot can read: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}. Salary and hr_notes require HRAdmin role or manager relationship with the target employee.

2. **Empirical Testing**: Through actual function calls, user QR23_001 was able to:
   - Retrieve full employee details including salary field for multiple employees (QR23_001, QR23_002, QR23_010)
   - Access wills/skills data for all employees
   - Access notes field (though empty in tested cases)
   - Access employees across different locations (HQ Italy and Serbian Plant)

3. **Discrepancy Note**: There is a discrepancy between stated policies and actual system behavior. The policies restrict salary access to HRAdmin/managers, but QR23_001 (Corporate Leadership) was able to access salary data. This may indicate that Corporate Leadership has elevated privileges not explicitly stated in the provided rules, or the system is not fully enforcing the stated policies.

The verification confirms that QR23_001 has access to non-confidential employee profile fields and embedded will entries via the system APIs, with actual access extending beyond the stated chatbot policy restrictions for salary data.
