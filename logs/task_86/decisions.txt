DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:03:46
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was successfully completed and provided the required mappings for location names, mentoring will keywords, and the definition of 'strong motivation' as level 7 or higher. The output matches what the original plan prescribed as the required deliverable for step 1. There were no unexpected results, inconsistencies, or missing information that would require a replan. The next logical step according to the plan is step 2: to identify and confirm the technical data sources and schema for employees, locations, and will entries. Therefore, the plan remains valid and can proceed as written.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:11:23
Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
Step 2 did not return the expected results: we could not confirm the precise technical data sources, table names, or will representation details required by the remaining steps. Steps 3-5 as written are based on querying specific tables or fields which are not confirmed to exist as described. The discovered reality is that the data is stored in an employee registry with SkillLevel-type objects for wills/skills, and that locations appear to be a string field in the employee record, not a join to a separate location table, and there is no documented 'employee_skill' table as assumed by the plan. Therefore, remaining steps must be adjusted to use the actual discovered data layout (Employee Registry with embedded skills/wills and string field for location), not the originally assumed relational database structure.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:18:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps produced results aligned with the original plan. Step 3 confirmed both by policy and empirically that the user is allowed access to needed non-confidential employee fields and relevant will data, which matches requirements for Steps 4 and 5. There is no indication that the next steps cannot proceed or would produce unexpected output. The plan is still valid and executable. No replan is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:21:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All prior steps in the plan have completed successfully using valid approaches and correct data. The next step is directly achievable: we have a list of employees at 'Serbian Plant' with all required profile fields, and verified access to their embedded will entries. The system's policy and empirical results confirm the capability to filter these employees per the will keywords and motivation level, precisely as prescribed in the plan. No issues, missing information, or unexpected results have arisen that would require replanning.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:27:01
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been carried out strictly as specified. The confirmed data sources and policies were used. Step 5 produced a definitive result: no employees in the Serbian Plant have will entries exactly matching the required strings at or above the strong motivation threshold, and no semantically similar entry meets the threshold either. There are no remaining steps in the original plan. The answer is complete and in compliance with company policy and the original request.
