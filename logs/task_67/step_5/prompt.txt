Step 5: Execute the rename operation by updating the wiki_file record path from 'company/history.md' to 'company/history.md.bak'.
Approach: If the previous steps confirm that (1) the original wiki_file record for 'company/history.md' exists (or a clearly determined exact match exists), (2) no exact collision exists at 'company/history.md.bak', and (3) the user 'FphR_001' is authorized to perform the rename, then run an update operation in the Wiki system. Concretely, execute an SQL UPDATE on the wiki_file table: set path = 'company/history.md.bak' (and allow updated_at to be automatically refreshed) where path = 'company/history.md' (using the exact path or the unique identifier from the located record). Do not modify the content field or sha1 value; only change the path. Ensure that the operation affects exactly one row; if it affects zero or more than one row, capture that outcome as part of the result. This step should not write any additional content and therefore must not introduce any sensitive personal data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"old_path": {"type": "string"}, "new_path": {"type": "string"}, "rows_affected": {"type": "integer"}, "rename_successful": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["old_path", "new_path", "rows_affected", "rename_successful"]}
