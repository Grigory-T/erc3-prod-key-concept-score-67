Step 5 executed successfully using the available wiki API functions. Since there is no direct "rename" function, the operation was performed by:
1. Creating a new file at 'company/history.md.bak' with the original content (3431 characters)
2. Updating the original file 'company/history.md' with empty content

Verification confirms:
- The new file 'company/history.md.bak' exists and contains the original 3431 characters of content
- The old file 'company/history.md' now has empty content (0 characters) and is no longer listed among active wiki files
- Both update operations succeeded
- User FphR_001 (Nino Valente) from Corporate Leadership performed the operations

All facts were verified through function calls: `who_am_i()`, `list_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, and the `update_wiki()` calls returned success status. The state was changed exactly as described.
