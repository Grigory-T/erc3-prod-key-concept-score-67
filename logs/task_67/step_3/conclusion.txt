Successfully completed Step 3: Checked for potential name collision by determining whether a wiki file already exists at the intended new path 'company/history.md.bak'. The step was executed exactly as specified: performed an exact match search (no collision found), relaxed search for containment (no matches found), and performed fuzzy/semantic matching to identify closely similar paths (found 5 similar paths). All facts were explicitly verified through function calls: list_wiki() provided the complete wiki file list, and fuzzy_compare() identified similar paths with similarity scores. No state-changing operations were performed.
