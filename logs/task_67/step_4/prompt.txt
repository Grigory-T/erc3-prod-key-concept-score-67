Step 4: Verify that the current user has sufficient permissions to rename the specific wiki file from 'company/history.md' to 'company/history.md.bak'.
Approach: After confirming the existence (or best fuzzy candidate) of the original path in previous steps, perform a targeted backend_permission_check for user 'FphR_001' on the specific wiki_file resource whose path is intended to be changed. Use an action such as 'RenameWikiFile' or a combination of 'UpdateWikiFilePath' on the identified record. Take into account the user roles or system roles associated with 'FphR_001' (for example, Corporate Leadership or any WikiAdmin-like role if present). Ensure that the permission check is executed with the concrete resource identifier (for example, the exact wiki_file.path or primary key) and the intended operation, and that the result clearly indicates whether the rename operation is allowed or denied. Do not perform the rename in this step; this is only for permission verification.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "target_old_path": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "target_new_path": {"type": "string"}, "is_rename_allowed": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["user_id", "target_new_path", "is_rename_allowed"]}
