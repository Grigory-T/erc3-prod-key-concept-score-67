Step 2: Locate the existing wiki file record whose path should be renamed, primarily targeting 'company/history.md'.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table in the Wiki system for a record with an exact path match 'company/history.md'. If no record is found with an exact match, relax the search according to the mandated strategy: (1) attempt case-normalized and whitespace-trimmed comparison where 'company/history.md' is checked using a containment check in wiki_file.path fields (for example, LOWER(REPLACE(path, ' ', '')) LIKE '%company/history.md%'); (2) if still not found, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search using fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, or similar tools over wiki_file.path to catch potential typos, misspellings, or variations (for example, 'company/history.markdown', 'company/histroy.md', etc.); (3) as a last resort, list all wiki_file records and attempt to identify the closest match using fuzzy matching and semantic similarity between the desired path 'company/history.md' and existing paths. Names and paths may contain mistakes, so fuzzy matching, partial matching, and double checks must be applied. Do not modify the database in this step; only read and return the identified candidate record(s).
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_path_requested": {"type": "string"}, "exact_match_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "exact_match_record": {"type": ["object", "null"], "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "sha1": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "content_present": {"type": "boolean"}}}, "fuzzy_candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "similarity_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["path", "similarity_score"]}}}, "required": ["target_path_requested", "exact_match_found", "fuzzy_candidates"]}
