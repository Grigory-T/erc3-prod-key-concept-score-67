DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:20:39
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully: the authenticated user 'FphR_001' is verified as an internal employee with general wiki write access. This exactly matches the expectations for Step 1. There are no missing functions or discrepancies, and the output has all required properties per the plan. The next step is Step 2, which is to locate the wiki file to be renamed. The plan remains strictly executable as written, with no observable need to replan or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:22:26
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is progressing exactly as planned and the last completed step (Step 2) returned results aligned with expectations: the target wiki file 'company/history.md' was found as an exact match with content present. All validations have matched the conditions of the original plan and no discrepancies, missing information, or unusual outcomes have occurred. Therefore, it is appropriate to proceed to Step 3 as outlined.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:24:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All results up to and including Step 3 align precisely with the original plan and expected outputs. Step 3 successfully verified no collision or ambiguity at the intended new path, and the candidate original file is established. There are no inconsistencies or missing data; the next natural action is to run Step 4 and verify rename permission for the current user. No grounds exist for aborting or replanning—the plan is progressing as intended.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:27:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced expected results exactly as specified in the Original Plan. Each prerequisite for Step 5 is satisfied: (1) The original wiki file 'company/history.md' exists; (2) no collision exists at the target new path 'company/history.md.bak'; (3) the user has the necessary authorization for the rename. There have been no errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected outcomes. The plan remains valid and actionable. Proceed to Step 5 as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:34:29
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been completed exactly according to the original task and plan. There are no remaining steps. Step 5 verified that the rename operation succeeded: the file content is now at 'company/history.md.bak' and 'company/history.md' is empty. All operations followed company policies and no violations or inconsistencies occurred. The task goal has been met and the result is definitive.
