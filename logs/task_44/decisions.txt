DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:07:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous step (Step 1) was completed successfully and precisely according to the original plan. The authenticated user (Armando Fontana) has been identified, including all fields needed for subsequent authorization checks. There have been no errors, inconsistencies, or missing information so far. The next step in the plan is to locate the employee record for 'Đoković Radovan' in the employee table, which is both feasible and necessary given the progress. No replanning, abort, or premature final answer is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:12:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is proceeding strictly according to the original plan and the company rules. Steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully and as prescribed: the current user has been identified and the target employee (Radovan Đoković) has been unambiguously found. There have been no unexpected results, errors, or requirement for a replan. The next logical step is Step 3, which is to check permissions for the salary and department information of the target employee, before any data retrieval. The conditions for continuation are met, and there is no reason to stop, replan, or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:14:22
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been executed in accordance with the Original Plan, and each step has yielded results strictly matching expected output and company policy. Steps 4 and 5 can be completed exactly as the plan specifies: retrieving and returning only the department (not salary), since permission for salary was denied according to HR and company rules. No unexpected outcomes, policy conflicts, or missing data/functions occurred. The plan remains valid and can be completed as intended.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:16:17
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
Steps 1–4 have been completed exactly as per the original plan. All relevant company policies and authorization checks have been strictly followed: the department of Radovan Đoković has been successfully retrieved and is accessible; the salary could not be accessed due to insufficient permission, as the current user is neither the employee nor an executive. Step 5, composing the final answer, is the last step and can be completed now. Thus, the task is complete, and the final answer can be returned.
