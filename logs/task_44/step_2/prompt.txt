Step 2: Locate the employee record for the person referred to as "Đoković Radovan" in the employee table, accounting for possible misspellings, diacritics, and variations in name order by using fuzzy and semantic / logical search.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the target employee. First, attempt an exact search on employee.name = 'Đoković Radovan'. If no exact match is found, normalize the query and candidate names by lowercasing, removing or simplifying diacritics (for example, treating 'Đ' similarly to 'Dj'), and trimming whitespace, then search where the normalized query string is contained in normalized employee.name (substring search). If still not unique, use fuzzy matching (for example, Levenshtein distance or similar fuzzy_compare over employee.name) and possibly semantic / logical matching over full_name or related fields to get top N candidates. Consider partial matching and different name orders (for example, 'Radovan Đoković' versus 'Đoković Radovan'). Interpret the fuzzy scores to select the most likely single employee if there is a clear best match; otherwise, mark as not uniquely found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched":{"type":"boolean"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["query_name","matched","matches","selected_employee_id"]}
