Step 2 has been successfully executed. I followed the step instructions precisely:

1. **Exact search**: First attempted exact search for "Đoković Radovan" - found 0 matches.
2. **Normalized substring search**: Normalized names by lowercasing and simplifying diacritics (Đ→Dj, ć→c, č→c), then searched for "djokovic radovan" in normalized employee names - no substring matches were found.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Used fuzzy_compare() on all 154 employees, which returned top 10 matches with varying similarity ratios (0.414-0.545).
4. **Semantic/logical matching**: 
   - Found that "Radovan Đoković" (ID: QR23_116) contains both name components "Radovan" and "Đoković"
   - Searched with reversed name order "Radovan Đoković" and found exact match
   - This represents the same person with name order reversed (family name first vs given name first)
5. **Selection logic**: Selected "Radovan Đoković" (QR23_116) as the clear match since it uniquely contains both name components and represents the same individual with reversed name order.

All data was verified through function returns - no assumptions or made-up data were used. No state-changing update functions were called. The email addresses were verified by retrieving full employee records.
