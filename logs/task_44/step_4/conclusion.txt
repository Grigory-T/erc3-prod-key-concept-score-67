Completed: 2025-12-09 21:16:12

Step 4 has been successfully executed according to the verification checklist. I confirm:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Had a valid target_employee_id (QR23_116) from step 2
   - Performed a query on the employee table using `get_employee(target_employee_id)`
   - Read the department field because `can_view_department` was true
   - Did NOT access the salary field because `can_view_salary` was false
   - Set `salary_accessed` to false and `salary` to null as instructed

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**:
   - All permission checks were based on Step 3 results
   - All employee data was retrieved from the actual function call
   - No state-changing update functions were called

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - Employee existence verified via `get_employee("QR23_116")` call
   - Department value ("Logistics & Supply Chain") came directly from the employee object
   - Salary was intentionally not accessed as per permission rules
   - All JSON values match the printed output from code execution

All data was derived from function returns without using make-up data or sensible defaults.

{
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_116",
  "salary_accessed": false,
  "department_accessed": true,
  "salary": null,
  "department": "Logistics & Supply Chain"
}
