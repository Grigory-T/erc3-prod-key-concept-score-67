I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. Here is my verification:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I followed the approach precisely:
   - Verified step 2 provided a single employee (selected_employee_id = "QR23_116", matched = true)
   - Applied the permission rules exactly as specified:
     - `can_view_salary = (current_user.user_id == selected_employee_id) OR current_user.is_executive`
     - `can_view_department = True` (as per general EmployeeProfile rules)
   - Generated a human-readable reason summarizing the decision

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used the exact values from previous steps: user_id="QR23_133", is_executive=false (from step 1)
   - I used the exact target_employee_id="QR23_116" (from step 2)
   - I verified the employee exists by calling `get_employee("QR23_116")` and confirmed the employee "Radovan Đoković" exists
   - No state-changing update functions were called

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - Current user identity verified from step 1 results
   - Target employee ID verified from step 2 results
   - Employee existence verified via `get_employee()` function call
   - All boolean calculations based on actual data, not assumptions

4. **JSON values explicitly verified**:
   - `user_id`: "QR23_133" (from step 1)
   - `target_employee_id`: "QR23_116" (from step 2)
   - `can_view_salary`: false (calculated: QR23_133 ≠ QR23_116 AND is_executive=false)
   - `can_view_department`: true (as per company rules for all employees)
   - `reason`: Generated based on the permission logic

All data comes from function returns or previous step results. No made-up data or sensible defaults were used.

{
  "user_id": "QR23_133",
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_116",
  "can_view_salary": false,
  "can_view_department": true,
  "reason": "User is not the employee and not executive; salary access denied, department access allowed"
}
