Step 1: Identify the currently authenticated user (Armando Fontana, user id QR23_133) including department, location, system roles and whether the user is considered an executive, using a who_am_i() or equivalent identity service.
Approach: Call the central identity/authorization service (for example, who_am_i()) to retrieve the full identity profile of the current user. Do not infer or assume any roles. Use the returned data to confirm the user id, name, department, location, list of system roles (such as Human Resources Administrator, Executive, Manager, etc.), and a boolean flag indicating whether the user is an executive-level employee. This information will later be used for permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"is_executive":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","is_executive"]}
