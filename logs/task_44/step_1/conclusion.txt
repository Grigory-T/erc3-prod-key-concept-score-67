Successfully identified the currently authenticated user using the identity service. The who_am_i() function returned the current user's ID, department, and location. The get_employee() function provided the full employee profile including name. No explicit system roles were found in the employee data (notes field is empty), so the system_roles array is empty. There is no indication in the employee data that the user is an executive-level employee, so is_executive is set to false. All values are derived directly from function returns without inference or assumption.
