DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 18:54:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have executed as per the original plan and produced relevant, correct results. The current step identified 'Structural steel protection system' as most likely a project, aligned with expected company activities and documentation. There are no inconsistencies or missing data. There are no indications so far that the task cannot be completed, and no evidence that the plan needs adjustment. Thus, according to the strict instructions, continue to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 18:56:43
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both completed steps (Step 1 and Step 2) produced relevant, correct results according to the original plan. The entity type has been clarified as a project, and the technical mapping to project/team_member/employee tables is unambiguous and properly verified. There are no inconsistencies or issues in the process so far. The remaining steps can proceed as planned and are theoretically capable of completing the task. Replanning is not needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:00:04
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced the expected, correct outputs in line with the original plan. Each completed step verified its own requirements, there are no inconsistencies or missing data, and there is nothing to indicate that the plan must be changed. Step 4 and Step 5 remain as designed and are feasible based on the current knowledge and data access. Therefore, the correct next action is to continue to Step 4 as per the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:13:22
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Each step has produced the expected results according to the original plan. Steps 1 through 4 have all completed successfully: the entity is determined to be a project, permissions were validated, and the exact matching project ID was found. No unexpected results or missing information have occurred. The remaining step (retrieving team leads for the project) is expected to succeed, as the correct project_id has been identified and access is confirmed. Therefore, the plan should proceed as laid out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:15:00
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been executed successfully according to the task requirements. Step 5 produced a clear, verified result: Giorgia Ricci is the team lead for the project 'Structural steel protection system' (project_id: proj_iberia_structural_steel). There are no remaining steps and the answer is definitive. Company rules were followed throughout, and no replan or abort is needed.
