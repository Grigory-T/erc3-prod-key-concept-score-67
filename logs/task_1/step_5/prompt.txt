Step 5: Retrieve the team lead(s) for the identified project "Structural steel protection system" by querying team_member records for role = 'Lead' and joining to employee information.
Approach: Using selected_project_id from Step 4 (assuming it is non-null and permissions from Step 3 allow reading), query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id equals this project identifier and team_member.role = 'Lead'. For each such record, join to the employee table via employee.id = team_member.employee_id to obtain the employee's name, email, location, department, and confirm the role. Handle potential multiple leads or zero leads by returning an array (which may be empty). Do not access or return salary or confidential HR notes. The resulting team_leads array will directly answer who the team lead on the "Structural steel protection system" is.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_leads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","role"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_leads"]}
