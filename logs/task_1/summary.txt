## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify what the term "Structural steel protection system" refers to (for example, project, product, internal program) by searching internal documentation (wiki_file table and similar sources), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle potential ambiguity, abbreviations, typos, and partial matches.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table as the primary internal documentation source. Perform an initial exact search for the normalized string "structural steel protection system" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content. If no clear match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) case-insensitive substring search on path and content with whitespace removed from the search term; (2) FUZZY matching using a fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text style approach on titles, headings, and content snippets to find top N related pages; (3) SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (for example, using natural language processing embeddings, if available) to match conceptually similar pages such as those mentioning structural steel, fire protection, or coating systems. From the resulting matches, determine the best-guess entity type (for example, project, product line, technical system) and normalized entity name related to "Structural steel protection system".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"reference_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","confidence"]}},"best_guess_entity_type":{"type":"string"},"best_guess_entity_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["reference_term","wiki_matches","best_guess_entity_type","best_guess_entity_name"]}
**Result:** I have completed a thorough search to clarify what "Structural steel protection system" refers to. Here's a summary of the process and findings:

1. **Exact Search**: No exact matches found for "structural steel protection system" in wiki files using regex or case-insensitive substring search.

2. **Fuzzy Search (Individual Words)**: The term was broken into individual words ["structural", "steel", "protection", "system"]. Fuzzy search on these words returned 9 unique wiki files with higher confidence scores (0.80-0.95). Top matches include:
   - `company/overview.md` (confidence: 0.95)
   - `company/history.md` (confidence: 0.93)
   - `business/markets_and_customers.md` (confidence: 0.93)

3. **Semantic/Logical Search**: Searched for related concepts ["steel", "protection", "coating", "fireproof", "industrial", "structural"] and found 3 additional semantic matches.

4. **Project Registry Check**: Searched for projects containing related terms and found multiple projects with "steel", "protection", or "structural" in their names/IDs.

5. **Customer Registry Check**: Found customers containing "steel" in their names.

6. **Content Analysis**: Examined the top wiki matches in detail. The content reveals that Bellini Industria Vernici specializes in industrial coatings and protection systems, including applications for structural steel.

Based on the comprehensive search and analysis:
- The term "Structural steel protection system" is most likely a **project** or **technical system** within the company's scope.
- The company's business focus includes corrosion protection and coating systems for structural steel applications.
- While no exact documentation matches the specific term, the context suggests it's related to the company's core business activities.

All facts were verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed during this search.

    }
  ],
  "best_guess_entity_type": "project",
  "best_guess_entity_name": "Structural steel protection system"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the relevant technical implementation (database tables and keys) needed to determine the team lead for the entity identified as "Structural steel protection system" (expected to be a project or similar), based on the available SQL schema.
Approach: Using the best_guess_entity_type from Step 1, map the concept to existing core entities in the SQL schema. If it is a project or initiative, select the project table as the primary table and the team_member and employee tables as supporting tables for team roles. Confirm that these tables contain the fields needed to infer a "team lead" (for example, team_member.role = 'Lead'). If the mapping is unambiguous, record project as the primary_table and team_member and employee as supporting mapped_tables. If the entity_type cannot be mapped to an implemented object type in the given SQL schema, signal that no suitable implementation exists (which would be used later for an abort decision).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entity_type":{"type":"string"},"mapped_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"primary_table":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["entity_type","mapped_tables","primary_table","implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 2 by analyzing the available functions and data structures to identify the technical implementation needed to determine the team lead. Based on Step 1's conclusion that "Structural steel protection system" is a project entity, I examined the ProjectFull data structure which contains a team list with TeamMember objects that have role fields. I verified this structure by retrieving actual project data, which showed projects with team members having roles including "Lead." This confirms the necessary tables exist in the SQL schema to identify team leads. No state-changing operations were performed during this verification.

All facts were explicitly verified through function returns:
1. ProjectFull structure includes team: list[TeamMember]
2. TeamMember structure includes role field
3. Actual projects retrieved show team members with role="Lead"
4. The system provides functions to access project and employee data

The mapping is unambiguous: the project entity type corresponds to the project table as primary, with team_member and employee as supporting tables.

{
  "entity_type": "project",
  "mapped_tables": ["team_member", "employee"],
  "primary_table": "project",
  "implementation_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Giorgia Ricci, id=QR23_006) to read project and team membership information needed to identify the team lead.
Approach: Call a who_am_i-style permission check using the bound identity of the current user (QR23_006), retrieving her system_roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent identity source. Based on company rules, confirm that reading project, team_member, and employee non-confidential fields (name, email, location, department) is allowed for this user and that no salary or confidential HR notes will be accessed. Do not attempt any write operations. Record in the output whether can_read_projects and can_read_team_members are true, and if any denial occurs, note that further steps requiring protected data must not be executed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_read_projects","can_read_team_members"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed: Verified permissions for user QR23_006 (Giorgia Ricci). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) and successfully accessed project and team member data through function calls, confirming read permissions. System roles could not be retrieved from the available functions as they are not included in the EmployeeFull model or WhoAmI response. However, based on company rules and successful data access, the user can read project information and non-confidential team member fields. No write operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "QR23_006",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_projects": true,
  "can_read_team_members": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Find the project record that corresponds to "Structural steel protection system" in the project table, using the mandated search strategy including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to handle possible naming variations or typos.
Approach: Query the project table using a multi-stage search: (1) attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id for the normalized string "Structural steel protection system"; (2) if no result, perform case-insensitive substring search where the normalized term (lowercased, trimmed) is contained within project.name or project.description; (3) if still ambiguous or no match, apply regex or partial-word search to catch close variants (for example, including or excluding words like "system", "solution", or pluralization); (4) finally, use FUZZY matching (fuzzy_find_in_text) on project.name and description to get top N candidates, and optionally SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to rank projects related to structural steel coatings or protection systems. From all candidates, compile a list with match scores and, if there is a single high-confidence match, select its project_id as selected_project_id; otherwise leave selected_project_id null to signal ambiguity that would require clarification in execution.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["query","candidate_projects","selected_project_id"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 4 by finding the project record that corresponds to "Structural steel protection system" using the mandated multi-stage search strategy. All facts were verified through function returns:

1. **Exact Match**: Found one exact match - project ID `proj_iberia_structural_steel` with name "Structural steel protection system" (match score: 1.0)

2. **Substring Search**: No additional substring matches found beyond the exact match.

3. **Partial Word Search**: Found 4 partial matches with scores between 0.50-0.75.

4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Applied `fuzzy_compare` and `fuzzy_find_in_text` to identify top 10 candidates with match scores ranging from 0.40 to 1.00.

5. **Semantic/Logical Search**: Considered projects related to structural steel, coatings, and protection systems.

The search identified 10 candidate projects sorted by match score. The exact match (`proj_iberia_structural_steel`) has a perfect score of 1.0, making it the clear selection. All project descriptions were verified by calling `get_project()` for each candidate.

No state-changing operations were performed during this step. All data was retrieved using read-only functions as required.

}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve the team lead(s) for the identified project "Structural steel protection system" by querying team_member records for role = 'Lead' and joining to employee information.
Approach: Using selected_project_id from Step 4 (assuming it is non-null and permissions from Step 3 allow reading), query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id equals this project identifier and team_member.role = 'Lead'. For each such record, join to the employee table via employee.id = team_member.employee_id to obtain the employee's name, email, location, department, and confirm the role. Handle potential multiple leads or zero leads by returning an array (which may be empty). Do not access or return salary or confidential HR notes. The resulting team_leads array will directly answer who the team lead on the "Structural steel protection system" is.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_leads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","role"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_leads"]}
**Result:** Step 5 has been successfully executed. I retrieved the project details for "proj_iberia_structural_steel", filtered team members with role 'Lead', and joined employee information for the lead. All data was explicitly verified through function returns: the project has one team lead, Giorgia Ricci (QR23_006). No salary or confidential HR notes were accessed or included in the output. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "project_id": "proj_iberia_structural_steel",
  "team_leads": [
    {
      "employee_id": "QR23_006",
      "name": "Giorgia Ricci",
      "email": "QR23_006@bellini.internal",
      "location": "HQ – Italy",
      "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
      "role": "Lead"
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The team lead for the project 'Structural steel protection system' is Giorgia Ricci (QR23_006), based at HQ – Italy. Email: QR23_006@bellini.internal, Department: Sales & Customer Success.
