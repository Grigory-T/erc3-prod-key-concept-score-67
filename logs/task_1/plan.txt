Steps:
  1. Clarify what the term "Structural steel protection system" refers to (for example, project, product, internal program) by searching internal documentation (wiki_file table and similar sources), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle potential ambiguity, abbreviations, typos, and partial matches.
     Approach: Use the wiki_file table as the primary internal documentation source. Perform an initial exact search for the normalized string "structural steel protection system" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content. If no clear match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) case-insensitive substring search on path and content with whitespace removed from the search term; (2) FUZZY matching using a fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text style approach on titles, headings, and content snippets to find top N related pages; (3) SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (for example, using natural language processing embeddings, if available) to match conceptually similar pages such as those mentioning structural steel, fire protection, or coating systems. From the resulting matches, determine the best-guess entity type (for example, project, product line, technical system) and normalized entity name related to "Structural steel protection system".
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"reference_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","confidence"]}},"best_guess_entity_type":{"type":"string"},"best_guess_entity_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["reference_term","wiki_matches","best_guess_entity_type","best_guess_entity_name"]}
  2. Identify the relevant technical implementation (database tables and keys) needed to determine the team lead for the entity identified as "Structural steel protection system" (expected to be a project or similar), based on the available SQL schema.
     Approach: Using the best_guess_entity_type from Step 1, map the concept to existing core entities in the SQL schema. If it is a project or initiative, select the project table as the primary table and the team_member and employee tables as supporting tables for team roles. Confirm that these tables contain the fields needed to infer a "team lead" (for example, team_member.role = 'Lead'). If the mapping is unambiguous, record project as the primary_table and team_member and employee as supporting mapped_tables. If the entity_type cannot be mapped to an implemented object type in the given SQL schema, signal that no suitable implementation exists (which would be used later for an abort decision).
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entity_type":{"type":"string"},"mapped_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"primary_table":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["entity_type","mapped_tables","primary_table","implementation_found"]}
  3. Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Giorgia Ricci, id=QR23_006) to read project and team membership information needed to identify the team lead.
     Approach: Call a who_am_i-style permission check using the bound identity of the current user (QR23_006), retrieving her system_roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent identity source. Based on company rules, confirm that reading project, team_member, and employee non-confidential fields (name, email, location, department) is allowed for this user and that no salary or confidential HR notes will be accessed. Do not attempt any write operations. Record in the output whether can_read_projects and can_read_team_members are true, and if any denial occurs, note that further steps requiring protected data must not be executed.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_read_projects","can_read_team_members"]}
  4. Find the project record that corresponds to "Structural steel protection system" in the project table, using the mandated search strategy including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to handle possible naming variations or typos.
     Approach: Query the project table using a multi-stage search: (1) attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id for the normalized string "Structural steel protection system"; (2) if no result, perform case-insensitive substring search where the normalized term (lowercased, trimmed) is contained within project.name or project.description; (3) if still ambiguous or no match, apply regex or partial-word search to catch close variants (for example, including or excluding words like "system", "solution", or pluralization); (4) finally, use FUZZY matching (fuzzy_find_in_text) on project.name and description to get top N candidates, and optionally SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to rank projects related to structural steel coatings or protection systems. From all candidates, compile a list with match scores and, if there is a single high-confidence match, select its project_id as selected_project_id; otherwise leave selected_project_id null to signal ambiguity that would require clarification in execution.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["query","candidate_projects","selected_project_id"]}
  5. Retrieve the team lead(s) for the identified project "Structural steel protection system" by querying team_member records for role = 'Lead' and joining to employee information.
     Approach: Using selected_project_id from Step 4 (assuming it is non-null and permissions from Step 3 allow reading), query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id equals this project identifier and team_member.role = 'Lead'. For each such record, join to the employee table via employee.id = team_member.employee_id to obtain the employee's name, email, location, department, and confirm the role. Handle potential multiple leads or zero leads by returning an array (which may be empty). Do not access or return salary or confidential HR notes. The resulting team_leads array will directly answer who the team lead on the "Structural steel protection system" is.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_leads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","role"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_leads"]}
