Step 2: Identify the relevant technical implementation (database tables and keys) needed to determine the team lead for the entity identified as "Structural steel protection system" (expected to be a project or similar), based on the available SQL schema.
Approach: Using the best_guess_entity_type from Step 1, map the concept to existing core entities in the SQL schema. If it is a project or initiative, select the project table as the primary table and the team_member and employee tables as supporting tables for team roles. Confirm that these tables contain the fields needed to infer a "team lead" (for example, team_member.role = 'Lead'). If the mapping is unambiguous, record project as the primary_table and team_member and employee as supporting mapped_tables. If the entity_type cannot be mapped to an implemented object type in the given SQL schema, signal that no suitable implementation exists (which would be used later for an abort decision).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entity_type":{"type":"string"},"mapped_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"primary_table":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["entity_type","mapped_tables","primary_table","implementation_found"]}
