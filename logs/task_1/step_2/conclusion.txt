I executed Step 2 by analyzing the available functions and data structures to identify the technical implementation needed to determine the team lead. Based on Step 1's conclusion that "Structural steel protection system" is a project entity, I examined the ProjectFull data structure which contains a team list with TeamMember objects that have role fields. I verified this structure by retrieving actual project data, which showed projects with team members having roles including "Lead." This confirms the necessary tables exist in the SQL schema to identify team leads. No state-changing operations were performed during this verification.

All facts were explicitly verified through function returns:
1. ProjectFull structure includes team: list[TeamMember]
2. TeamMember structure includes role field
3. Actual projects retrieved show team members with role="Lead"
4. The system provides functions to access project and employee data

The mapping is unambiguous: the project entity type corresponds to the project table as primary, with team_member and employee as supporting tables.

{
  "entity_type": "project",
  "mapped_tables": ["team_member", "employee"],
  "primary_table": "project",
  "implementation_found": true
}
