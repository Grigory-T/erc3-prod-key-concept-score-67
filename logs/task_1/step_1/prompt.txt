Step 1: Clarify what the term "Structural steel protection system" refers to (for example, project, product, internal program) by searching internal documentation (wiki_file table and similar sources), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle potential ambiguity, abbreviations, typos, and partial matches.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table as the primary internal documentation source. Perform an initial exact search for the normalized string "structural steel protection system" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content. If no clear match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) case-insensitive substring search on path and content with whitespace removed from the search term; (2) FUZZY matching using a fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text style approach on titles, headings, and content snippets to find top N related pages; (3) SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (for example, using natural language processing embeddings, if available) to match conceptually similar pages such as those mentioning structural steel, fire protection, or coating systems. From the resulting matches, determine the best-guess entity type (for example, project, product line, technical system) and normalized entity name related to "Structural steel protection system".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"reference_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","confidence"]}},"best_guess_entity_type":{"type":"string"},"best_guess_entity_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["reference_term","wiki_matches","best_guess_entity_type","best_guess_entity_name"]}
