Completed: 2025-12-09 19:13:19

I have successfully completed Step 4 by finding the project record that corresponds to "Structural steel protection system" using the mandated multi-stage search strategy. All facts were verified through function returns:

1. **Exact Match**: Found one exact match - project ID `proj_iberia_structural_steel` with name "Structural steel protection system" (match score: 1.0)

2. **Substring Search**: No additional substring matches found beyond the exact match.

3. **Partial Word Search**: Found 4 partial matches with scores between 0.50-0.75.

4. **Fuzzy Matching**: Applied `fuzzy_compare` and `fuzzy_find_in_text` to identify top 10 candidates with match scores ranging from 0.40 to 1.00.

5. **Semantic/Logical Search**: Considered projects related to structural steel, coatings, and protection systems.

The search identified 10 candidate projects sorted by match score. The exact match (`proj_iberia_structural_steel`) has a perfect score of 1.0, making it the clear selection. All project descriptions were verified by calling `get_project()` for each candidate.

No state-changing operations were performed during this step. All data was retrieved using read-only functions as required.
