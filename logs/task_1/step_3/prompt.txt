Step 3: Verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Giorgia Ricci, id=QR23_006) to read project and team membership information needed to identify the team lead.
Approach: Call a who_am_i-style permission check using the bound identity of the current user (QR23_006), retrieving her system_roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent identity source. Based on company rules, confirm that reading project, team_member, and employee non-confidential fields (name, email, location, department) is allowed for this user and that no salary or confidential HR notes will be accessed. Do not attempt any write operations. Record in the output whether can_read_projects and can_read_team_members are true, and if any denial occurs, note that further steps requiring protected data must not be executed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_read_projects","can_read_team_members"]}
