Step 3 completed: Verified permissions for user QR23_006 (Giorgia Ricci). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) and successfully accessed project and team member data through function calls, confirming read permissions. System roles could not be retrieved from the available functions as they are not included in the EmployeeFull model or WhoAmI response. However, based on company rules and successful data access, the user can read project information and non-confidential team member fields. No write operations were performed.
