STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I have executed Step 3 as instructed. I created a plain-language explanation of time entry statuses by:

1. **Combining information from previous steps**: I used the status definitions from Step 1 and the technical understanding from Step 2 to draft comprehensive explanations for each status.

2. **Following the approach requirements**: For each status, I wrote concise, non-technical sentences explaining:
   - Who usually sets it (employee, supervisor, operations team)
   - What it implies for the employee (editing permissions, review status)
   - Where it sits in the lifecycle (workflow position)

3. **Validating for sensitive data**: I checked the content for sensitive keywords (salary, wage, payment, etc.) and confirmed it contains no sensitive personal data.

4. **Organizing in markdown format**: I structured the content with headings and bullet points for clarity and brevity.

All facts are verified from the function returns in previous steps. The status definitions come directly from the documented content found in Step 1, and the workflow understanding comes from the technical findings in Step 2. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

  "markdown_content": "# Time Entry Statuses - Plain Language Explanation\n\nThis document explains what each time entry status means and how entries typically move through the system.\n\n## Status Definitions\n\n**Draft**\n- You are still working on or editing this time entry\n- You can make changes, corrections, or delete it as needed\n- This is the starting point for all new time entries\n\n**Submitted**\n- You have marked this time entry as complete for a specific period (week, month, etc.)\n- The entry is ready for review by your supervisor or operations team\n- Once submitted, you can't edit it yourself without going through a correction process\n\n**Approved**\n- Your supervisor or the operations team has reviewed and accepted the time entry\n- The hours have been verified for accuracy and consistency with project requirements\n- Approved entries are ready to be used for billing or reporting\n\n**Invoiced**\n- The time entry has been included in a customer invoice or used for internal reporting\n- Entries at this stage are effectively locked and cannot be changed\n- This is the final stage for billable work that has been processed\n\n**Voided**\n- The time entry has been cancelled (for example, if it was logged on the wrong project)\n- A voided entry is no longer active and should be accompanied by a correcting entry\n- This status is used for errors that need to be removed from the system\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Start as Draft** → You log your hours and save as draft while you're working\n\n2. **Submit for Review** → When you're finished with a period (like the end of the week), you submit your drafts\n\n3. **Supervisor Approval** → Your supervisor reviews and approves submitted entries\n\n4. **Billing/Invoicing** → Approved entries are used to generate customer invoices or reports\n\n5. **Void if Needed** → If an error is found, entries can be voided (and corrected with a new entry)\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Once an entry reaches \"invoiced\" status, it cannot be edited directly\n- If you need to correct an invoiced entry, you must work with the operations team\n- Project leads can log time for team members, but only as draft entries\n- Each status change is tracked and audited in the system\n\nRemember: Keep your time entries accurate and submit them regularly to ensure smooth project tracking and timely billing.",
