We are at Step 3. We need to draft a short, plain-language explanation of the time entry statuses and their typical flow, in markdown format, for the wiki.
 We have gathered information from steps 1 and 2. We must ensure no sensitive data is included.
 Approach:
   - Use the definitions and transition rules we found.
   - Write in plain language, non-technical, clear and concise.
   - Format in markdown with headings and bullet points.
   - Validate that we don't include any sensitive data (salaries, etc.)

 We are to output a JSON with two fields: markdown_content (string) and contains_sensitive_data (boolean).

 We'll structure the markdown content as follows (based on the expected output and the information we have):

 1. Brief introduction.
 2. List of statuses with explanation (each in a bullet or numbered list, or with subheadings).
 3. Typical flow (or transitions) between statuses.

 However, note that the expected output does not require a complex structure, just a string of markdown.

 Let's create the content:

 We have the following definitions from step 1 and step 2:

 - draft: Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed.
 - submitted: Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month).
 - approved: Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency.
 - invoiced: Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked.
 - voided: Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry.

 Transition rules (from step 2) give us the typical flow and triggers.

 We can write:

 # Time Entry Statuses

 This document explains the different statuses a time entry can have and how they typically progress.

 ## Status Definitions

 - **Draft**: The employee is still working on the entry and can make changes.
 - **Submitted**: The employee has completed the entry for the period (like a week or month) and it's ready for review.
 - **Approved**: A supervisor or operations team member has reviewed the entry and confirmed it's accurate and complete.
 - **Invoiced**: The entry has been included in a customer invoice or internal report and is now locked for further changes.
 - **Voided**: The entry was cancelled (for example, because it was logged on the wrong project) and is no longer active. A correcting entry is usually created to replace it.

 ## Typical Lifecycle

 1. **Draft → Submitted**: When the employee finishes their timesheet for the period, they submit it.
 2. **Submitted → Approved**: A supervisor or operations team member reviews and approves the submitted entries.
 3. **Approved → Invoiced**: Once the time is billed to a customer or used in reporting, the status changes to invoiced and the entry is locked.
 4. **Voided**: If an entry is incorrect, it can be voided (from draft, submitted, or approved status) and a new correcting entry should be created.

 Note: Once an entry is invoiced, it cannot be changed. If a correction is needed after invoicing, a separate correcting entry must be created and the original remains invoiced.

 We must check that we don't include sensitive data. The content above does not mention salaries or any personal information.

 Let's set contains_sensitive_data to false.

 However, note: the user is in Corporate Leadership, so they have access to more data, but we are just writing a general explanation.

 We'll output the markdown content as a string and the boolean.

 Important: The output must be in JSON format within <json> tags.

 Let's write the code to generate the markdown content and then output the JSON.

Now I need to provide the final answer with JSON output as per the expected output format. The step asked for drafting a short, plain-language explanation and checking for sensitive data. I've done that and printed the result. The markdown content is ready, and contains_sensitive_data is False.

I should output the JSON in the required format. Note: The markdown content is quite long, but that's fine as it's the full draft. I need to ensure the JSON is valid.

Let me construct the final answer with the JSON. I'll include the markdown content exactly as I generated it, and the boolean flag.

We are at Step 3. The task is to draft a plain-language explanation of time entry statuses.

 We have already executed the step and produced the markdown content and checked for sensitive data.

 However, the verification checklist asks us to confirm that we executed the step instruction and that all facts are verified.

 Let's review:

 1. We did execute the step by creating a markdown content string.

 2. We used the information from the previous steps (status definitions and transition rules) to draft the content.

 3. We validated that the content does not contain sensitive data by checking for keywords.

 4. We did not call any update functions (this step is just drafting, no state change).

 5. We did not make up data; the status definitions and workflow are derived from the previous steps' results.

 However, note that the previous steps' results were based on wiki searches and technical findings. We are using that information.

 Let's double-check that the markdown content we produced matches the expected structure and content.

 The approach in Step 3 says: 
   "Combine and reconcile information from the documentation and technical findings from steps 1 and 2."

 We have done that.

 The expected output is a JSON with "markdown_content" and "contains_sensitive_data".

 We have that.

 But note: the checklist says "JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns."

 We printed the markdown content (first 500 chars) and the sensitive data check. The entire markdown content is in the JSON.

 However, we did not print the entire markdown content in the code execution, only a preview. But the JSON we are to return must contain the full string.

 We have the full string in the variable `markdown_content` and we are returning it.

 Also, note that the step says "suitable for inclusion as markdown content in the wiki". We have written in markdown.

 Let's also verify that we addressed each status and the workflow.

 We have a section for each status and a typical workflow section.

 We are confident.

 Since we are at verification, we can just repeat the final answer and JSON.

 However, note that the verification might be about the process. We did not skip any action.

 We did not use any make-up data. The status definitions are based on the raw definitions from step 1 and the internal meanings from step 2.

 Let's compare our drafted definitions with the raw definitions from step 1 and the internal meanings from step 2.

 From step 1, we had:
   - draft: "Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed."
   - submitted: "Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month)."
   - approved: "Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency."
   - invoiced: "Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked."
   - voided: "Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry."

 From step 2, we had the same internal meanings.

 Our drafted content expands on these with more user-friendly language, but the core meaning is the same.

 We also added workflow information from the transition rules.

 We are good.

 Let's output the same final answer and JSON.
