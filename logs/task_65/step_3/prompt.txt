Step 3: Draft a short, plain-language explanation that describes what each time entry status (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) means and how entries typically move between these statuses, suitable for inclusion as markdown content in the wiki, ensuring no sensitive data (such as salaries) is included.
Approach: Combine and reconcile information from the documentation and technical findings from steps 1 and 2. For each status, write one or two concise, non-technical sentences explaining: who usually sets it, what it implies for the employee and for billing, and where it sits in the usual lifecycle. Organize the explanation in markdown with headings and bullet points, keeping it brief and clear. Validate that the text does not contain any salary or other sensitive personal data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"markdown_content": {"type": "string"}, "contains_sensitive_data": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["markdown_content", "contains_sensitive_data"]}
