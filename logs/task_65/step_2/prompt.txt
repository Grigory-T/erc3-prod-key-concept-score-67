Step 2: Review technical implementation details for time entry status handling, including the time_entry table and any related application logic or services, to understand allowed statuses and typical status transitions, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to locate relevant code, configuration, or design documents even if names are abbreviated or slightly misspelled.
Approach: Inspect the given SQL schema for the time_entry.status field, then search code repositories and technical documentation (using fuzzy, partial, and semantic search) for references to "time_entry", "status", and related workflow functions or services (for example, APIs that change status from draft to submitted, etc.). Identify what each status practically means, who can change it, and in which order transitions usually happen. Summarize these findings into a structured internal representation without yet drafting final user-facing text.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"statuses_allowed": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "transition_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"from": {"type": "string"}, "to": {"type": "string"}, "trigger": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["from", "to"]}}, "status_meanings_internal": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["statuses_allowed", "status_meanings_internal"]}
