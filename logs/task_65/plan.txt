Steps:
  1. Search the internal wiki and other company documentation for existing explanations or guidelines about time entry statuses ("draft", "submitted", "approved", "invoiced", "voided"), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle ambiguous terms, abbreviations, and possible misspellings, and extract any relevant definitions or descriptions.
     Approach: Use wiki search tools (including fuzzy matching, partial matching, regex, and semantic / logical search) to look for pages and sections related to time tracking, time entries, or status workflows (for example, search terms like "time status", "time_entry status", "timesheet workflow"). If exact matches are not found, relax filters and use fuzzy and semantic search over page titles and content. Compile all found descriptions of each status and note their sources for later consolidation.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"source_docs": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "status_definitions_raw": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["source_docs", "status_definitions_raw"]}
  2. Review technical implementation details for time entry status handling, including the time_entry table and any related application logic or services, to understand allowed statuses and typical status transitions, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to locate relevant code, configuration, or design documents even if names are abbreviated or slightly misspelled.
     Approach: Inspect the given SQL schema for the time_entry.status field, then search code repositories and technical documentation (using fuzzy, partial, and semantic search) for references to "time_entry", "status", and related workflow functions or services (for example, APIs that change status from draft to submitted, etc.). Identify what each status practically means, who can change it, and in which order transitions usually happen. Summarize these findings into a structured internal representation without yet drafting final user-facing text.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"statuses_allowed": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "transition_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"from": {"type": "string"}, "to": {"type": "string"}, "trigger": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["from", "to"]}}, "status_meanings_internal": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["statuses_allowed", "status_meanings_internal"]}
  3. Draft a short, plain-language explanation that describes what each time entry status (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) means and how entries typically move between these statuses, suitable for inclusion as markdown content in the wiki, ensuring no sensitive data (such as salaries) is included.
     Approach: Combine and reconcile information from the documentation and technical findings from steps 1 and 2. For each status, write one or two concise, non-technical sentences explaining: who usually sets it, what it implies for the employee and for billing, and where it sits in the usual lifecycle. Organize the explanation in markdown with headings and bullet points, keeping it brief and clear. Validate that the text does not contain any salary or other sensitive personal data.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"markdown_content": {"type": "string"}, "contains_sensitive_data": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["markdown_content", "contains_sensitive_data"]}
  4. Identify the concrete technical mechanism (API, service function, or direct persistence interface) used to create or update wiki files backed by the wiki_file table, including how to set the path, content, and sha1 for a file such as systems/time_status_overview.md, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for function and service names.
     Approach: Search technical documentation and code (controllers, services, data-access layers) using fuzzy and semantic search for references to the wiki_file table and common wiki operations (e.g., functions such as save_wiki_file, update_wiki_page, or similar, including possible misspellings or abbreviations). Determine which interface is intended for chatbot-driven edits, what parameters it expects (path, content, optional sha1, etc.), and how it signals success or failure. Record whether a suitable write-capable interface exists.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"wiki_write_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "wiki_write_api_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "wiki_write_api_parameters": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["wiki_write_api_found", "wiki_write_api_name", "wiki_write_api_parameters"]}
  5. Verify the current user identity and permissions to write or update the wiki page at path systems/time_status_overview.md, using who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup and any wiki access control checks required.
     Approach: Call the identity and permission-checking mechanisms (for example, who_am_i combined with a backend wiki permission check) to confirm that the acting user (Laura Pellegrini, employee id ayEi_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy) is allowed to create or update wiki_file entries at the systems/ path. Ensure that the content from step 3 does not violate the rule against storing sensitive personal data such as individual salaries in the wiki.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_edit_target_wiki_path": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "can_edit_target_wiki_path"]}
  6. If a suitable wiki write API exists and the current user has permission, save the drafted explanation as a markdown file at path systems/time_status_overview.md in the wiki by creating or updating the corresponding wiki_file row.
     Approach: Using the API details from step 4 and the permission confirmation from step 5, invoke the wiki write operation with path set exactly to "systems/time_status_overview.md" and content set to the markdown text from step 3. Include or compute the sha1 value as required by the API contract. Handle potential errors returned by the API and confirm that the wiki_file entry has been successfully created or updated.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "write_success": {"type": "boolean"}, "sha1": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["path", "write_success"]}
  7. If step 4 determined that there is no implemented API or mechanism to write to wiki_file (wiki_write_api_found is false), formally abort the task as not implementable in the current system without attempting any write.
     Approach: Inspect the result of step 4. If wiki_write_api_found is false, register the task as aborted due to missing functionality, documenting that creating or updating systems/time_status_overview.md cannot be performed because no supported wiki write interface is available to the chatbot. Do not attempt any direct database writes or alternative workarounds.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"aborted": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["aborted", "reason"]}
