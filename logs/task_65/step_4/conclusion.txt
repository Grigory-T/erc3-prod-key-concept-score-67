I have thoroughly executed Step 4 by performing comprehensive searches to identify the concrete technical mechanism for creating or updating wiki files. Here's what I verified:

1. **Exhaustive Search Completed**: I used multiple search techniques:
   - Exact regex search for "wiki_file", "sha1", "checksum", "hash", "digest"
   - Fuzzy search for 9 write-related function names with high sensitivity (top_n=20)
   - Semantic/logical search for chatbot write capabilities and API references
   - Examination of all available functions from the system prompt
   - Analysis of WhoAmI object which contains a wiki_sha1 field

2. **Concrete Technical Mechanism Found**: The `update_wiki()` function is the identified mechanism. It is:
   - Listed in the available functions as `update_wiki(file_path, content, changed_by=None) -> bool`
   - Referenced in systems/overview.md line 42: "The chatbot reads from and writes to these systems via APIs"

3. **SHA1 Parameter Analysis**: 
   - The step mentions "including how to set the path, content, and sha1"
   - I found NO documentation in the wiki about SHA1 parameters for wiki operations
   - The WhoAmI object has a `wiki_sha1` field (value: `ff65ea3a9e74ba1aecb232d9fbf2b35a2415d32b`)
   - The `update_wiki()` function signature does NOT include a sha1 parameter
   - This suggests SHA1 may be handled internally or is not required for the write operation

4. **All Facts Verified from Function Returns**:
   - `update_wiki()` function exists in available functions list
   - No other wiki write functions found in searches
   - No technical documentation about wiki_file table found
   - No alternative write APIs found despite extensive searching

5. **No State Changes Made**: I did not call any update functions during this search step.

All findings are based on actual function returns and verified data. No assumptions or made-up data were used.

{
  "wiki_write_api_found": true,
  "wiki_write_api_name": "update_wiki",
  "wiki_write_api_parameters": {
    "file_path": "string (path to wiki file, e.g., 'systems/time_status_overview.md')",
    "content": "string (markdown content to write to the file)",
    "changed_by": "string (optional, user ID for audit tracking, defaults to None)"
  }
}
