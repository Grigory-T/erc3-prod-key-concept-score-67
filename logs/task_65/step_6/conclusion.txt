I have successfully executed Step 6 to save the drafted explanation as a markdown file in the wiki. Using the `update_wiki()` API identified in Step 4 and with the user permission confirmed in Step 5, I created/updated the file at path `systems/time_status_overview.md` with the markdown content from Step 3.

The operation was successful: `update_wiki()` returned `True`, and I verified the file was saved by loading it back and confirming it appears in the wiki file list. The content length matches exactly (2297 characters), confirming the file was properly saved.

The user Laura Pellegrini (ayEi_001) from Corporate Leadership successfully created this wiki file on 2025-08-06. The content does not contain any sensitive personal data as confirmed in Step 3.

State change performed: The wiki file `systems/time_status_overview.md` was created or updated with the new content via the `update_wiki()` function.
