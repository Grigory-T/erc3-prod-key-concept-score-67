Step 6: If a suitable wiki write API exists and the current user has permission, save the drafted explanation as a markdown file at path systems/time_status_overview.md in the wiki by creating or updating the corresponding wiki_file row.
Approach: Using the API details from step 4 and the permission confirmation from step 5, invoke the wiki write operation with path set exactly to "systems/time_status_overview.md" and content set to the markdown text from step 3. Include or compute the sha1 value as required by the API contract. Handle potential errors returned by the API and confirm that the wiki_file entry has been successfully created or updated.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "write_success": {"type": "boolean"}, "sha1": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["path", "write_success"]}
