STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:21:08

I have successfully executed Step 1 as instructed. I used multiple search techniques including:

1. **Exact regex search** for each status term ("draft", "submitted", "approved", "invoiced", "voided")
2. **Fuzzy search** with 14 related terms to handle ambiguous terms and misspellings
3. **Semantic/logical search** by checking likely paths (systems/, hr/, etc.) and common documentation files
4. **Pattern matching** for time-related workflows and processes
5. **Context extraction** from the main time tracking documentation file

All facts are verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data were used. I found 4 source documents and extracted relevant definitions for all 5 statuses. The main comprehensive definitions come from "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" which contains the complete lifecycle of time entries. No state-changing operations were performed during this search step.
