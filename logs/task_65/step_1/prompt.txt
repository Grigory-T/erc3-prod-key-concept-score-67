Step 1: Search the internal wiki and other company documentation for existing explanations or guidelines about time entry statuses ("draft", "submitted", "approved", "invoiced", "voided"), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle ambiguous terms, abbreviations, and possible misspellings, and extract any relevant definitions or descriptions.
Approach: Use wiki search tools (including fuzzy matching, partial matching, regex, and semantic / logical search) to look for pages and sections related to time tracking, time entries, or status workflows (for example, search terms like "time status", "time_entry status", "timesheet workflow"). If exact matches are not found, relax filters and use fuzzy and semantic search over page titles and content. Compile all found descriptions of each status and note their sources for later consolidation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"source_docs": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "status_definitions_raw": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["source_docs", "status_definitions_raw"]}
