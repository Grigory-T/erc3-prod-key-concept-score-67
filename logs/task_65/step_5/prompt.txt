Step 5: Verify the current user identity and permissions to write or update the wiki page at path systems/time_status_overview.md, using who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup and any wiki access control checks required.
Approach: Call the identity and permission-checking mechanisms (for example, who_am_i combined with a backend wiki permission check) to confirm that the acting user (Laura Pellegrini, employee id ayEi_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy) is allowed to create or update wiki_file entries at the systems/ path. Ensure that the content from step 3 does not violate the rule against storing sensitive personal data such as individual salaries in the wiki.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_edit_target_wiki_path": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "can_edit_target_wiki_path"]}
