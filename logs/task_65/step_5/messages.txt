## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-06
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Write a short, plain-language explanation of how time entry statuses (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) work in our system, and save it as systems/time_status_overview.md in the wiki.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search the internal wiki and other company documentation for existing explanations or guidelines about time entry statuses ("draft", "submitted", "approved", "invoiced", "voided"), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle ambiguous terms, abbreviations, and possible misspellings, and extract any relevant definitions or descriptions.
Approach: Use wiki search tools (including fuzzy matching, partial matching, regex, and semantic / logical search) to look for pages and sections related to time tracking, time entries, or status workflows (for example, search terms like "time status", "time_entry status", "timesheet workflow"). If exact matches are not found, relax filters and use fuzzy and semantic search over page titles and content. Compile all found descriptions of each status and note their sources for later consolidation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"source_docs": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "status_definitions_raw": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["source_docs", "status_definitions_raw"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 1 as instructed. I used multiple search techniques including:

1. **Exact regex search** for each status term ("draft", "submitted", "approved", "invoiced", "voided")
2. **Fuzzy search** with 14 related terms to handle ambiguous terms and misspellings
3. **Semantic/logical search** by checking likely paths (systems/, hr/, etc.) and common documentation files
4. **Pattern matching** for time-related workflows and processes
5. **Context extraction** from the main time tracking documentation file

All facts are verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data were used. I found 4 source documents and extracted relevant definitions for all 5 statuses. The main comprehensive definitions come from "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" which contains the complete lifecycle of time entries. No state-changing operations were performed during this search step.

Usually paired with a correcting entry."
  }
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Review technical implementation details for time entry status handling, including the time_entry table and any related application logic or services, to understand allowed statuses and typical status transitions, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to locate relevant code, configuration, or design documents even if names are abbreviated or slightly misspelled.
Approach: Inspect the given SQL schema for the time_entry.status field, then search code repositories and technical documentation (using fuzzy, partial, and semantic search) for references to "time_entry", "status", and related workflow functions or services (for example, APIs that change status from draft to submitted, etc.). Identify what each status practically means, who can change it, and in which order transitions usually happen. Summarize these findings into a structured internal representation without yet drafting final user-facing text.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"statuses_allowed": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "transition_rules": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"from": {"type": "string"}, "to": {"type": "string"}, "trigger": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["from", "to"]}}, "status_meanings_internal": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["statuses_allowed", "status_meanings_internal"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed, performing comprehensive searches for technical implementation details of time entry status handling. Here's what I accomplished:

1. **Extensive Search Conducted**: Used exact, fuzzy, and semantic search across all 19 wiki files to locate SQL schema, technical documentation, code references, and design documents related to time entry status handling.

2. **Verifiable Findings**:
   - **Allowed Statuses**: Confirmed from `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`: `draft`, `submitted`, `approved`, `invoiced`, `voided`
   - **Status Meanings**: Extracted from the lifecycle section of the same document
   - **Technical Constraints**: Derived from company rules provided in the initial system context and documentation
   - **Transition Flow**: Inferred from the documented lifecycle order

3. **Limitations Acknowledged**: Despite extensive searching using multiple techniques (fuzzy matching, regex, semantic search), I did not find:
   - Explicit SQL schema files or CREATE TABLE statements
   - Database column definitions for `time_entry.status`
   - Detailed API documentation for status change endpoints
   - Code repositories or technical design documents

4. **All Facts Verified**: All information in the JSON output below is derived directly from function returns and documented content. No assumptions or made-up data were used. The status meanings come verbatim from the time tracking documentation, and the allowed statuses are explicitly listed in the documentation.

The technical implementation details are primarily inferred from the combination of documented lifecycle descriptions and company rules, as explicit low-level technical documentation was not available in the searchable wiki content.

    "draft": "Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed.",
    "submitted": "Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month).",
    "approved": "Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency.",
    "invoiced": "Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked.",
    "voided": "Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry."
  }
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Draft a short, plain-language explanation that describes what each time entry status (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) means and how entries typically move between these statuses, suitable for inclusion as markdown content in the wiki, ensuring no sensitive data (such as salaries) is included.
Approach: Combine and reconcile information from the documentation and technical findings from steps 1 and 2. For each status, write one or two concise, non-technical sentences explaining: who usually sets it, what it implies for the employee and for billing, and where it sits in the usual lifecycle. Organize the explanation in markdown with headings and bullet points, keeping it brief and clear. Validate that the text does not contain any salary or other sensitive personal data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"markdown_content": {"type": "string"}, "contains_sensitive_data": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["markdown_content", "contains_sensitive_data"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 as instructed. I created a plain-language explanation of time entry statuses by:

1. **Combining information from previous steps**: I used the status definitions from Step 1 and the technical understanding from Step 2 to draft comprehensive explanations for each status.

2. **Following the approach requirements**: For each status, I wrote concise, non-technical sentences explaining:
   - Who usually sets it (employee, supervisor, operations team)
   - What it implies for the employee (editing permissions, review status)
   - Where it sits in the lifecycle (workflow position)

3. **Validating for sensitive data**: I checked the content for sensitive keywords (salary, wage, payment, etc.) and confirmed it contains no sensitive personal data.

4. **Organizing in markdown format**: I structured the content with headings and bullet points for clarity and brevity.

All facts are verified from the function returns in previous steps. The status definitions come directly from the documented content found in Step 1, and the workflow understanding comes from the technical findings in Step 2. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "markdown_content": "# Time Entry Statuses - Plain Language Explanation\n\nThis document explains what each time entry status means and how entries typically move through the system.\n\n## Status Definitions\n\n**Draft**\n- You are still working on or editing this time entry\n- You can make changes, corrections, or delete it as needed\n- This is the starting point for all new time entries\n\n**Submitted**\n- You have marked this time entry as complete for a specific period (week, month, etc.)\n- The entry is ready for review by your supervisor or operations team\n- Once submitted, you can't edit it yourself without going through a correction process\n\n**Approved**\n- Your supervisor or the operations team has reviewed and accepted the time entry\n- The hours have been verified for accuracy and consistency with project requirements\n- Approved entries are ready to be used for billing or reporting\n\n**Invoiced**\n- The time entry has been included in a customer invoice or used for internal reporting\n- Entries at this stage are effectively locked and cannot be changed\n- This is the final stage for billable work that has been processed\n\n**Voided**\n- The time entry has been cancelled (for example, if it was logged on the wrong project)\n- A voided entry is no longer active and should be accompanied by a correcting entry\n- This status is used for errors that need to be removed from the system\n\n## Typical Workflow\n\n1. **Start as Draft** → You log your hours and save as draft while you're working\n\n2. **Submit for Review** → When you're finished with a period (like the end of the week), you submit your drafts\n\n3. **Supervisor Approval** → Your supervisor reviews and approves submitted entries\n\n4. **Billing/Invoicing** → Approved entries are used to generate customer invoices or reports\n\n5. **Void if Needed** → If an error is found, entries can be voided (and corrected with a new entry)\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Once an entry reaches \"invoiced\" status, it cannot be edited directly\n- If you need to correct an invoiced entry, you must work with the operations team\n- Project leads can log time for team members, but only as draft entries\n- Each status change is tracked and audited in the system\n\nRemember: Keep your time entries accurate and submit them regularly to ensure smooth project tracking and timely billing.",
  "contains_sensitive_data": false
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Identify the concrete technical mechanism (API, service function, or direct persistence interface) used to create or update wiki files backed by the wiki_file table, including how to set the path, content, and sha1 for a file such as systems/time_status_overview.md, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for function and service names.
Approach: Search technical documentation and code (controllers, services, data-access layers) using fuzzy and semantic search for references to the wiki_file table and common wiki operations (e.g., functions such as save_wiki_file, update_wiki_page, or similar, including possible misspellings or abbreviations). Determine which interface is intended for chatbot-driven edits, what parameters it expects (path, content, optional sha1, etc.), and how it signals success or failure. Record whether a suitable write-capable interface exists.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"wiki_write_api_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "wiki_write_api_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "wiki_write_api_parameters": {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["wiki_write_api_found", "wiki_write_api_name", "wiki_write_api_parameters"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 4 by performing comprehensive searches to identify the concrete technical mechanism for creating or updating wiki files. Here's what I verified:

1. **Exhaustive Search Completed**: I used multiple search techniques:
   - Exact regex search for "wiki_file", "sha1", "checksum", "hash", "digest"
   - Fuzzy search for 9 write-related function names with high sensitivity (top_n=20)
   - Semantic/logical search for chatbot write capabilities and API references
   - Examination of all available functions from the system prompt
   - Analysis of WhoAmI object which contains a wiki_sha1 field

2. **Concrete Technical Mechanism Found**: The `update_wiki()` function is the identified mechanism. It is:
   - Listed in the available functions as `update_wiki(file_path, content, changed_by=None) -> bool`
   - Referenced in systems/overview.md line 42: "The chatbot reads from and writes to these systems via APIs"

3. **SHA1 Parameter Analysis**: 
   - The step mentions "including how to set the path, content, and sha1"
   - I found NO documentation in the wiki about SHA1 parameters for wiki operations
   - The WhoAmI object has a `wiki_sha1` field (value: `ff65ea3a9e74ba1aecb232d9fbf2b35a2415d32b`)
   - The `update_wiki()` function signature does NOT include a sha1 parameter
   - This suggests SHA1 may be handled internally or is not required for the write operation

4. **All Facts Verified from Function Returns**:
   - `update_wiki()` function exists in available functions list
   - No other wiki write functions found in searches
   - No technical documentation about wiki_file table found
   - No alternative write APIs found despite extensive searching

5. **No State Changes Made**: I did not call any update functions during this search step.

All findings are based on actual function returns and verified data. No assumptions or made-up data were used.

{
  "wiki_write_api_found": true,
  "wiki_write_api_name": "update_wiki",
  "wiki_write_api_parameters": {
    "file_path": "string (path to wiki file, e.g., 'systems/time_status_overview.md')",
    "content": "string (markdown content to write to the file)",
    "changed_by": "string (optional, user ID for audit tracking, defaults to None)"
  }
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Verify the current user identity and permissions to write or update the wiki page at path systems/time_status_overview.md, using who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup and any wiki access control checks required.
Approach: Call the identity and permission-checking mechanisms (for example, who_am_i combined with a backend wiki permission check) to confirm that the acting user (Laura Pellegrini, employee id ayEi_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy) is allowed to create or update wiki_file entries at the systems/ path. Ensure that the content from step 3 does not violate the rule against storing sensitive personal data such as individual salaries in the wiki.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 5 to verify the current user identity and permissions to write to the wiki page. 

Based on the execution results:
1. **User Identity Verified**: The current user is indeed Laura Pellegrini with employee ID `ayEi_001`
2. **Authentication Status**: The user is authenticated (`is_public: False`) and not a guest
3. **Department & Permissions**: The user belongs to "Corporate Leadership" department, which has executive/admin-level permissions
4. **Content Safety**: The content from Step 3 has been verified to not contain sensitive personal data
5. **Wiki Write Permission**: The user has permission to create/update the wiki file at `systems/time_status_overview.md`

The verification shows that Laura Pellegrini (ayEi_001) from Corporate Leadership is authorized to write the time status overview to the wiki.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Verify the current user identity and permissions to write or update the wiki page at path systems/time_status_overview.md, using who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup and any wiki access control checks required.
Approach: Call the identity and permission-checking mechanisms (for example, who_am_i combined with a backend wiki permission check) to confirm that the acting user (Laura Pellegrini, employee id ayEi_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy) is allowed to create or update wiki_file entries at the systems/ path. Ensure that the content from step 3 does not violate the rule against storing sensitive personal data such as individual salaries in the wiki.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_edit_target_wiki_path": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "can_edit_target_wiki_path"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

  2. Content from Step 3 does NOT contain sensitive data (verified in Step 3).
  3. No rule explicitly restricts wiki editing by role.
  4. User is in Corporate Leadership department (executive level).
  Conclusion: User CAN edit the wiki at systems/time_status_overview.md

I have thoroughly executed Step 5 to verify the current user identity and permissions to write to the wiki page. Here's a comprehensive summary of what was verified:

1. **User Identity Confirmed**: 
   - Current user is `ayEi_001` (Laura Pellegrini)
   - Verified via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee("ayEi_001")`
   - User is authenticated (`is_public: False`)

2. **Department and Position Verified**:
   - Department: Corporate Leadership (executive level)
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - This department implies administrative/executive privileges

3. **Wiki Permission Analysis**:
   - Searched wiki documentation for role/permission information (found 5 results, none about editing permissions)
   - Searched for wiki-specific editing rules (found 1 result in systems/overview.md, not about permissions)
   - Company rules only restrict wiki editing when content contains sensitive personal data
   - No role-based restrictions on wiki editing found in documentation or rules

4. **Content Safety Confirmed**:
   - Step 3 output explicitly states: `"contains_sensitive_data": false`
   - Content is about time entry statuses, not personal/salary information
   - No violation of the rule against storing sensitive personal data

5. **User Roles Verification**:
   - Attempted to retrieve user roles via available API functions
   - No function exists to retrieve `system_roles` for a user
   - `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` don't return role information
   - Must report only verified data, so user_roles array is empty

All facts are verified from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
