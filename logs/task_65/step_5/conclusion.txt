I have thoroughly executed Step 5 to verify the current user identity and permissions to write to the wiki page. Here's a comprehensive summary of what was verified:

1. **User Identity Confirmed**: 
   - Current user is `ayEi_001` (Laura Pellegrini)
   - Verified via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee("ayEi_001")`
   - User is authenticated (`is_public: False`)

2. **Department and Position Verified**:
   - Department: Corporate Leadership (executive level)
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - This department implies administrative/executive privileges

3. **Wiki Permission Analysis**:
   - Searched wiki documentation for role/permission information (found 5 results, none about editing permissions)
   - Searched for wiki-specific editing rules (found 1 result in systems/overview.md, not about permissions)
   - Company rules only restrict wiki editing when content contains sensitive personal data
   - No role-based restrictions on wiki editing found in documentation or rules

4. **Content Safety Confirmed**:
   - Step 3 output explicitly states: `"contains_sensitive_data": false`
   - Content is about time entry statuses, not personal/salary information
   - No violation of the rule against storing sensitive personal data

5. **User Roles Verification**:
   - Attempted to retrieve user roles via available API functions
   - No function exists to retrieve `system_roles` for a user
   - `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` don't return role information
   - Must report only verified data, so user_roles array is empty

All facts are verified from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "user_roles": [],
  "can_edit_target_wiki_path": true
}
