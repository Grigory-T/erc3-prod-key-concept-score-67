DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:21:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed successfully as per the original plan, yielding expected outputs (source documents and raw definitions for all relevant statuses). There are no discrepancies or missing data, and the results match the requirements. No unexpected results or roadblocks have occurred. Therefore, the plan is still valid, and progression to Step 2 is appropriate.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:32:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced expected and relevant results strictly according to the original plan. The allowed statuses, meanings, and transitions are fully clarified and there are no inconsistencies or unexpected gaps. The next logical action is to proceed to step 3, which requires drafting a user-facing, plain-language markdown summary using the information obtained. There is no need to replan or abort, as the task remains feasible and on track.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:34:56
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan has progressed correctly through Steps 1–3, each producing the expected, strictly defined outputs per the original plan. No errors, blockers, or inconsistencies have been returned; results contain exactly the required factual information. All facts are directly verified from documentation or technical results, and no assumptions are present. There is no evidence that a required function/API is missing, nor that the task is blocked. Therefore, according to the plan, the next logical action is to proceed to Step 4.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:40:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have returned the expected, relevant, and correct results as defined in the original plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing information. The technical mechanism for saving to the wiki is confirmed (update_wiki). No steps require replanning. Step 5 is needed next to verify user identity and permissions according to the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:46:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been successfully completed and validated in accordance with the Original Plan. Step 6 is the next step and can now be executed because: (1) the required wiki write API ('update_wiki') has been identified and its interface described; (2) the user (Laura Pellegrini, ayEi_001) has confirmed permissions to edit the target path; (3) the markdown content has been written and validated to contain no sensitive data. There are no discrepancies or missing information. The conditions to proceed are satisfied, so the plan remains valid and the next step should be executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:50:02
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The task is fully complete. All planned steps have been executed as per the original plan. Steps 1–6 have confirmed that source information was found, the user had authority, the necessary API exists, the file was written, and success was verified. Step 7 is only required if there is no wiki write API, but in Step 4 we found that the API exists, and in Step 6 the operation succeeded. There are no remaining steps. Task result matches the stated objective.
