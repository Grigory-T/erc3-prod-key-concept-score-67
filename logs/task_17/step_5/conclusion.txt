STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 20:32:54

I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. I filtered the 31 employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills (from Step 4) to identify those who also have strong 'Willingness to travel' will at level ≥ 7.

**Verification Details:**

1. **Exact Matching Attempt**: Initially searched for the exact will name "Willingness to travel" - found 0 employees with this exact name in their wills list.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all will names in employee records
   - Found that "will_travel" is the only travel-related will name in the system
   - This represents the same concept as "Willingness to travel" but uses the company's internal naming convention

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 (from Step 1 results) to the travel will.

4. **Results**: Found 9 employees who meet both criteria:
   - Strong QMS skill (level ≥ 7) AND
   - Strong travel will (level ≥ 7, found as "will_travel")

5. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each of the 31 QMS-qualified employees
   - Will names and levels were extracted from the `wills` list of each EmployeeFull object
   - Skill levels were verified from the `skills` list

6. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_level, travel_will_level (context-relevant subsets of skills and wills)

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.
