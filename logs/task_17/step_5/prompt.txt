Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.
