## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-10-09
Current actor: Authenticated user FphR_001
User details: {"id": "FphR_001", "name": "Nino Valente", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** We want to start training at key customer sites. Who would you recommend as primary trainer with strong Quality management systems and strong Willingness to travel?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify internal definitions and naming conventions for the 'Quality management systems' skill and the 'Willingness to travel' will in company documentation.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file repository and any company skill framework documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms like 'Quality management systems', 'QMS', 'quality mgmt', 'willingness to travel', 'travel readiness', and similar phrases, explicitly accounting for abbreviations, synonyms, spelling mistakes, and partial matches. Identify the canonical skill_name and will_name strings (or small set of acceptable variants) and any internal guidance on what constitutes a 'strong' level (for example, mapping to higher numeric levels such as 4 or 5), without adding any new rules beyond what is found.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"qms_skill_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "travel_will_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_level_threshold": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}}, "required": ["qms_skill_names", "travel_will_names", "strong_level_threshold"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I searched the internal wiki repository using fuzzy and semantic/logical search for the specified terms. Through multiple search methods (fuzzy search, regex patterns, and direct file examination), I verified the exact canonical names from company documentation:

1. **QMS Skill Name**: Found exactly "Quality management systems" in the `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` file, with the exact line: "- Quality management systems – 8"

2. **Travel Will Name**: Found exactly "Willingness to travel" in both the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` (as an example) and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files, with the exact line: "- Willingness to travel – 7"

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Found in the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` rating scale section that defines levels 7-8 as "Strong" (recognized expertise / strong motivation). The threshold for a "strong" level is therefore 7.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki files.

{
  "qms_skill_names": ["Quality management systems"],
  "travel_will_names": ["Willingness to travel"],
  "strong_level_threshold": 7
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data structures and access methods used to store employee skills and wills needed for this recommendation.
Approach: Review available database schemas and internal technical documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for entities related to employees, skills, and wills (for example, tables or services like 'employee', 'employee_skill', 'skill_type', 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table with skill_type in ('skill', 'will') is the authoritative source, and document which fields (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) will be queried. Ensure awareness that object names might contain typos or variations and account for this with fuzzy matching of entity names in documentation if needed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_storage_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}, "skill_entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "skill_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_storage_confirmed", "skill_entity_name", "skill_fields", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification, I found no evidence of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field in company documentation. Instead, the authoritative source for employee skills and wills is the Employee Registry, where each employee record contains two separate lists: "skills" and "wills", each consisting of SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields. Access methods include get_employee() to retrieve full records and search_employees() to filter by skill levels. The specific table structure mentioned in the step approach was not found in any technical documentation.

{
  "skill_storage_confirmed": false,
  "skill_entity_name": "Employee (Employee Registry record)",
  "skill_fields": ["employee_id", "name", "level"],
  "will_representation_confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify that the current user (Nino Valente) is authorized to read non-confidential fields of all EmployeeProfiles, specifically including name, email, location, department, and subset of skills and wills, for the purpose of trainer recommendation.
Approach: Retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry using who_am_i or equivalent. Review company authorization rules to check if reading non-confidential EmployeeProfile fields (excluding salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) for all employees is allowed. Confirm that this is permitted under both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules for the profile fields and context described in the task.
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I verified the current user's authorization to read non-confidential employee profile fields for trainer recommendation purposes.

**Verification Details:**
1. **Retrieved Current User Identity**: Used `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` to obtain:
   - User ID: FphR_001 (Nino Valente)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication Status: Authenticated (not public user)

2. **Reviewed Company Authorization Rules**: Examined both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules:
   - **Authenticated User Rules**: When accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}
   - **General Rules**: All authenticated users (employee_id ≠ null) have their identity bound from EmployeeRegistry

3. **Verified System Roles Access**: While system_roles are not directly exposed via available functions, the rules explicitly state that chatbot access to non-confidential fields is allowed for all authenticated users regardless of specific system roles.

4. **Confirmed Authorization for Trainer Recommendation**:
   - The task requires reading: name, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills
   - All these fields are in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES when accessed via chatbot
   - Confidential fields (salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) remain restricted

**All facts were verified from actual function returns:**
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `get_employee()` returned user details
- Company rules were reviewed from the provided documentation
- No assumptions were made - all conclusions based on explicit rules and function returns

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

{
  "user_identity": "FphR_001",
  "user_name": "Nino Valente",
  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "user_location": "HQ – Italy",
  "is_authenticated": true,
  "authorized_for_non_confidential_fields": true,
  "authorization_basis": "Authenticated User Rules allow chatbot access to {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)} for all authenticated users",
  "purpose_valid": "trainer recommendation requires context-relevant subsets of skills and wills"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all employees from the Employee Registry who have 'Quality management systems' as a skill with level greater than or equal to the strong_level_threshold (7). Include only the allowed fields for each employee and document their QMS skill name and level.
Approach: Use search_employees or equivalent helper function to filter Employee Registry records. Examine each employee's 'skills' list for the canonical skill name 'Quality management systems'. Only select those employees where their SkillLevel for this name is >= 7. For each, collect and return employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_name, and qms_skill_level. Apply relaxed matching (case-insensitive, partial match, fuzzy) only if exact matches yield no candidates.
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed, following the approach of applying relaxed matching when exact matches yielded no candidates.

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: Initially searched for employees with exact skill name "Quality management systems" - found 0 employees.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all 154 employees in the Employee Registry
   - Checking all 15 unique skill names in the company
   - Identifying that "skill_qms" is the only skill containing "qms" (common abbreviation for Quality Management Systems)
   - This aligns with the wiki documentation where "Quality management systems" appears as a canonical name

3. **Skill Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 from Step 1 results.

4. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` returned all 154 employees
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each employee
   - Skill names and levels were extracted from the `skills` list of each EmployeeFull object

5. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_name, qms_skill_level (context-relevant subset of skills)

6. **Results**: Found 31 employees with "skill_qms" at level ≥ 7.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. I filtered the 31 employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills (from Step 4) to identify those who also have strong 'Willingness to travel' will at level ≥ 7.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Exact Matching Attempt**: Initially searched for the exact will name "Willingness to travel" - found 0 employees with this exact name in their wills list.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all will names in employee records
   - Found that "will_travel" is the only travel-related will name in the system
   - This represents the same concept as "Willingness to travel" but uses the company's internal naming convention

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 (from Step 1 results) to the travel will.

4. **Results**: Found 9 employees who meet both criteria:
   - Strong QMS skill (level ≥ 7) AND
   - Strong travel will (level ≥ 7, found as "will_travel")

5. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each of the 31 QMS-qualified employees
   - Will names and levels were extracted from the `wills` list of each EmployeeFull object
   - Skill levels were verified from the `skills` list

6. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_level, travel_will_level (context-relevant subsets of skills and wills)

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I confirm that I executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each point in the checklist:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** YES
   - Filtered employees from Step 4 (31 with strong QMS skills)
   - Examined each employee's 'wills' list for 'Willingness to travel'
   - Selected those with level ≥ 7
   - Applied exact matching first, then relaxed to semantic/fuzzy matching when exact matches yielded 0 results

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** NO
   - All 31 employees were checked individually
   - No assumptions about will names - verified actual will names in employee records
   - No skipped verification steps

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** YES
   - All employee data came from `get_employee()` function returns
   - Will names and levels were extracted from actual `employee.wills` lists
   - Skill levels were verified from actual `employee.skills` lists
   - Email addresses were taken directly from `employee.email` fields

**Double-check of key findings:**
- Exact will name "Willingness to travel" → 0 matches (verified)
- Actual will name in system → "will_travel" (verified from unique will names set)
- 9 employees have "will_travel" at level ≥ 7 AND "skill_qms" at level ≥ 7 (verified)

**No state-changing operations performed** - only read operations using `get_employee()`.

All JSON values come directly from printed function returns. No data was invented or assumed.
