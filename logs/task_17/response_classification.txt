  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify internal definitions and naming conventions for the 'Quality management systems' skill and the 'Willingness to travel' will in company documentation.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file repository and any company skill framework documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms like 'Quality management systems', 'QMS', 'quality mgmt', 'willingness to travel', 'travel readiness', and similar phrases, explicitly accounting for abbreviations, synonyms, spelling mistakes, and partial matches. Identify the canonical skill_name and will_name strings (or small set of acceptable variants) and any internal guidance on what constitutes a 'strong' level (for example, mapping to higher numeric levels such as 4 or 5), without adding any new rules beyond what is found.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"qms_skill_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "travel_will_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_level_threshold": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}}, "required": ["qms_skill_names", "travel_will_names", "strong_level_threshold"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I searched the internal wiki repository using fuzzy and semantic/logical search for the specified terms. Through multiple search methods (fuzzy search, regex patterns, and direct file examination), I verified the exact canonical names from company documentation:

1. **QMS Skill Name**: Found exactly "Quality management systems" in the `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` file, with the exact line: "- Quality management systems – 8"

2. **Travel Will Name**: Found exactly "Willingness to travel" in both the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` (as an example) and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files, with the exact line: "- Willingness to travel – 7"

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Found in the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` rating scale section that defines levels 7-8 as "Strong" (recognized expertise / strong motivation). The threshold for a "strong" level is therefore 7.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki files.

{
  "qms_skill_names": ["Quality management systems"],
  "travel_will_names": ["Willingness to travel"],
  "strong_level_threshold": 7
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data structures and access methods used to store employee skills and wills needed for this recommendation.
Approach: Review available database schemas and internal technical documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for entities related to employees, skills, and wills (for example, tables or services like 'employee', 'employee_skill', 'skill_type', 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table with skill_type in ('skill', 'will') is the authoritative source, and document which fields (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) will be queried. Ensure awareness that object names might contain typos or variations and account for this with fuzzy matching of entity names in documentation if needed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_storage_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}, "skill_entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "skill_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_storage_confirmed", "skill_entity_name", "skill_fields", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification, I found no evidence of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field in company documentation. Instead, the authoritative source for employee skills and wills is the Employee Registry, where each employee record contains two separate lists: "skills" and "wills", each consisting of SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields. Access methods include get_employee() to retrieve full records and search_employees() to filter by skill levels. The specific table structure mentioned in the step approach was not found in any technical documentation.

{
  "skill_storage_confirmed": false,
  "skill_entity_name": "Employee (Employee Registry record)",
  "skill_fields": ["employee_id", "name", "level"],
  "will_representation_confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify that the current user (Nino Valente) is authorized to read non-confidential fields of all EmployeeProfiles, specifically including name, email, location, department, and subset of skills and wills, for the purpose of trainer recommendation.
Approach: Retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry using who_am_i or equivalent. Review company authorization rules to check if reading non-confidential EmployeeProfile fields (excluding salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) for all employees is allowed. Confirm that this is permitted under both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules for the profile fields and context described in the task.
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I verified the current user's authorization to read non-confidential employee profile fields for trainer recommendation purposes.

**Verification Details:**
1. **Retrieved Current User Identity**: Used `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` to obtain:
   - User ID: FphR_001 (Nino Valente)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication Status: Authenticated (not public user)

2. **Reviewed Company Authorization Rules**: Examined both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules:
   - **Authenticated User Rules**: When accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}
   - **General Rules**: All authenticated users (employee_id ≠ null) have their identity bound from EmployeeRegistry

3. **Verified System Roles Access**: While system_roles are not directly exposed via available functions, the rules explicitly state that chatbot access to non-confidential fields is allowed for all authenticated users regardless of specific system roles.

4. **Confirmed Authorization for Trainer Recommendation**:
   - The task requires reading: name, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills
   - All these fields are in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES when accessed via chatbot
   - Confidential fields (salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) remain restricted

**All facts were verified from actual function returns:**
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `get_employee()` returned user details
- Company rules were reviewed from the provided documentation
- No assumptions were made - all conclusions based on explicit rules and function returns

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

{
  "user_identity": "FphR_001",
  "user_name": "Nino Valente",
  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "user_location": "HQ – Italy",
  "is_authenticated": true,
  "authorized_for_non_confidential_fields": true,
  "authorization_basis": "Authenticated User Rules allow chatbot access to {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)} for all authenticated users",
  "purpose_valid": "trainer recommendation requires context-relevant subsets of skills and wills"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all employees from the Employee Registry who have 'Quality management systems' as a skill with level greater than or equal to the strong_level_threshold (7). Include only the allowed fields for each employee and document their QMS skill name and level.
Approach: Use search_employees or equivalent helper function to filter Employee Registry records. Examine each employee's 'skills' list for the canonical skill name 'Quality management systems'. Only select those employees where their SkillLevel for this name is >= 7. For each, collect and return employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_name, and qms_skill_level. Apply relaxed matching (case-insensitive, partial match, fuzzy) only if exact matches yield no candidates.
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed, following the approach of applying relaxed matching when exact matches yielded no candidates.

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: Initially searched for employees with exact skill name "Quality management systems" - found 0 employees.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all 154 employees in the Employee Registry
   - Checking all 15 unique skill names in the company
   - Identifying that "skill_qms" is the only skill containing "qms" (common abbreviation for Quality Management Systems)
   - This aligns with the wiki documentation where "Quality management systems" appears as a canonical name

3. **Skill Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 from Step 1 results.

4. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` returned all 154 employees
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each employee
   - Skill names and levels were extracted from the `skills` list of each EmployeeFull object

5. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_name, qms_skill_level (context-relevant subset of skills)

6. **Results**: Found 31 employees with "skill_qms" at level ≥ 7.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

    }
  ],
  "total_count": 31,
  "qms_skill_variant_found": "skill_qms",
  "strong_level_threshold_applied": 7,
  "note": "Exact matching on 'Quality management systems' yielded no results. Applied relaxed matching (partial match on 'qms') and found skill stored as 'skill_qms' in employee records."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.
**Result:** I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. I filtered the 31 employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills (from Step 4) to identify those who also have strong 'Willingness to travel' will at level ≥ 7.

**Verification Details:**

1. **Exact Matching Attempt**: Initially searched for the exact will name "Willingness to travel" - found 0 employees with this exact name in their wills list.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all will names in employee records
   - Found that "will_travel" is the only travel-related will name in the system
   - This represents the same concept as "Willingness to travel" but uses the company's internal naming convention

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 (from Step 1 results) to the travel will.

4. **Results**: Found 9 employees who meet both criteria:
   - Strong QMS skill (level ≥ 7) AND
   - Strong travel will (level ≥ 7, found as "will_travel")

5. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each of the 31 QMS-qualified employees
   - Will names and levels were extracted from the `wills` list of each EmployeeFull object
   - Skill levels were verified from the `skills` list

6. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_level, travel_will_level (context-relevant subsets of skills and wills)

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

}

### Step 6
Step 6: Rank and recommend the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel, producing the final recommendation.
Approach: Sort the trainer_candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) Willingness to travel level. In case of ties, include multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations if their levels are equivalent. Output the list of all qualified candidates and identify the employee_id(s) of the top recommended primary trainer(s) for assignment.
**Result:** I have executed Step 6 exactly as instructed. The step required ranking and recommending the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel.

**Verification against Checklist:**

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes, I:
   - Sorted trainer candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) descending travel will level
   - Identified top candidate(s) based on highest QMS level, then highest travel will level among those
   - Included multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations in case of ties (no ties existed at top level)
   - Output the list of all qualified candidates (9 candidates)
   - Identified employee_id(s) of top recommended primary trainer(s): ["FphR_002"]

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ✅ No, I performed all actions specified:
   - Used exact candidate data from Step 5 results (no assumptions)
   - Applied exact sorting logic as specified
   - Performed tie analysis as specified
   - No state-changing operations were needed or performed

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes, all facts were verified:
   - Candidate data came directly from Step 5 results (previously verified)
   - QMS skill levels and travel will levels were taken directly from candidate records
   - Sorting was computational based on verified data
   - No fuzzy matching was needed as data was already validated

**Data Source Verification:**
- All 9 candidates were taken directly from Step 5 output
- Each candidate's QMS skill level and travel will level were explicitly printed in the code execution results
- The ranking was performed based on these actual values
- No data was invented or assumed

**State Changes:**
- No state-changing operations were performed (no update functions called)
- Only read operations and data processing of existing candidate information

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.

Based on the agent's work below, classify the response.

## User (agent is acting on behalf of this User)
employee_id: FphR_001, is_public: False , department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy

## Original Task
We want to start training at key customer sites. Who would you recommend as primary trainer with strong Quality management systems and strong Willingness to travel?

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify internal definitions and naming conventions for the 'Quality management systems' skill and the 'Willingness to travel' will in company documentation.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file repository and any company skill framework documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms like 'Quality management systems', 'QMS', 'quality mgmt', 'willingness to travel', 'travel readiness', and similar phrases, explicitly accounting for abbreviations, synonyms, spelling mistakes, and partial matches. Identify the canonical skill_name and will_name strings (or small set of acceptable variants) and any internal guidance on what constitutes a 'strong' level (for example, mapping to higher numeric levels such as 4 or 5), without adding any new rules beyond what is found.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"qms_skill_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "travel_will_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_level_threshold": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}}, "required": ["qms_skill_names", "travel_will_names", "strong_level_threshold"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I searched the internal wiki repository using fuzzy and semantic/logical search for the specified terms. Through multiple search methods (fuzzy search, regex patterns, and direct file examination), I verified the exact canonical names from company documentation:

1. **QMS Skill Name**: Found exactly "Quality management systems" in the `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` file, with the exact line: "- Quality management systems – 8"

2. **Travel Will Name**: Found exactly "Willingness to travel" in both the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` (as an example) and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files, with the exact line: "- Willingness to travel – 7"

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Found in the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` rating scale section that defines levels 7-8 as "Strong" (recognized expertise / strong motivation). The threshold for a "strong" level is therefore 7.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki files.

{
  "qms_skill_names": ["Quality management systems"],
  "travel_will_names": ["Willingness to travel"],
  "strong_level_threshold": 7
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data structures and access methods used to store employee skills and wills needed for this recommendation.
Approach: Review available database schemas and internal technical documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for entities related to employees, skills, and wills (for example, tables or services like 'employee', 'employee_skill', 'skill_type', 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table with skill_type in ('skill', 'will') is the authoritative source, and document which fields (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) will be queried. Ensure awareness that object names might contain typos or variations and account for this with fuzzy matching of entity names in documentation if needed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_storage_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}, "skill_entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "skill_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_storage_confirmed", "skill_entity_name", "skill_fields", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification, I found no evidence of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field in company documentation. Instead, the authoritative source for employee skills and wills is the Employee Registry, where each employee record contains two separate lists: "skills" and "wills", each consisting of SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields. Access methods include get_employee() to retrieve full records and search_employees() to filter by skill levels. The specific table structure mentioned in the step approach was not found in any technical documentation.

{
  "skill_storage_confirmed": false,
  "skill_entity_name": "Employee (Employee Registry record)",
  "skill_fields": ["employee_id", "name", "level"],
  "will_representation_confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify that the current user (Nino Valente) is authorized to read non-confidential fields of all EmployeeProfiles, specifically including name, email, location, department, and subset of skills and wills, for the purpose of trainer recommendation.
Approach: Retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry using who_am_i or equivalent. Review company authorization rules to check if reading non-confidential EmployeeProfile fields (excluding salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) for all employees is allowed. Confirm that this is permitted under both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules for the profile fields and context described in the task.
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I verified the current user's authorization to read non-confidential employee profile fields for trainer recommendation purposes.

**Verification Details:**
1. **Retrieved Current User Identity**: Used `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` to obtain:
   - User ID: FphR_001 (Nino Valente)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication Status: Authenticated (not public user)

2. **Reviewed Company Authorization Rules**: Examined both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules:
   - **Authenticated User Rules**: When accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}
   - **General Rules**: All authenticated users (employee_id ≠ null) have their identity bound from EmployeeRegistry

3. **Verified System Roles Access**: While system_roles are not directly exposed via available functions, the rules explicitly state that chatbot access to non-confidential fields is allowed for all authenticated users regardless of specific system roles.

4. **Confirmed Authorization for Trainer Recommendation**:
   - The task requires reading: name, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills
   - All these fields are in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES when accessed via chatbot
   - Confidential fields (salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) remain restricted

**All facts were verified from actual function returns:**
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `get_employee()` returned user details
- Company rules were reviewed from the provided documentation
- No assumptions were made - all conclusions based on explicit rules and function returns

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

{
  "user_identity": "FphR_001",
  "user_name": "Nino Valente",
  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "user_location": "HQ – Italy",
  "is_authenticated": true,
  "authorized_for_non_confidential_fields": true,
  "authorization_basis": "Authenticated User Rules allow chatbot access to {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)} for all authenticated users",
  "purpose_valid": "trainer recommendation requires context-relevant subsets of skills and wills"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all employees from the Employee Registry who have 'Quality management systems' as a skill with level greater than or equal to the strong_level_threshold (7). Include only the allowed fields for each employee and document their QMS skill name and level.
Approach: Use search_employees or equivalent helper function to filter Employee Registry records. Examine each employee's 'skills' list for the canonical skill name 'Quality management systems'. Only select those employees where their SkillLevel for this name is >= 7. For each, collect and return employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_name, and qms_skill_level. Apply relaxed matching (case-insensitive, partial match, fuzzy) only if exact matches yield no candidates.
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed, following the approach of applying relaxed matching when exact matches yielded no candidates.

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: Initially searched for employees with exact skill name "Quality management systems" - found 0 employees.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all 154 employees in the Employee Registry
   - Checking all 15 unique skill names in the company
   - Identifying that "skill_qms" is the only skill containing "qms" (common abbreviation for Quality Management Systems)
   - This aligns with the wiki documentation where "Quality management systems" appears as a canonical name

3. **Skill Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 from Step 1 results.

4. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` returned all 154 employees
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each employee
   - Skill names and levels were extracted from the `skills` list of each EmployeeFull object

5. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)

}

### Step 5
Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.
**Result:** I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. I filtered the 31 employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills (from Step 4) to identify those who also have strong 'Willingness to travel' will at level ≥ 7.

**Verification Details:**

1. **Exact Matching Attempt**: Initially searched for the exact will name "Willingness to travel" - found 0 employees with this exact name in their wills list.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all will names in employee records
   - Found that "will_travel" is the only travel-related will name in the system
   - This represents the same concept as "Willingness to travel" but uses the company's internal naming convention

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 (from Step 1 results) to the travel will.

4. **Results**: Found 9 employees who meet both criteria:
   - Strong QMS skill (level ≥ 7) AND
   - Strong travel will (level ≥ 7, found as "will_travel")

5. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each of the 31 QMS-qualified employees
   - Will names and levels were extracted from the `wills` list of each EmployeeFull object
   - Skill levels were verified from the `skills` list

6. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_level, travel_will_level (context-relevant subsets of skills and wills)

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

}

### Step 6
Step 6: Rank and recommend the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel, producing the final recommendation.
Approach: Sort the trainer_candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) Willingness to travel level. In case of ties, include multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations if their levels are equivalent. Output the list of all qualified candidates and identify the employee_id(s) of the top recommended primary trainer(s) for assignment.
**Result:** I have executed Step 6 exactly as instructed. The step required ranking and recommending the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel.

**Verification against Checklist:**

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes, I:
   - Sorted trainer candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) descending travel will level
   - Identified top candidate(s) based on highest QMS level, then highest travel will level among those
   - Included multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations in case of ties (no ties existed at top level)
   - Output the list of all qualified candidates (9 candidates)
   - Identified employee_id(s) of top recommended primary trainer(s): ["FphR_002"]

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ✅ No, I performed all actions specified:
   - Used exact candidate data from Step 5 results (no assumptions)
   - Applied exact sorting logic as specified
   - Performed tie analysis as specified
   - No state-changing operations were needed or performed

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes, all facts were verified:
   - Candidate data came directly from Step 5 results (previously verified)
   - QMS skill levels and travel will levels were taken directly from candidate records
   - Sorting was computational based on verified data
   - No fuzzy matching was needed as data was already validated

**Data Source Verification:**
- All 9 candidates were taken directly from Step 5 output
- Each candidate's QMS skill level and travel will level were explicitly printed in the code execution results
- The ranking was performed based on these actual values
- No data was invented or assumed

**State Changes:**
- No state-changing operations were performed (no update functions called)
- Only read operations and data processing of existing candidate information

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.

Selection was performed exactly as requested, using only eligible non-confidential employee fields and canonical/variant skill & will names ('skill_qms', 'will_travel') with proper level thresholds (>=7) per company definitions. No unauthorized fields were used. The plan is complete and no further steps are required.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-10-09
Current actor: Authenticated user FphR_001
User details: {"id": "FphR_001", "name": "Nino Valente", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
