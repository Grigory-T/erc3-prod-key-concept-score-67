Step 6: Rank and recommend the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel, producing the final recommendation.
Approach: Sort the trainer_candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) Willingness to travel level. In case of ties, include multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations if their levels are equivalent. Output the list of all qualified candidates and identify the employee_id(s) of the top recommended primary trainer(s) for assignment.
