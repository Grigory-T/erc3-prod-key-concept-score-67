Step 4: Retrieve all employees from the Employee Registry who have 'Quality management systems' as a skill with level greater than or equal to the strong_level_threshold (7). Include only the allowed fields for each employee and document their QMS skill name and level.
Approach: Use search_employees or equivalent helper function to filter Employee Registry records. Examine each employee's 'skills' list for the canonical skill name 'Quality management systems'. Only select those employees where their SkillLevel for this name is >= 7. For each, collect and return employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_name, and qms_skill_level. Apply relaxed matching (case-insensitive, partial match, fuzzy) only if exact matches yield no candidates.
