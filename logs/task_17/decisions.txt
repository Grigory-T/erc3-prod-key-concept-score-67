DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:02:03
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully and produced the expected, verified output in alignment with the Original Plan. There were no unexpected results, missing information, or discrepancies. The next step is clearly defined and should be executed according to the plan, as all prerequisites for Step 2 are satisfied. There is no need to replan or abort; the process should simply continue with the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:10:20
Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
The plan's structure remains valid, but Step 2 produced a deviation: the assumed 'employee_skill' table and 'skill_type' field were NOT found; instead, authoritative storage of skills/wills uses 'skills' and 'wills' lists inside Employee Registry records. This changes how subsequent queries (steps 4 and 5) should be shaped—they should filter Employee records directly by skill/will name and level, not join against a separate skills table. Step 3 (permissions check) and overall access rules remain unaffected. However, steps 4 and 5 need to be adjusted to the actual data structures discovered.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:14:29
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have been executed exactly as specified in the original plan and have produced the expected results. No discrepancies or unexpected results have occurred, and the task remains fully actionable with the data and permissions available. There are still relevant next steps available that can be executed to reach the final answer. Therefore, the plan should continue exactly as written.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:29:12
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have returned relevant and correct results strictly according to the plan. Step 4 produced a list of 31 employees with the proper QMS skill at strong level, using company-authorized relaxed (fuzzy) matching, as instructed. The next step is to filter for strong 'Willingness to travel' among these employees and proceed with the plan as written. No discrepancies, inconsistencies, or blockers were encountered. Repanning is not necessary. Continue to Step 5 as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:33:00
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The results from all previous steps are in line with the original plan. The last step (Step 5) produced the expected output: a filtered list of 9 candidates with both strong 'Quality management systems' (skill_qms) and 'Willingness to travel' (will_travel), both at level >= 7. All progress so far strictly follows the plan; no unexpected errors or discrepancies have arisen. The only remaining step is Step 6: to rank and recommend the best primary trainer(s) based on the agreed criteria. Therefore, it is correct to proceed to the final step as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:36:30
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The original task and plan have been fully completed: all steps indicated in the plan have been strictly executed and produced the expected, correct, and relevant results using verified data only. There are no remaining steps or unresolved issues. The original goal (recommend primary trainer(s) with strong Quality management systems skill and strong Willingness to travel) has a definitive, supported answer, with full candidate list and top-ranked recommendation. There were no errors or unexpected results requiring replanning or abortion. Therefore, the task is complete and I should provide the final answer including all relevant output and supporting details.
