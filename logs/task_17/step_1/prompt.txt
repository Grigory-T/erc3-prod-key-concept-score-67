Step 1: Clarify internal definitions and naming conventions for the 'Quality management systems' skill and the 'Willingness to travel' will in company documentation.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file repository and any company skill framework documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms like 'Quality management systems', 'QMS', 'quality mgmt', 'willingness to travel', 'travel readiness', and similar phrases, explicitly accounting for abbreviations, synonyms, spelling mistakes, and partial matches. Identify the canonical skill_name and will_name strings (or small set of acceptable variants) and any internal guidance on what constitutes a 'strong' level (for example, mapping to higher numeric levels such as 4 or 5), without adding any new rules beyond what is found.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"qms_skill_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "travel_will_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_level_threshold": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}}, "required": ["qms_skill_names", "travel_will_names", "strong_level_threshold"]}
