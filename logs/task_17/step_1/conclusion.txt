I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I searched the internal wiki repository using fuzzy and semantic/logical search for the specified terms. Through multiple search methods (fuzzy search, regex patterns, and direct file examination), I verified the exact canonical names from company documentation:

1. **QMS Skill Name**: Found exactly "Quality management systems" in the `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` file, with the exact line: "- Quality management systems – 8"

2. **Travel Will Name**: Found exactly "Willingness to travel" in both the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` (as an example) and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files, with the exact line: "- Willingness to travel – 7"

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Found in the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` rating scale section that defines levels 7-8 as "Strong" (recognized expertise / strong motivation). The threshold for a "strong" level is therefore 7.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki files.

{
  "qms_skill_names": ["Quality management systems"],
  "travel_will_names": ["Willingness to travel"],
  "strong_level_threshold": 7
}
