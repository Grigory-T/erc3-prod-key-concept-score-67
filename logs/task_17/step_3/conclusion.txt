I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I verified the current user's authorization to read non-confidential employee profile fields for trainer recommendation purposes.

**Verification Details:**
1. **Retrieved Current User Identity**: Used `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` to obtain:
   - User ID: FphR_001 (Nino Valente)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication Status: Authenticated (not public user)

2. **Reviewed Company Authorization Rules**: Examined both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules:
   - **Authenticated User Rules**: When accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}
   - **General Rules**: All authenticated users (employee_id ≠ null) have their identity bound from EmployeeRegistry

3. **Verified System Roles Access**: While system_roles are not directly exposed via available functions, the rules explicitly state that chatbot access to non-confidential fields is allowed for all authenticated users regardless of specific system roles.

4. **Confirmed Authorization for Trainer Recommendation**:
   - The task requires reading: name, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills
   - All these fields are in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES when accessed via chatbot
   - Confidential fields (salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) remain restricted

**All facts were verified from actual function returns:**
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `get_employee()` returned user details
- Company rules were reviewed from the provided documentation
- No assumptions were made - all conclusions based on explicit rules and function returns

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.
