Step 3: Verify that the current user (Nino Valente) is authorized to read non-confidential fields of all EmployeeProfiles, specifically including name, email, location, department, and subset of skills and wills, for the purpose of trainer recommendation.
Approach: Retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry using who_am_i or equivalent. Review company authorization rules to check if reading non-confidential EmployeeProfile fields (excluding salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) for all employees is allowed. Confirm that this is permitted under both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules for the profile fields and context described in the task.
