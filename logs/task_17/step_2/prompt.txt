Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data structures and access methods used to store employee skills and wills needed for this recommendation.
Approach: Review available database schemas and internal technical documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for entities related to employees, skills, and wills (for example, tables or services like 'employee', 'employee_skill', 'skill_type', 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table with skill_type in ('skill', 'will') is the authoritative source, and document which fields (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) will be queried. Ensure awareness that object names might contain typos or variations and account for this with fuzzy matching of entity names in documentation if needed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_storage_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}, "skill_entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "skill_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_storage_confirmed", "skill_entity_name", "skill_fields", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
