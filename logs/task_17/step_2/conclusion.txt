After thorough verification, I found no evidence of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field in company documentation. Instead, the authoritative source for employee skills and wills is the Employee Registry, where each employee record contains two separate lists: "skills" and "wills", each consisting of SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields. Access methods include get_employee() to retrieve full records and search_employees() to filter by skill levels. The specific table structure mentioned in the step approach was not found in any technical documentation.

{
  "skill_storage_confirmed": false,
  "skill_entity_name": "Employee (Employee Registry record)",
  "skill_fields": ["employee_id", "name", "level"],
  "will_representation_confirmed": true
}
