## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify internal definitions and naming conventions for the 'Quality management systems' skill and the 'Willingness to travel' will in company documentation.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file repository and any company skill framework documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms like 'Quality management systems', 'QMS', 'quality mgmt', 'willingness to travel', 'travel readiness', and similar phrases, explicitly accounting for abbreviations, synonyms, spelling mistakes, and partial matches. Identify the canonical skill_name and will_name strings (or small set of acceptable variants) and any internal guidance on what constitutes a 'strong' level (for example, mapping to higher numeric levels such as 4 or 5), without adding any new rules beyond what is found.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"qms_skill_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "travel_will_names": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "strong_level_threshold": {"type": ["integer", "null"]}}, "required": ["qms_skill_names", "travel_will_names", "strong_level_threshold"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I searched the internal wiki repository using fuzzy and semantic/logical search for the specified terms. Through multiple search methods (fuzzy search, regex patterns, and direct file examination), I verified the exact canonical names from company documentation:

1. **QMS Skill Name**: Found exactly "Quality management systems" in the `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` file, with the exact line: "- Quality management systems – 8"

2. **Travel Will Name**: Found exactly "Willingness to travel" in both the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` (as an example) and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files, with the exact line: "- Willingness to travel – 7"

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Found in the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` rating scale section that defines levels 7-8 as "Strong" (recognized expertise / strong motivation). The threshold for a "strong" level is therefore 7.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki files.

{
  "qms_skill_names": ["Quality management systems"],
  "travel_will_names": ["Willingness to travel"],
  "strong_level_threshold": 7
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify and confirm the technical data structures and access methods used to store employee skills and wills needed for this recommendation.
Approach: Review available database schemas and internal technical documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for entities related to employees, skills, and wills (for example, tables or services like 'employee', 'employee_skill', 'skill_type', 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table with skill_type in ('skill', 'will') is the authoritative source, and document which fields (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) will be queried. Ensure awareness that object names might contain typos or variations and account for this with fuzzy matching of entity names in documentation if needed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"skill_storage_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}, "skill_entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "skill_fields": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "will_representation_confirmed": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["skill_storage_confirmed", "skill_entity_name", "skill_fields", "will_representation_confirmed"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification, I found no evidence of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field in company documentation. Instead, the authoritative source for employee skills and wills is the Employee Registry, where each employee record contains two separate lists: "skills" and "wills", each consisting of SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields. Access methods include get_employee() to retrieve full records and search_employees() to filter by skill levels. The specific table structure mentioned in the step approach was not found in any technical documentation.

{
  "skill_storage_confirmed": false,
  "skill_entity_name": "Employee (Employee Registry record)",
  "skill_fields": ["employee_id", "name", "level"],
  "will_representation_confirmed": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Verify that the current user (Nino Valente) is authorized to read non-confidential fields of all EmployeeProfiles, specifically including name, email, location, department, and subset of skills and wills, for the purpose of trainer recommendation.
Approach: Retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry using who_am_i or equivalent. Review company authorization rules to check if reading non-confidential EmployeeProfile fields (excluding salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) for all employees is allowed. Confirm that this is permitted under both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules for the profile fields and context described in the task.
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I verified the current user's authorization to read non-confidential employee profile fields for trainer recommendation purposes.

**Verification Details:**
1. **Retrieved Current User Identity**: Used `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()` to obtain:
   - User ID: FphR_001 (Nino Valente)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication Status: Authenticated (not public user)

2. **Reviewed Company Authorization Rules**: Examined both Authenticated User Rules and General Rules:
   - **Authenticated User Rules**: When accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes: {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)}
   - **General Rules**: All authenticated users (employee_id ≠ null) have their identity bound from EmployeeRegistry

3. **Verified System Roles Access**: While system_roles are not directly exposed via available functions, the rules explicitly state that chatbot access to non-confidential fields is allowed for all authenticated users regardless of specific system roles.

4. **Confirmed Authorization for Trainer Recommendation**:
   - The task requires reading: name, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills
   - All these fields are in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES when accessed via chatbot
   - Confidential fields (salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers) remain restricted

**All facts were verified from actual function returns:**
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `get_employee()` returned user details
- Company rules were reviewed from the provided documentation
- No assumptions were made - all conclusions based on explicit rules and function returns

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

{
  "user_identity": "FphR_001",
  "user_name": "Nino Valente",
  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "user_location": "HQ – Italy",
  "is_authenticated": true,
  "authorized_for_non_confidential_fields": true,
  "authorization_basis": "Authenticated User Rules allow chatbot access to {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)} for all authenticated users",
  "purpose_valid": "trainer recommendation requires context-relevant subsets of skills and wills"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all employees from the Employee Registry who have 'Quality management systems' as a skill with level greater than or equal to the strong_level_threshold (7). Include only the allowed fields for each employee and document their QMS skill name and level.
Approach: Use search_employees or equivalent helper function to filter Employee Registry records. Examine each employee's 'skills' list for the canonical skill name 'Quality management systems'. Only select those employees where their SkillLevel for this name is >= 7. For each, collect and return employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_name, and qms_skill_level. Apply relaxed matching (case-insensitive, partial match, fuzzy) only if exact matches yield no candidates.
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed, following the approach of applying relaxed matching when exact matches yielded no candidates.

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: Initially searched for employees with exact skill name "Quality management systems" - found 0 employees.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all 154 employees in the Employee Registry
   - Checking all 15 unique skill names in the company
   - Identifying that "skill_qms" is the only skill containing "qms" (common abbreviation for Quality Management Systems)
   - This aligns with the wiki documentation where "Quality management systems" appears as a canonical name

3. **Skill Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 from Step 1 results.

4. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` returned all 154 employees
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each employee
   - Skill names and levels were extracted from the `skills` list of each EmployeeFull object

5. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_name, qms_skill_level (context-relevant subset of skills)

6. **Results**: Found 31 employees with "skill_qms" at level ≥ 7.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

}

### Step 5
Step 5: Among employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills, further filter to those with 'Willingness to travel' will at strong level (>= 7) and identify trainer candidates.
Approach: For each employee returned in candidates_qms, examine their 'wills' list for the canonical will name 'Willingness to travel'. Select those with level >= 7. For each matching employee, record their employee_id, name, email, location, department, qms_skill_level, and travel_will_level. Use only exact skill and will names unless insufficient results, then relax to semantic/fuzzy match if needed.
**Result:** I have executed Step 5 exactly as instructed. I filtered the 31 employees with strong 'Quality management systems' skills (from Step 4) to identify those who also have strong 'Willingness to travel' will at level ≥ 7.

**Verification Details:**

1. **Exact Matching Attempt**: Initially searched for the exact will name "Willingness to travel" - found 0 employees with this exact name in their wills list.

2. **Relaxed Matching Applied**: Since no exact matches were found, I applied relaxed matching by:
   - Examining all will names in employee records
   - Found that "will_travel" is the only travel-related will name in the system
   - This represents the same concept as "Willingness to travel" but uses the company's internal naming convention

3. **Strong Level Threshold**: Applied the strong_level_threshold of 7 (from Step 1 results) to the travel will.

4. **Results**: Found 9 employees who meet both criteria:
   - Strong QMS skill (level ≥ 7) AND
   - Strong travel will (level ≥ 7, found as "will_travel")

5. **Data Verification**: All data was obtained directly from function returns:
   - `get_employee()` returned full details for each of the 31 QMS-qualified employees
   - Will names and levels were extracted from the `wills` list of each EmployeeFull object
   - Skill levels were verified from the `skills` list

6. **Field Restrictions**: Collected only allowed fields per Authenticated User Rules:
   - employee_id, name, email, location, department (non-confidential fields)
   - qms_skill_level, travel_will_level (context-relevant subsets of skills and wills)

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on employee records.

### Step 6
Step 6: Rank and recommend the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel, producing the final recommendation.
Approach: Sort the trainer_candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) Willingness to travel level. In case of ties, include multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations if their levels are equivalent. Output the list of all qualified candidates and identify the employee_id(s) of the top recommended primary trainer(s) for assignment.
**Result:** I have executed Step 6 exactly as instructed. The step required ranking and recommending the best primary trainer(s) based on the combination of QMS skill level and Willingness to travel.

**Verification against Checklist:**

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes, I:
   - Sorted trainer candidates by descending QMS skill level and (as secondary ranking) descending travel will level
   - Identified top candidate(s) based on highest QMS level, then highest travel will level among those
   - Included multiple candidates as co-primary recommendations in case of ties (no ties existed at top level)
   - Output the list of all qualified candidates (9 candidates)
   - Identified employee_id(s) of top recommended primary trainer(s): ["FphR_002"]

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ✅ No, I performed all actions specified:
   - Used exact candidate data from Step 5 results (no assumptions)
   - Applied exact sorting logic as specified
   - Performed tie analysis as specified
   - No state-changing operations were needed or performed

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes, all facts were verified:
   - Candidate data came directly from Step 5 results (previously verified)
   - QMS skill levels and travel will levels were taken directly from candidate records
   - Sorting was computational based on verified data
   - No fuzzy matching was needed as data was already validated

**Data Source Verification:**
- All 9 candidates were taken directly from Step 5 output
- Each candidate's QMS skill level and travel will level were explicitly printed in the code execution results
- The ranking was performed based on these actual values
- No data was invented or assumed

**State Changes:**
- No state-changing operations were performed (no update functions called)
- Only read operations and data processing of existing candidate information

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.
