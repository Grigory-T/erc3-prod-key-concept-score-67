Completed: 2025-12-10 00:41:24

I have re-verified Step 5 execution against the checklist:

1. **Step Instruction Executed**: Yes, I called `who_am_i()` to get user context, retrieved employee profile via `get_employee()`, retrieved project details via `get_project()`, and analyzed permissions based on company rules.

2. **No Actions Skipped or Assumed**: All facts were verified through function returns:
   - User ID, department, location from `who_am_i()` 
   - Employee details from `get_employee("QR23_001")`
   - Project details and team structure from `get_project("proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface")`
   - Project lead identification by checking team member roles

3. **All Facts Verified**:
   - Current user: Antonio Esposito (QR23_001), Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy (printed)
   - Project exists: proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface, "Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line" (printed)
   - Project lead: QR23_013 (Daniele Lombardi), not current user (printed)
   - Department "Corporate Leadership" confirmed as executive level (from company rules)
   - No system_roles field available in API - used department-based inference per company rules

4. **No State Changes**: Only read operations performed.

5. **JSON Values from Verified Data**:
   - current_user_id: "QR23_001" (from `who_am_i().current_user`)
   - current_user_department: "Corporate Leadership" (from `who_am_i().department` and `get_employee().department`)
   - current_user_roles: [] (system_roles not available in API, cannot retrieve)
   - project_id: "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface" (from Step 3, verified via `get_project()`)
   - has_modify_workload_permission: true (based on department being Corporate Leadership = executive)
   - permission_reason: Verified from company rules stating executives can perform any project operations

All values in JSON are explicitly derived from function returns and company rules. No assumptions or made-up data.
