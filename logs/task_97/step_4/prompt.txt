Step 4: Identify the employees 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia' and their existing workloads on the identified project.
Approach: Using the employee table, search for employees with names matching 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia'. Start with exact full-name matches; if not found, use case-normalized substring search and then fuzzy matching on the name field to handle possible variations (for example, 'Daniele L.', 'Lombardo', 'Silvia Grimaldi'). This search must be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL. After determining the most likely employee_id for each person, query the workload entity identified in step 2 (for example, team_member) for rows where project_id equals the selected_project_id from step 3 and employee_id equals each of the identified employees. Retrieve their current workload values (for example, time_slice). Do not modify any data in this step; only read and assemble the current state, even if one or both employees are not yet on the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"requested_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_score":{"type":["number","null"]},"canonical_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["requested_name","employee_id","found"]}},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"current_workload_value":{"type":["number","null"]},"workload_row_id":{"type":["integer","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","project_id"]}},"both_workloads_present":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employees","workloads","both_workloads_present"]}
