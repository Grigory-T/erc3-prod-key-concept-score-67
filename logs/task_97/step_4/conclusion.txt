STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

I have successfully completed Step 4 by identifying the employees 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia' and their existing workloads on the project. Through a systematic search approach including exact matching, substring matching, and fuzzy matching, I found:

1. **Daniele Lombardi**: Found as employee ID `QR23_013` with canonical name "Daniele Lombardi". He is currently on the project team with a time_slice (workload) of 0.3.

2. **Grimaldi Silvia**: Found as employee ID `QR23_039` with canonical name "Silvia Grimaldi". The search revealed that the name in the system is in "Firstname Lastname" order ("Silvia Grimaldi"), not "Lastname Firstname" as requested. She is currently on the project team with a time_slice of 0.4.

Both employees are confirmed to be team members on project `proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface` (Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line), and both have current workload values (time_slice allocations). No data was modified during this step - only read operations were performed.
