## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-23
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001
User details: {"id": "QR23_001", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided

## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Help me cleanup the mess at pre-treatment and e-coat interface project for CentraleAuto Stamping. Swap workloads of Daniele Lombardi and Grimaldi Silvia (fix earlier entry mistake).

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify what the user means by the 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface project for CentraleAuto Stamping' and by 'swap workloads' (for example, confirm that workload refers to team member time_slice allocation on the project, not time_entry hours) by searching internal wiki and documentation.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the wiki_file table and any internal documentation indexes for terms like 'pre-treatment', 'e-coat', 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface', and 'CentraleAuto Stamping'. Also search for internal process documentation or glossary entries describing 'workload', 'team workload', or 'time_slice' to map the business term 'workload' to the correct technical concept (for example, team_member.time_slice versus time_entry.hours). If multiple meanings are found, choose the one explicitly linked to project planning or capacity allocation. Account for possible misspellings, hyphenation, and spacing variations using fuzzy matching and partial matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_concept":{"type":"string","description":"Identified technical concept that corresponds to 'workload' (e.g., 'team_member.time_slice' or 'time_entry.hours')"},"project_naming_clarity":{"type":"string","description":"Description of how the 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' project is expected to appear in systems (e.g., naming patterns, abbreviations)"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"List of wiki paths or documentation sources consulted"}},"required":["workload_concept","project_naming_clarity"]}
**Result:** Based on the search of internal wiki and system data, I have clarified the following:

1. **Workload Concept**: The term "workload" in the context of project team management refers to `team_member.time_slice` (the FTE fraction allocated to team members on projects), not `time_entry.hours`. This is documented in the project registry wiki which explains that employee workload is determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices across active projects.

2. **Project Naming Clarity**: The project "pre-treatment and e-coat interface project for CentraleAuto Stamping" exists in the system with:
   - Project ID: `proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface`
   - Project Name: `Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line`
   - Customer ID: `cust_centraleauto_stamping`
   - Customer Name: `Centrale-Auto Stamping`
   
   The project is currently active and has 4 team members with different time_slice allocations.

3. **Documentation Sources**: The main documentation consulted was `systems/project_registry.md` which contains detailed information about workload calculations and team management concepts.

All facts were verified through direct system queries and wiki searches. No state-changing operations were performed during this clarification step.

{
  "workload_concept": "team_member.time_slice",
  "project_naming_clarity": "Project ID: 'proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface', Project Name: 'Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line', Customer: 'cust_centraleauto_stamping' (Centrale-Auto Stamping). The project is active and follows the naming pattern of 'proj_' + customer abbreviation + descriptive term.",
  "documentation_sources": ["systems/project_registry.md"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Map the clarified concepts to the actual technical implementation (tables and fields) that must be used to swap workloads for a project.
Approach: Based on the result of step 1 and the provided SQL schema, determine which tables and fields represent the project, the customer, and the workload that needs to be swapped. For example, if 'workload' corresponds to planned team allocation, identify the team_member table with its time_slice field; if it instead corresponds to logged hours, identify the time_entry table and relevant fields. Also confirm that the project is represented in the project table and the customer in the customer table. This step only maps concepts to technical entities; it does not yet query data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for customers (likely 'customer')"},"project_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for projects (likely 'project')"},"workload_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for workloads (e.g., 'team_member' or 'time_entry')"},"workload_field":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the field used to represent workload (e.g., 'time_slice' or 'hours')"}},"required":["customer_entity","project_entity","workload_entity","workload_field"]}
**Result:** The mapping has been verified against actual system data. The project "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface" exists and contains team members with time_slice allocations, confirming that workloads are represented as team_member.time_slice within the project's team structure. No state-changing operations were performed during this verification step.

{
  "customer_entity": "customer",
  "project_entity": "project",
  "workload_entity": "team_member",
  "workload_field": "time_slice"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific customer 'CentraleAuto Stamping' and the corresponding 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' project in the database.
Approach: Query the customer table using an exact match on name first; if not found, progressively relax using case-normalized substring search, then fuzzy matching and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field to find candidates similar to 'CentraleAuto Stamping' (accounting for possible misspellings like 'CentralAuto', 'Centrale Auto', or 'Stampings'). Once the most likely customer record is identified, query the project table filtered by this customer_id and search for projects whose name or id (normalized to lowercase and trimmed) contains the phrase 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' or close fuzzy variations. Use fuzzy matching and partial matching to handle hyphens, spelling differences, or abbreviations. If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all without deciding among them at this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_found":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","customer_id","match_score"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_found","customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I systematically searched for the customer "CentraleAuto Stamping" starting with exact match, then substring search, then fuzzy matching. The customer was found with ID "cust_centraleauto_stamping" and name "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (with a 0.98 fuzzy match ratio). I then searched for projects associated with this customer, looking for "pre-treatment and e-coat interface" using term matching and fuzzy matching. Only one project was found: ID "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface" with name "Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line". All data was verified through direct system queries with no assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.

The results show:
1. Customer found: true
2. Customer candidates: 11 customers with match scores > 0.3 (showing the progressive relaxation approach)
3. Selected customer: "cust_centraleauto_stamping" (highest match score)
4. Project candidates: 1 project with perfect match score
5. Selected project: "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface"

  "selected_project_id": "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface"
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Identify the employees 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia' and their existing workloads on the identified project.
Approach: Using the employee table, search for employees with names matching 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia'. Start with exact full-name matches; if not found, use case-normalized substring search and then fuzzy matching on the name field to handle possible variations (for example, 'Daniele L.', 'Lombardo', 'Silvia Grimaldi'). This search must be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL. After determining the most likely employee_id for each person, query the workload entity identified in step 2 (for example, team_member) for rows where project_id equals the selected_project_id from step 3 and employee_id equals each of the identified employees.

# Update the final output with the corrected information for Silvia Grimaldi
print("="*80)
print("UPDATING RESULTS WITH CORRECTED INFORMATION")
print("="*80)

# Get the project again to confirm Silvia's time_slice
project = get_project("proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface")
print(f"Project: {project.name}")
print("Current team with time_slice values:")

silvia_time_slice = None
for member in project.team:
    emp = get_employee(member.employee)
    print(f"  - {emp.name} (ID: {member.employee}): time_slice = {member.time_slice}, role = {member.role}")
    if member.employee == "QR23_039":
        silvia_time_slice = member.time_slice

print(f"\nSilvia Grimaldi's time_slice on project: {silvia_time_slice}")

# Update the employees result
employees_result = [

        "match_score": 0.533,  # From fuzzy matching
        "canonical_name": "Silvia Grimaldi"  # Correct canonical name
    }
]

# Update the workloads result
workloads_result = [
    {

<final_answer>
I have successfully completed Step 4 by identifying the employees 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia' and their existing workloads on the project. Through a systematic search approach including exact matching, substring matching, and fuzzy matching, I found:

1. **Daniele Lombardi**: Found as employee ID `QR23_013` with canonical name "Daniele Lombardi". He is currently on the project team with a time_slice (workload) of 0.3.

2. **Grimaldi Silvia**: Found as employee ID `QR23_039` with canonical name "Silvia Grimaldi". The search revealed that the name in the system is in "Firstname Lastname" order ("Silvia Grimaldi"), not "Lastname Firstname" as requested. She is currently on the project team with a time_slice of 0.4.

Both employees are confirmed to be team members on project `proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface` (Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line), and both have current workload values (time_slice allocations). No data was modified during this step - only read operations were performed.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Identify the employees 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia' and their existing workloads on the identified project.
Approach: Using the employee table, search for employees with names matching 'Daniele Lombardi' and 'Grimaldi Silvia'. Start with exact full-name matches; if not found, use case-normalized substring search and then fuzzy matching on the name field to handle possible variations (for example, 'Daniele L.', 'Lombardo', 'Silvia Grimaldi'). This search must be FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL. After determining the most likely employee_id for each person, query the workload entity identified in step 2 (for example, team_member) for rows where project_id equals the selected_project_id from step 3 and employee_id equals each of the identified employees. Retrieve their current workload values (for example, time_slice). Do not modify any data in this step; only read and assemble the current state, even if one or both employees are not yet on the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"requested_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_score":{"type":["number","null"]},"canonical_name":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["requested_name","employee_id","found"]}},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"current_workload_value":{"type":["number","null"]},"workload_row_id":{"type":["integer","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","project_id"]}},"both_workloads_present":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employees","workloads","both_workloads_present"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
