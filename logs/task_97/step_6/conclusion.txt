STEP 6 - CONCLUSION

Step 6 completed successfully. I have executed the workload swap between Daniele Lombardi (QR23_013) and Grimaldi Silvia (QR23_039) on the project "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface" (Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line). 

The operation was performed by updating the project team with swapped time_slice values:
- Daniele Lombardi's workload changed from 0.3 to 0.4
- Grimaldi Silvia's workload changed from 0.4 to 0.3

The update was performed as a single atomic operation using `update_project_team()`, which replaced the entire team list with the swapped workload values while preserving all other team members and their roles. The operation was authorized because the current user (Antonio Esposito, QR23_001) is in the Corporate Leadership department with executive privileges, allowing any project operations.

All other team members (QR23_084 and QR23_123) were unaffected by this change, maintaining their original time_slice allocations and roles.
