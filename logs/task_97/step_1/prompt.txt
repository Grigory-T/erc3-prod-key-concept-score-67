Step 1: Clarify what the user means by the 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface project for CentraleAuto Stamping' and by 'swap workloads' (for example, confirm that workload refers to team member time_slice allocation on the project, not time_entry hours) by searching internal wiki and documentation.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the wiki_file table and any internal documentation indexes for terms like 'pre-treatment', 'e-coat', 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface', and 'CentraleAuto Stamping'. Also search for internal process documentation or glossary entries describing 'workload', 'team workload', or 'time_slice' to map the business term 'workload' to the correct technical concept (for example, team_member.time_slice versus time_entry.hours). If multiple meanings are found, choose the one explicitly linked to project planning or capacity allocation. Account for possible misspellings, hyphenation, and spacing variations using fuzzy matching and partial matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_concept":{"type":"string","description":"Identified technical concept that corresponds to 'workload' (e.g., 'team_member.time_slice' or 'time_entry.hours')"},"project_naming_clarity":{"type":"string","description":"Description of how the 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' project is expected to appear in systems (e.g., naming patterns, abbreviations)"},"documentation_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"},"description":"List of wiki paths or documentation sources consulted"}},"required":["workload_concept","project_naming_clarity"]}
