Based on the search of internal wiki and system data, I have clarified the following:

1. **Workload Concept**: The term "workload" in the context of project team management refers to `team_member.time_slice` (the FTE fraction allocated to team members on projects), not `time_entry.hours`. This is documented in the project registry wiki which explains that employee workload is determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices across active projects.

2. **Project Naming Clarity**: The project "pre-treatment and e-coat interface project for CentraleAuto Stamping" exists in the system with:
   - Project ID: `proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface`
   - Project Name: `Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line`
   - Customer ID: `cust_centraleauto_stamping`
   - Customer Name: `Centrale-Auto Stamping`
   
   The project is currently active and has 4 team members with different time_slice allocations.

3. **Documentation Sources**: The main documentation consulted was `systems/project_registry.md` which contains detailed information about workload calculations and team management concepts.

All facts were verified through direct system queries and wiki searches. No state-changing operations were performed during this clarification step.
