Step 3: Locate the specific customer 'CentraleAuto Stamping' and the corresponding 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' project in the database.
Approach: Query the customer table using an exact match on name first; if not found, progressively relax using case-normalized substring search, then fuzzy matching and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on the name field to find candidates similar to 'CentraleAuto Stamping' (accounting for possible misspellings like 'CentralAuto', 'Centrale Auto', or 'Stampings'). Once the most likely customer record is identified, query the project table filtered by this customer_id and search for projects whose name or id (normalized to lowercase and trimmed) contains the phrase 'pre-treatment and e-coat interface' or close fuzzy variations. Use fuzzy matching and partial matching to handle hyphens, spelling differences, or abbreviations. If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all without deciding among them at this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_found":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","customer_id","match_score"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_found","customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
