Completed: 2025-12-10 00:34:20

I have successfully executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I systematically searched for the customer "CentraleAuto Stamping" starting with exact match, then substring search, then fuzzy matching. The customer was found with ID "cust_centraleauto_stamping" and name "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (with a 0.98 fuzzy match ratio). I then searched for projects associated with this customer, looking for "pre-treatment and e-coat interface" using term matching and fuzzy matching. Only one project was found: ID "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface" with name "Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line". All data was verified through direct system queries with no assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.

The results show:
1. Customer found: true
2. Customer candidates: 11 customers with match scores > 0.3 (showing the progressive relaxation approach)
3. Selected customer: "cust_centraleauto_stamping" (highest match score)
4. Project candidates: 1 project with perfect match score
5. Selected project: "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface"
