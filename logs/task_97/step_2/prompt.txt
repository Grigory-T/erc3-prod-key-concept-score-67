Step 2: Map the clarified concepts to the actual technical implementation (tables and fields) that must be used to swap workloads for a project.
Approach: Based on the result of step 1 and the provided SQL schema, determine which tables and fields represent the project, the customer, and the workload that needs to be swapped. For example, if 'workload' corresponds to planned team allocation, identify the team_member table with its time_slice field; if it instead corresponds to logged hours, identify the time_entry table and relevant fields. Also confirm that the project is represented in the project table and the customer in the customer table. This step only maps concepts to technical entities; it does not yet query data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for customers (likely 'customer')"},"project_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for projects (likely 'project')"},"workload_entity":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the table used for workloads (e.g., 'team_member' or 'time_entry')"},"workload_field":{"type":"string","description":"Name of the field used to represent workload (e.g., 'time_slice' or 'hours')"}},"required":["customer_entity","project_entity","workload_entity","workload_field"]}
