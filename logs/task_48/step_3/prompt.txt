Step 3: If one unique 'Gabriele' is identified, retrieve current skill and will records for 'Production planning and scheduling' (skill) and 'Willingness to travel' (will) for that employee.
Approach: For the single employee_id found in step 2, query their skills/wills using available helper functions. Search for existing entries with skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name similar to 'Production planning and scheduling', and skill_type = 'will' and skill_name similar to 'Willingness to travel'. Use exact and partial/fuzzy matching to locate the most relevant records if skill names vary in format.
