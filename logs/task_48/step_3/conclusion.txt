I have successfully executed step 3 by retrieving Gabriele Ventura's current skill and will records. Using the employee ID "bAsk_120" identified in step 2, I fetched the full employee profile and searched for the specific skill "Production planning and scheduling" and will "Willingness to travel".

**Results:**

1. **Skill: "Production planning and scheduling"**
   - Exact match not found in employee's skills list
   - Closest matching skill via fuzzy search: "skill_production_planning" (similarity ratio: 0.61)
   - Current level of "skill_production_planning": 2

2. **Will: "Willingness to travel"**
   - Exact match not found in employee's wills list
   - Closest matching will via fuzzy search: "will_travel" (similarity ratio: 0.62)
   - Current level of "will_travel": 6

The search revealed that while the exact names specified in the task don't exist in Gabriele's profile, there are closely related entries that likely correspond to the intended skill and will items. These current levels (2 for production planning skill and 6 for travel will) will serve as the baseline for the upcoming update step.

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were executed as instructed.
