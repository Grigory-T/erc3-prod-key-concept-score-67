Step 5: Attempt to update or insert 'Willingness to travel' will to the required level 8 for Gabriele.
Approach: If system permissions allow, use the helper function to either update (if found in step 3) or insert (if missing) the 'Willingness to travel' will for Gabriele's employee_id, setting skill_type = 'will' and level = 8. As in step 4, if denied at the API level, record the security or permission denial without further escalation.
