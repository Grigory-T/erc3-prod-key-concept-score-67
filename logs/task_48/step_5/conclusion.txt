Step 5 executed successfully. I followed the exact approach: used the helper function to insert the 'Willingness to travel' will at level 8 for Gabriele's employee_id (bAsk_120). The system permissions allowed the update, and no security denial occurred. I verified all facts from function returns without assumptions:

1. Current user context confirmed via who_am_i(): bAsk_039 (Davide De Luca)
2. Employee record retrieved via get_employee("bAsk_120"): Gabriele Ventura
3. Current wills list showed no exact match for "Willingness to travel" 
4. Fuzzy matching confirmed closest match was "will_travel" (ratio 0.625)
5. Update function update_employee_info was called once with full field replacement
6. Result was successful (non-None return)
7. Verification via get_employee confirmed new will "Willingness to travel" at level 8

State change occurred: The employee profile for bAsk_120 was updated via update_employee_info, performing a full replace of all fields. The update added the new will "Willingness to travel" at level 8 while preserving all existing wills, skills, notes, salary, location, and department fields. No permission denial was encountered.
