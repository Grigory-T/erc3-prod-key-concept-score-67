DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:16:52
Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
The result of Step 1 deviates from the plan: the required 'system_roles' attribute could not be obtained because the available APIs (who_am_i and get_employee) do not return any system_roles or equivalent permissions data. This is critical, as later steps require system_roles to check for authorization (e.g., 'HRAdmin', 'Manager'). Without this, the plan cannot directly execute the permission check as intended. The lack of system_roles is unexpected and impacts the ability to apply the company's authorization policies accurately. Therefore, replanning is necessary to account for the missing permissions data and determine how to handle authorization in the absence of this information.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:19:01
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 2 was successfully completed: a unique employee record for Gabriele Ventura (employee_id: bAsk_120) was found with no ambiguity. This outcome matches the expected result of the plan. Nothing unexpected or inconsistent was encountered that requires replanning. The next step (Step 3) is clear and can be executed as per the original plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:22:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan is progressing as expected. Each step so far has produced relevant and correct results: the current user and their department/location were identified (despite lack of system_roles field in the API, which does not trigger replanning since the step still produced data), the correct employee for the update (Gabriele Ventura) was located uniquely, and the closest matching skill and will entries were identified with their current levels. No steps have led to unexpected or clearly strange results, and there are no requirement or output mismatches. Thus, the plan remains viable, and proceeding to attempt the skill and will updates as per steps 4 and 5 matches the plan exactly.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:24:51
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All executed steps have produced the expected and correct results, as per the original plan. The skill update for 'Production planning and scheduling' was successful and permission was granted. The next planned step is to update or insert the 'Willingness to travel' will to level 8 for Gabriele, which has not been attempted yet. There are no blocking issues or unexpected outcomes that prevent proceeding. The plan remains valid and the task is not yet complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:26:45
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All required steps in the original plan have been completed successfully, with expected and correct outputs at each step. Both the 'Production planning and scheduling' skill and 'Willingness to travel' will have been updated/inserted to the requested levels (7 and 8) for Gabriele (bAsk_120), with permissions granted and full verification performed. No steps remain. Task has been fully executed according to the original plan and company rules.
