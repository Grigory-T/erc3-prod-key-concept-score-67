Step 4 has been executed as instructed. I attempted to update or insert the skill "Production planning and scheduling" to level 7 for Gabriele Ventura (employee ID: bAsk_120).

Verification of execution:
1. Retrieved current user context: Davide De Luca (bAsk_039) from R&D and Technical Service, HQ – Italy.
2. Retrieved Gabriele's full employee record: confirmed ID bAsk_120, name Gabriele Ventura.
3. Checked existing skills: 15 skills listed, exact string "Production planning and scheduling" was not present.
4. Prepared updated skills list: added new skill "Production planning and scheduling" with level 7 while preserving all existing skills.
5. Called update_employee_info with all required fields (notes, salary, skills, wills, location, department) to perform full replace.
6. The function returned a non-None result, indicating permission was granted and update succeeded.
7. Verified the update by fetching the employee again: skill "Production planning and scheduling" is now present at level 7.

State change occurred: The employee profile for bAsk_120 was updated. The update_employee_info function performed a full replace of all fields. The following fields were set:
- Skills: All previous 15 skills plus new skill "Production planning and scheduling" at level 7
- Wills: Preserved unchanged (from original employee.wills)
- Notes: Preserved as empty string (from employee.notes)
- Salary: Preserved as 67000 (from employee.salary)
- Location: Preserved as "HQ – Italy" (from employee.location)
- Department: Preserved as "Quality & HSE" (from employee.department)

No permission denial occurred; the API allowed the update. The step is complete.
