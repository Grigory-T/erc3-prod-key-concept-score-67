Step 4: Attempt to update or insert 'Production planning and scheduling' skill to the required level 7 for Gabriele.
Approach: If system permissions allow, use the helper function to either update (if found in step 3) or insert (if missing) the 'Production planning and scheduling' skill for Gabriele's employee_id, setting skill_type = 'skill' and level = 7. If the API denies permission (likely due to lacking 'system_roles'), record the denial as outcome and stop further attempts for this field (without error escalation).
