Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-21
Current actor: Authenticated user bAsk_039
User details: {"id": "bAsk_039", "name": "Davide De Luca", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```python
update_employee_info(employee_id, notes=None, salary=None, skills=None, wills=None, location=None, department=None, changed_by=None) -> object | None
# ⚠️ FULL REPLACE! Omitted fields get RESET.
# ⚠️ skills/wills MUST be list of dicts, NOT SkillLevel objects!
# Example:
#   old = get_employee(id)
#   skills_dicts = [{'name': s.name, 'level': s.level} for s in old.skills]
#   wills_dicts = [{'name': w.name, 'level': w.level} for w in old.wills]
#   update_employee_info(id, salary=new, notes=old.notes, skills=skills_dicts, 
#      wills=wills_dicts, location=old.location, department=old.department)


update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: bAsk_039
department: R&D and Technical Service
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-08-21
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** After our performance review on HV anti-corrosion system for rail bogies, update Gabriele's profile so that their Production planning and scheduling skill is set to level 7 and their Willingness to travel is set to level 8.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Davide De Luca, user id 'bAsk_039') and retrieve their system roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry (who_am_i) in order to support later permission checks for updating another employee's skills and wills.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or EmployeeRegistry service (for example, a who_am_i endpoint or equivalent query) to fetch the full technical identity for the current user 'bAsk_039'. Do not log any data, only read. Ensure the result includes at least: internal employee id, full name, department, location, and system_roles (such as 'HRAdmin', 'Manager', 'R&DUser', etc.). No additional validation beyond reading the existing data. The search for the user should be exact by authenticated id and should not require fuzzy logic.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["user_id", "system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction by calling the appropriate identity service (`who_am_i()`) and the EmployeeRegistry service (`get_employee()`). Both functions were called with the exact authenticated user ID 'bAsk_039' without using fuzzy logic. The data retrieved includes:

1. From `who_am_i()`: user_id ('bAsk_039'), location ('HQ – Italy'), department ('R&D and Technical Service'), and other context.
2. From `get_employee()`: name ('Davide De Luca'), email, salary, skills, wills, and other employee details.

However, neither function returns a `system_roles` attribute. The `WhoAmI` and `EmployeeFull` data structures, as defined in the available functions, do not include a `system_roles` field. I have verified this by checking the attributes of the returned objects and found no `system_roles` attribute.

Since the step requires retrieving system roles and the API does not provide this information, I cannot fulfill that part of the requirement. I have only used data explicitly returned by the functions and made no assumptions or inferences. The `system_roles` array in the JSON output is empty because no system roles data is available via the current API.

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were executed as instructed.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_039",
  "name": "Davide De Luca",
  "department": "R&D and Technical Service",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Locate the employee record for 'Gabriele' to determine the unique employee_id for skill and will updates.
Approach: Query the EmployeeRegistry for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. Begin with an exact match on the name, and if none or multiple results are found, use fuzzy/partial match logic as available through helper functions. Collect identifiers, names, and emails of all candidates; do NOT automatically resolve ambiguity at this step.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ASSISTANT] (message 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute Step 2 to locate the employee record for 'Gabriele' and collect candidate information.

```python
# Step 2: Locate employee record for 'Gabriele'
print("=== Step 2: Searching for employee 'Gabriele' ===")

# First, let's get all employees to work with
all_employees = list_all_employees()
print(f"Total employees in system: {len(all_employees)}")

# Try exact substring match (case-insensitive)
exact_matches = []
for emp in all_employees:
    if 'gabriele' in emp.name.lower():
        exact_matches.append(emp)

print(f"\nExact substring matches for 'Gabriele': {len(exact_matches)}")
for emp in exact_matches:
    print(f"  - {emp.id}: {emp.name} ({emp.email})")

# If no exact matches, try fuzzy matching
if not exact_matches:
    print("\nNo exact matches found, trying fuzzy matching...")
    
    # Extract employee names for fuzzy comparison
    employee_names = [emp.name for emp in all_employees]
    
    # Use fuzzy_compare to find matches for 'Gabriele'
    fuzzy_results = fuzzy_compare(["Gabriele"], employee_names, top_n=10)
    
    print(f"Top {len(fuzzy_results)} fuzzy matches:")
    for result in fuzzy_results:
        target = result['target']
        candidate = result['candidate']
        ratio = result['ratio']
        
        # Find the employee with this name
        matching_employees = [emp for emp in all_employees if emp.name == candidate]
        
        if matching_employees:
            emp = matching_employees[0]
            print(f"  - Ratio: {ratio:.2f}: {emp.id}: {emp.name} ({emp.email})")
            
            # Add to matches if ratio is reasonable (e.g., > 0.7)
            if ratio > 0.7:
                exact_matches.append(emp)

# Collect all candidates (exact matches or fuzzy matches with good ratio)
candidates = []
for emp in exact_matches:
    candidates.append({
        "id": emp.id,
        "name": emp.name,
        "email": emp.email
    })

print(f"\nTotal candidates found: {len(candidates)}")
for cand in candidates:
    print(f"  - {cand['id']}: {cand['name']} ({cand['email']})")
```

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 2 to locate the employee record for 'Gabriele'. Using the EmployeeRegistry, I searched for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. 

The search found exactly one employee matching the name 'Gabriele':
- Employee ID: bAsk_120
- Name: Gabriele Ventura
- Email: bAsk_120@bellini.internal

Since there is only one candidate, there is no ambiguity to resolve at this step. The unique employee_id for Gabriele has been identified as 'bAsk_120'.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Locate the employee record for 'Gabriele' to determine the unique employee_id for skill and will updates.
Approach: Query the EmployeeRegistry for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. Begin with an exact match on the name, and if none or multiple results are found, use fuzzy/partial match logic as available through helper functions. Collect identifiers, names, and emails of all candidates; do NOT automatically resolve ambiguity at this step.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ASSISTANT] (message 6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have verified the execution of Step 2 against the checklist:

**Did you execute the step instruction?**
- Yes, I executed the step instruction to query the EmployeeRegistry for employees named 'Gabriele'
- I began with an exact match on the name by searching for 'gabriele' in employee names (case-insensitive substring match)
- I found exactly one employee with name containing 'Gabriele'

**Is there any action you skipped or assumed?**
- No, I followed the approach exactly as specified
- Since exactly one result was found, fuzzy/partial match logic was not needed (the instruction says "if none or multiple results are found, use fuzzy/partial match logic")
- I collected the identifier, name, and email of the candidate as required

**Are all facts verified (not assumed)?**
- Yes, all facts come directly from function returns:
  - `list_all_employees()` returned 154 total employees
  - The exact substring match found employee bAsk_120: Gabriele Ventura
  - The ID, name, and email were printed directly from the EmployeeBrief object

**JSON response contains ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns:**
- The employee_id "bAsk_120" was printed from `emp.id`
- The name "Gabriele Ventura" was printed from `emp.name`  
- The email "bAsk_120@bellini.internal" was printed from `emp.email`

**No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations were performed.

The step is complete. I have located the employee record for 'Gabriele' and determined the unique employee_id is bAsk_120.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 2 to locate the employee record for 'Gabriele'. Using the EmployeeRegistry, I searched for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. 

The search found exactly one employee matching the name 'Gabriele':
- Employee ID: bAsk_120
- Name: Gabriele Ventura
- Email: bAsk_120@bellini.internal

Since there is only one candidate, there is no ambiguity to resolve at this step. The unique employee_id for Gabriele has been identified as 'bAsk_120'.
