I have successfully executed Step 2 to locate the employee record for 'Gabriele'. Using the EmployeeRegistry, I searched for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. 

The search found exactly one employee matching the name 'Gabriele':
- Employee ID: bAsk_120
- Name: Gabriele Ventura
- Email: bAsk_120@bellini.internal

Since there is only one candidate, there is no ambiguity to resolve at this step. The unique employee_id for Gabriele has been identified as 'bAsk_120'.

{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "bAsk_120",
      "name": "Gabriele Ventura",
      "email": "bAsk_120@bellini.internal"
    }
  ]
}
