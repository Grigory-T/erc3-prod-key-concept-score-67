Step 2: Locate the employee record for 'Gabriele' to determine the unique employee_id for skill and will updates.
Approach: Query the EmployeeRegistry for all employees whose name matches or resembles 'Gabriele'. Begin with an exact match on the name, and if none or multiple results are found, use fuzzy/partial match logic as available through helper functions. Collect identifiers, names, and emails of all candidates; do NOT automatically resolve ambiguity at this step.
