Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Davide De Luca, user id 'bAsk_039') and retrieve their system roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry (who_am_i) in order to support later permission checks for updating another employee's skills and wills.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or EmployeeRegistry service (for example, a who_am_i endpoint or equivalent query) to fetch the full technical identity for the current user 'bAsk_039'. Do not log any data, only read. Ensure the result includes at least: internal employee id, full name, department, location, and system_roles (such as 'HRAdmin', 'Manager', 'R&DUser', etc.). No additional validation beyond reading the existing data. The search for the user should be exact by authenticated id and should not require fuzzy logic.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["user_id", "system_roles"]}
