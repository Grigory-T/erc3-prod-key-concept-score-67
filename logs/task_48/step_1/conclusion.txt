STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

I have executed the step instruction by calling the appropriate identity service (`who_am_i()`) and the EmployeeRegistry service (`get_employee()`). Both functions were called with the exact authenticated user ID 'bAsk_039' without using fuzzy logic. The data retrieved includes:

1. From `who_am_i()`: user_id ('bAsk_039'), location ('HQ – Italy'), department ('R&D and Technical Service'), and other context.
2. From `get_employee()`: name ('Davide De Luca'), email, salary, skills, wills, and other employee details.

However, neither function returns a `system_roles` attribute. The `WhoAmI` and `EmployeeFull` data structures, as defined in the available functions, do not include a `system_roles` field. I have verified this by checking the attributes of the returned objects and found no `system_roles` attribute.

Since the step requires retrieving system roles and the API does not provide this information, I cannot fulfill that part of the requirement. I have only used data explicitly returned by the functions and made no assumptions or inferences. The `system_roles` array in the JSON output is empty because no system roles data is available via the current API.

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were executed as instructed.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_039",
  "name": "Davide De Luca",
  "department": "R&D and Technical Service",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
