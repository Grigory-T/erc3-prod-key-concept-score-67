STEP 2 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 21:16:14

I have verified that Step 2 was executed correctly. All facts were verified from function returns:

1. Searched technical documentation using `search_wiki_fuzzy()` for terms related to data sources and APIs
2. Examined CRM documentation using `load_wiki("systems/crm.md")` to confirm data fields
3. Tested `search_customers()` function to verify it can filter by deal_phase
4. Verified available functions include customer, project, employee, and time entry APIs
5. Found no dedicated "get_key_accounts" or "get_exploration_deals" APIs - standard customer API functions are used
6. Confirmed from documentation that customer.high_level_status contains "Key account" and customer.deal_phase contains "exploring"

All conclusions are based on actual function returns and documentation analysis, with no assumptions or made-up data.

{
  "primary_customer_source": "CRM system customer table",
  "primary_deal_source": "CRM system customer.deal_phase field",
  "uses_customer_table": true,
  "uses_project_table": false,
  "has_higher_level_api": true,
  "higher_level_api_name": "Customer API (search_customers, get_customer, list_customers)"
}
