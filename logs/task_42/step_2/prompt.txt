Step 2: Identify the concrete technical data sources and access methods that implement the concepts of key accounts and exploration deals, based on the business definitions from Step 1.
Approach: Using the output of Step 1, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over technical documentation, data models, and service descriptions to find which tables and/or APIs store key account and deal information. Start from the known SQL schema (customer, project, employee, and related tables) and confirm, for example, whether key accounts are flagged within customer.high_level_status or other fields, and whether exploration deals are represented via customer.deal_phase = 'exploring' or project.status = 'exploring'. If internal services or CRM APIs exist, locate their names and usage patterns using fuzzy matching for keywords like "customer", "deal", "pipeline", "key account", and "explore" (including misspellings and abbreviations). Determine the primary data source to query (for example, direct SQL on the customer and project tables) and whether there are any dedicated helper functions or views to use.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"primary_customer_source":{"type":"string"},"primary_deal_source":{"type":"string"},"uses_customer_table":{"type":"boolean"},"uses_project_table":{"type":"boolean"},"has_higher_level_api":{"type":"boolean"},"higher_level_api_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["primary_customer_source","primary_deal_source","uses_customer_table","uses_project_table","has_higher_level_api","higher_level_api_name"]}
