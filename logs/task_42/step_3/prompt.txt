Step 3: Verify that the current user (employee id 'iv5n_139', Claudio Fabbri) has permission to read the necessary customer and project data required to answer which key account has the biggest number of exploration deals.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity and authorization mechanisms (for example, who_am_i and permission-check functions) to retrieve the full role set and access rights of user 'iv5n_139'. Then check, in a purely read-only context, whether this user is allowed to query customer records (including fields such as name, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager) and project records (including fields such as customer_id and status) in the CRM or database identified in Step 2. Use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching if permission scopes are described with business labels (for example, "CRM viewer", "sales analyst") rather than exact table names. Do not attempt any write operations. Record, separately, whether reading customers and reading projects is allowed; if any required read is not permitted, indicate that this will block the task.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"blocking_permission_issue":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_read_customers","can_read_projects","blocking_permission_issue","denial_reason"]}
