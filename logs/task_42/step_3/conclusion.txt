I have thoroughly executed Step 3 to verify the current user's permissions to read customer and project data. Here is a comprehensive summary of the verification:

1. **User Identity and Role**: Claudio Fabbri (employee ID: iv5n_139) works in the Finance & Administration department at HQ – Italy. His employee profile shows skills in CRM systems (level 5) and CRM (level 5), but no explicit system roles are listed in the profile.

2. **Permission Testing via API Calls**: 
   - Successfully read customer data using `list_customers()`, `list_all_customers()`, and `get_customer()`
   - Successfully read project data using `list_projects()`, `list_all_projects()`, and `get_project()`
   - Verified access to specific fields needed for the task: `customer.high_level_status`, `customer.deal_phase`, `project.customer`, and `project.status`
   - Tested with 21 total customers and 36 total projects - all accessible

3. **Wiki Documentation Analysis**:
   - Searched for permission/role definitions using fuzzy matching for terms like "CRM viewer", "sales analyst", "system role"
   - Found that system roles (e.g., "SalesUser", "R&DUser", "HRAdmin", "ITAdmin") control access but reading CRM data appears generally allowed
   - No documentation was found that restricts the Finance & Administration department from reading customer or project data

4. **Company Rules Compliance**:
   - According to provided company rules: "Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records"
   - The rules focus on restricting mutations (write operations), not reads
   - No explicit restrictions prevent reading customer or project data for authenticated users

5. **Field-Specific Access Verification**:
   - Can read `customer.high_level_status` field (contains values like "Key account")
   - Can read `customer.deal_phase` field (contains value "exploring" for exploration deals)
   - Can read `customer.account_manager` field
   - Can read `project.customer` and `project.status` fields

6. **Task-Specific Verification**:
   - Successfully identified key accounts (customers with "Key account" in high_level_status)
   - Successfully identified exploration deals (customers with deal_phase = "exploring")
   - Can link projects to customers via the project.customer field

The verification confirms that Claudio Fabbri has the necessary read permissions to access all customer and project data required to determine which key account has the biggest number of exploration deals. No blocking permission issues exist.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification step.

{
  "user_id": "iv5n_139",
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "can_read_projects": true,
  "blocking_permission_issue": false,
  "denial_reason": "No blocking issues - user has necessary read permissions for customer and project data"
}
