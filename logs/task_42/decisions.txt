DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:07:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been executed successfully, producing precise, well-documented definitions and mappings for both 'key account' (customer.high_level_status = 'Key account') and 'exploration deal' (customer.deal_phase = 'exploring'). These results perfectly match the expected output schema for Step 1, and there is no missing or unexpected information. The next step (Step 2) is to identify the concrete technical data sources and access methods based on these exact field mappings. There are no inconsistencies, errors, or new information requiring a replan. The plan remains fully valid as written.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:16:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is proceeding as expected. Both Step 1 and Step 2 have been completed fully and exactly as instructed, with all required business definitions and data mappings verified, and with technical data sources confirmed. There have been no discrepancies, missing functions, or permission issues so far. The next step (Step 3) is to check current user authorization for read access, which is essential and required by the original plan before proceeding to data retrieval and aggregation. Therefore, the task should continue as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:21:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have completed successfully, matching the required outputs precisely as defined in the Original Plan. There are no permission issues, no data issues, and no inconsistencies. The Original Plan remains valid, and the next logical action is to proceed with Step 4, which is to retrieve and aggregate the relevant data per the plan. No evidence suggests replanning is needed. Continuing aligns with company policy and the step-by-step intent of the task.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:33:11
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 4 produced the expected aggregation: identified all key accounts and counted their associated exploration deals, showing one key account (Centrale-Auto Stamping) with 1 exploration deal and the others with zero. There are no inconsistencies, missing functions, or unexpected results. This matches the plan, and the next (final) step is a simple in-memory calculation to generate the answer. Therefore, the plan remains valid and should continue to Step 5 as per the original instructions.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:34:54
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been thoroughly and correctly executed. Each step delivered the expected outputs based solely on direct data retrieval and analysis, without any skipped, blocked, or ambiguous results. The final step produced a complete and decisive answer: Centrale-Auto Stamping is the key account with the highest number of exploration deals (1), and all findings fully align with the business definitions, data mappings, permissions, and context established earlier. Therefore, the task is now fully complete and the final answer can be given.
