Step 1: Clarify the business meaning of the terms "key account" and "exploration deal" within Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A., and determine how these concepts map to existing data fields (for example, customer.high_level_status, customer.deal_phase, project.status). This includes checking whether "key account" refers to specific customers, specific account managers (employees), or a tagged subset of customers, and whether an "exploration deal" is represented by customer deal_phase = 'exploring' or by projects with status = 'exploring'.
Approach: Search the internal knowledge base and documentation (for example, wiki_file records) using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms such as "key account", "key accounts", "strategic account", "strategic customer", "tier 1 customer", "exploration deal", "exploring deal", "deal phase", and "pipeline". Account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, and variations (for example, "KA", "key acct", "exploring"), and also search by related business-process phrases (for example, "account segmentation", "customer tiers"). From the best matching documents, extract the explicit definitions and any described mappings to concrete CRM or database fields, and summarize them into a clear working rule set that will be used in later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found_key_account_definition":{"type":"boolean"},"key_account_definition":{"type":"string"},"key_account_data_mapping":{"type":"string"},"found_exploration_deal_definition":{"type":"boolean"},"exploration_deal_definition":{"type":"string"},"exploration_deal_data_mapping":{"type":"string"}},"required":["found_key_account_definition","key_account_definition","key_account_data_mapping","found_exploration_deal_definition","exploration_deal_definition","exploration_deal_data_mapping"]}
