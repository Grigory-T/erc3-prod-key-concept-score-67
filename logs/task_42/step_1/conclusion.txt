Yes, I executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. I performed the following actions:

1. **Search the internal wiki using fuzzy search** for terms including "key account", "key accounts", "strategic account", "KA", "exploration deal", "exploring deal", "deal phase", "pipeline", and related business-process phrases.

2. **Analyzed the search results** from 19 wiki files, with 135 fuzzy matches for key account terms and 105 fuzzy matches for exploration terms.

3. **Examined the most relevant wiki files** in detail:
   - `business/markets_and_customers.md`
   - `systems/crm.md`
   - `business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md`
   - `systems/project_registry.md`

4. **Extracted explicit definitions and field mappings** directly from the wiki content:
   - From `business/markets_and_customers.md`: "Customer remains in CRM with a high‑level status (e.g. 'Curious but cautious', 'Key account', 'Dormant')" and "Deal phase: `exploring`"
   - From `systems/crm.md`: "High‑level status (e.g. 'Key account', 'Curious but cautious', 'Dormant')" and "`exploring` – deeper exploration, early trials"

5. **Verified the data field mappings** by examining the CRM data model documentation, confirming that:
   - "Key account" maps to the `customer.high_level_status` field
   - "Exploration deal" maps to the `customer.deal_phase` field with value 'exploring'

All facts were verified directly from function returns. No assumptions were made, no update functions were called (no state changes), and no data was invented. The conclusions are based solely on the wiki documentation content retrieved through the search functions.
