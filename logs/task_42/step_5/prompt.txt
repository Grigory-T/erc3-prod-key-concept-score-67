Step 5: Determine which key account or key accounts have the highest number of exploration deals based on the aggregated data and prepare the final answer, listing all key accounts in case of a tie.
Approach: From the list produced in Step 4, compute the maximum value of exploration_deal_count. If the list is empty, conclude that no key accounts with exploration deals could be found under the current definitions and permissions. Otherwise, select all key account entries whose exploration_deal_count equals this maximum value. Ensure that this is purely an in-memory calculation over the existing dataset with no additional external queries. The result should explicitly list each top key account by identifier and name, together with its exploration_deal_count and the global maximum used for comparison.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"max_exploration_deal_count":{"type":"integer"},"key_accounts_with_max":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"key_account_id":{"type":"string"},"key_account_name":{"type":"string"},"exploration_deal_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["key_account_id","key_account_name","exploration_deal_count"]}},"no_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["max_exploration_deal_count","key_accounts_with_max","no_data"]}
