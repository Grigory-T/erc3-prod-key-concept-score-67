STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 21:34:48

I have verified that Step 5 was executed correctly according to the step description. All required actions were performed:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: I used the aggregated data from Step 4 and performed an in-memory calculation to:
   - Compute the maximum value of exploration_deal_count (which is 1)
   - Select all key account entries with that maximum count (only Centrale-Auto Stamping)
   - Handle the case where the list is not empty (no_data = False)

2. **No actions were skipped or assumed**: The calculation was performed purely on the existing dataset from Step 4 with no additional external queries. The Python code execution clearly shows the calculation process and results.

3. **All facts were verified from function returns**: The data used comes directly from Step 4's verified output, which was itself derived from actual API calls (list_all_customers, list_all_projects). No make-up data or sensible defaults were used.

4. **No state-changing functions were called**: Only read operations and in-memory calculations were performed in this step.

The verification shows the step was completed correctly according to the requirements.
