Step 3: Check whether the current user has permission to update the employee notes field for the identified employee (assumed to be 'UpdateEmployeeNotes' or equivalent action).
Approach: If the previous step successfully identified a single target employee for 'Gabriele Ventura', call the backend permission_check or backend_permission_check function with parameters (current_user_id from step 1, target_employee_id from step 2, action='UpdateEmployeeNotes'). Use only the actual system_roles returned in step 1 to drive the backend decision; do not derive new roles. Wait for the backend decision. If the backend denies the action, this plan will later abort the update and report a security denial; if allowed, proceed to the update step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"action":{"type":"string"},"user_id":{"type":"string"},"target_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["allowed","action","user_id","target_employee_id"]}
