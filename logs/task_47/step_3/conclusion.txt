STEP 3 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 21:12:34

I have executed Step 3 as instructed by attempting to perform the backend permission check. After thorough verification:

1. I confirmed from Step 1 that the current user is Bhwa_133 (Ilaria Puglisi) with an empty system_roles array
2. I confirmed from Step 2 that the target employee is Bhwa_040 (Gabriele Ventura)
3. I examined all available functions listed in the API documentation and found no `backend_permission_check` or `permission_check` function
4. The step explicitly requires calling this specific function with parameters (current_user_id, target_employee_id, action='UpdateEmployeeNotes')
5. Since the required function is not available in the API, I cannot complete the permission verification as specified

All facts are verified: the user IDs are confirmed from previous steps, and the absence of the required function is confirmed by examining the complete list of available functions. No assumptions were made about roles or permissions. Since the step cannot be executed as written due to missing functionality, I return a denial with the appropriate reason.

{
  "allowed": false,
  "action": "UpdateEmployeeNotes",
  "user_id": "Bhwa_133",
  "target_employee_id": "Bhwa_040",
  "denial_reason": "Cannot perform backend permission check; required function not available in the API."
}
