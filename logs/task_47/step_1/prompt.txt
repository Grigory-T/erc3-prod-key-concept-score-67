Step 1: Resolve the current authenticated user identity (Ilaria Puglisi, user id 'Bhwa_133') and load their department, location, and system roles using a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint.
Approach: Call the identity or who_am_i service to retrieve the bound employee record for the current session, ensuring we get at least: user_id, name, department, location, and system_roles (for example, 'HRAdmin', 'Manager', etc.). Do not infer or invent roles; rely only on what the backend returns. This step is purely to understand who is acting and will later be used in the permission check.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
