Step 1 has been executed as instructed. I called the `who_am_i()` function to retrieve the current authenticated user identity and then used `get_employee()` to get the full employee record. The results show:

1. Current user ID: Bhwa_133 (from who_am_i().current_user)
2. Name: Ilaria Puglisi (from get_employee().name)
3. Department: Human Resources (HR) (from who_am_i().department, verified with get_employee().department)
4. Location: HQ – Italy (from who_am_i().location, verified with get_employee().location)

However, despite thorough checking of both the who_am_i() response and the employee record, the `system_roles` field is not available through any of the provided API functions. I verified this by:
- Checking all attributes of the WhoAmI object (no system_roles attribute)
- Checking all attributes of the EmployeeFull object (no system_roles attribute)
- Examining the structure of other employee records (also no system_roles)

According to the company rules, system roles are bound from the EmployeeRegistry for authorization decisions, but this information is not exposed through the current API endpoints available to me. Since I cannot retrieve system roles without inventing data, I must return an empty array for this field as required by the step's expected output structure.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_133",
  "name": "Ilaria Puglisi",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
