Step 2 completed successfully. I followed the stepwise search strategy exactly as specified:

1. First attempted an exact match on employee.name = 'Gabriele Ventura' - Found 1 exact match
2. Since an exact match was found, I didn't need to proceed to case-insensitive or fuzzy matching approaches
3. Retrieved only non-sensitive fields (id, name, email, location, department, notes) and explicitly avoided salary data
4. The search returned exactly one candidate with a perfect match score of 100

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Total employees in system: 154 (from list_all_employees())
- Exact matches found: 1 (Gabriele Ventura with ID Bhwa_040)
- Employee details verified via get_employee() call
- No state-changing operations were performed in this step

The employee was found with exact name match: Gabriele Ventura (ID: Bhwa_040), email: Bhwa_040@bellini.internal, location: HQ – Italy, department: R&D and Technical Service, notes: null.
