Step 2: Find the employee record for 'Gabriele Ventura' in the employee table, allowing for possible typos, misspellings, or variations in the name.
Approach: Query the employee table using a stepwise search strategy: (1) attempt an exact match on employee.name = 'Gabriele Ventura'; (2) if not found, perform a case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized search where 'gabriele' and 'ventura' are contained in the name field; (3) if still ambiguous or not found, use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) and FUZZY as well as SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the name field to account for minor spelling differences or ordering, and if needed search by email or other identifying attributes if available. If multiple candidates are found, select the best match based on highest fuzzy score and logical consistency (full name match preferred). Only retrieve non-sensitive fields (id, name, email, location, department, notes) and explicitly avoid selecting salary. If no plausible match is found, note that the target employee could not be identified.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"selected_employee":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","email","location","department"]},"all_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["found","candidate_count"]}
