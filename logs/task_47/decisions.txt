DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:07:50
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was executed exactly as per the plan. The only deviation is that the 'system_roles' field cannot be retrieved, but the plan states we must not invent data and must proceed with an empty array. The next step (Step 2) does not require system_roles, but only an employee lookup by name. This is expected and the remaining steps can still proceed with actual data when available. No replanning is required since the step result is as expected given the constraints.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:10:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 completed as planned and provided correct, relevant results. The inability to retrieve system_roles means we must supply an empty array, but this is consistent with the expected output for Step 1 given available API responses. Step 2 found exactly one, correct employee for updating. These are not strange or invalid results—they fit the plan. There is no need to replan: we can continue to Step 3 as outlined in the original plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:12:39
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
Step 3 could not be completed because the required backend permission check function does not exist or is not available through the current API. According to the Original Plan, Step 4 (the update) can only proceed if Step 3 returns allowed=true. Since Step 3 is impossible to execute as written and no permission can be verified, the plan cannot be completed as specified. The Original Plan strictly requires backend permission validation based on actual system roles, with no role inference permitted. Proceeding further would violate company policy and the explicit workflow. Therefore, the only correct action is to abort the task, giving a precise reason.
