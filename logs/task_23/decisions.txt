Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed exactly as per the original plan, verifying that the user is a guest and not permitted access to internal systems. There were no errors or unexpected issues encountered. The next logical step is to proceed to Step 2: reviewing the publicly provided company description for an office in Rotterdam using only the given context.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:10:28
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The previous steps have been completed according to the original plan, and the results clearly confirm, based on the public company description, that there is a 'Rotterdam Office – Netherlands'. This directly answers the user's question ('我们在鹿特丹有办公室吗？') with a definitive 'yes'. Therefore, the final answer can be reported without further steps.
