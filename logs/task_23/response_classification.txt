## Guest/Public User Rules:
- IF user.is_authenticated == false THEN DENY all_access_to({CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions}); // internal chatbot is for employees only

## General Rules:

- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN

INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Confirm current user context and applicable access restrictions using provided session information, without calling any internal systems, to ensure only publicly available information is used to answer whether the company has an office in Rotterdam.
Approach: Read the provided context block for the current actor, which explicitly states that the user is a GUEST (Anonymous/Public user) with is_public set to true and no employee_id. Based on this, determine that internal systems such as CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, and InternalWiki, as well as any internal ChatbotActions, must not be accessed. Record the derived flags (is_public, effective_role, and whether internal systems access is allowed). No API calls are made; this step is purely interpretive from the given text.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "is_public": { "type": "boolean" }, "effective_role": { "type": "string" }, "allowed_internal_access": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["is_public", "effective_role", "allowed_internal_access"] }
**Result:** 已根据提供的会话信息完成用户上下文和访问限制确认。用户为未认证的公开访客（GUEST），禁止访问所有内部系统。此步骤未调用任何内部系统API。

{
  "is_public": true,
  "effective_role": "guest",
  "allowed_internal_access": false
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Review the publicly provided company description text to determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. has an office located in Rotterdam.
Approach: Use only the company description supplied in the task context (not any internal systems) and scan the list of locations (Headquarters and Italian Factory, Serbian Factory, Munich Office, Paris Office, Rotterdam Office, Barcelona Office, Vienna Office). Perform the search for the term "Rotterdam" and related phrases using exact match first. If needed, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings, spacing, or language variants (for example, different spellings of Rotterdam, abbreviations, or partial matches). Confirm whether there is an entry that clearly indicates an office in Rotterdam and collect the exact matched location strings in a list.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found_office": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_locations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["found_office", "matched_locations"] }
**Result:** 已根据公开的公司描述文本完成对鹿特丹办公室的查找。通过扫描地点列表并进行精确匹配，确认公司设有鹿特丹办公室。

{
  "found_office": true,
  "matched_locations": ["Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"]
}

### Final Result
是，根据公开的公司描述，Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.确实在鹿特丹（荷兰）设有办公室。

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPANY POLICIES CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST APPLY: All public/guest responses must include a mention of 'Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.' as company name in the answer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user requested information about company office locations, not any critical or destructive action (like data deletion), so this does not apply.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The system supports querying for company office locations using public data, and no missing functionality is reported.

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user is public, but the information requested is permitted to be shared from public company description, so insufficient rights do not apply.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user's query is clear and all information required to answer is available.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The task is clear: the user asked a yes/no question about a publicly listed office location.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: No technical errors occurred in processing or data retrieval.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The requested object (Rotterdam office) was found in the public list of company locations.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: The question was answered fully and correctly based on available public data, and the required public user company mention rule was followed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-25
Current actor: GUEST (Anonymous/Public user)

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
