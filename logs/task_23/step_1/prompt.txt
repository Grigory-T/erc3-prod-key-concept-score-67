Step 1: Confirm current user context and applicable access restrictions using provided session information, without calling any internal systems, to ensure only publicly available information is used to answer whether the company has an office in Rotterdam.
Approach: Read the provided context block for the current actor, which explicitly states that the user is a GUEST (Anonymous/Public user) with is_public set to true and no employee_id. Based on this, determine that internal systems such as CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, and InternalWiki, as well as any internal ChatbotActions, must not be accessed. Record the derived flags (is_public, effective_role, and whether internal systems access is allowed). No API calls are made; this step is purely interpretive from the given text.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "is_public": { "type": "boolean" }, "effective_role": { "type": "string" }, "allowed_internal_access": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["is_public", "effective_role", "allowed_internal_access"] }
