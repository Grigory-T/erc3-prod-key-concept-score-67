Step 2: Review the publicly provided company description text to determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. has an office located in Rotterdam.
Approach: Use only the company description supplied in the task context (not any internal systems) and scan the list of locations (Headquarters and Italian Factory, Serbian Factory, Munich Office, Paris Office, Rotterdam Office, Barcelona Office, Vienna Office). Perform the search for the term "Rotterdam" and related phrases using exact match first. If needed, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings, spacing, or language variants (for example, different spellings of Rotterdam, abbreviations, or partial matches). Confirm whether there is an entry that clearly indicates an office in Rotterdam and collect the exact matched location strings in a list.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found_office": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_locations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["found_office", "matched_locations"] }
