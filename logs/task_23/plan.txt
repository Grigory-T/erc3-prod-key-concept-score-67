Steps:
  1. Confirm current user context and applicable access restrictions using provided session information, without calling any internal systems, to ensure only publicly available information is used to answer whether the company has an office in Rotterdam.
     Approach: Read the provided context block for the current actor, which explicitly states that the user is a GUEST (Anonymous/Public user) with is_public set to true and no employee_id. Based on this, determine that internal systems such as CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, and InternalWiki, as well as any internal ChatbotActions, must not be accessed. Record the derived flags (is_public, effective_role, and whether internal systems access is allowed). No API calls are made; this step is purely interpretive from the given text.
     Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "is_public": { "type": "boolean" }, "effective_role": { "type": "string" }, "allowed_internal_access": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["is_public", "effective_role", "allowed_internal_access"] }
  2. Review the publicly provided company description text to determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. has an office located in Rotterdam.
     Approach: Use only the company description supplied in the task context (not any internal systems) and scan the list of locations (Headquarters and Italian Factory, Serbian Factory, Munich Office, Paris Office, Rotterdam Office, Barcelona Office, Vienna Office). Perform the search for the term "Rotterdam" and related phrases using exact match first. If needed, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings, spacing, or language variants (for example, different spellings of Rotterdam, abbreviations, or partial matches). Confirm whether there is an entry that clearly indicates an office in Rotterdam and collect the exact matched location strings in a list.
     Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found_office": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_locations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["found_office", "matched_locations"] }
  3. Based on whether a Rotterdam office was found in the public company description, derive and state the final yes/no answer to the question "Do we have an office in Rotterdam?"
     Approach: Take the boolean result from step 2 (found_office). If found_office is true, set the final answer string to "yes". If found_office is false, set the final answer string to "no". Optionally include brief reasoning referencing the matched_locations from step 2, but do not introduce any new data sources beyond the provided description.
     Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "answer": { "type": "string", "enum": ["yes", "no"] }, "reasoning": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["answer", "reasoning"] }
