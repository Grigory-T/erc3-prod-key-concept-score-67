Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by calling who_am_i() to verify the current user's identity and permissions. I confirmed that the current user (Alessandro Romano, ID: BwFV_133) is authenticated (is_public=False) and works in the HR department at HQ – Italy. Using the resolution_status and target_employee_id from Step 3, I verified that: (1) reading the department field is allowed as it's in the allowed public employee profile fields, (2) salary and HR notes are not being accessed, and (3) the user is an authenticated employee. According to company rules, department is an allowed field for all authenticated employees when accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "BwFV_133",
  "can_view_department": true,
  "reason": "Department is an allowed field for all authenticated employees when accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot"
}
