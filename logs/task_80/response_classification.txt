## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Parse the user task to extract the target employee reference string ('Giorgio') as the search term for the employee directory.
Approach: Programmatically analyze the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio" and extract the person reference. Identify that "Giorgio" is the only person-like token and store it as the search_term to be used in later steps when querying the employee table. No database or external system access is performed in this step; this step only prepares structured input for subsequent actions.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"search_term": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["search_term"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 1 by programmatically analyzing the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio". I identified "Giorgio" as the person reference token and extracted it as the search term. This step did not involve any database or external system access, and no state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived directly from the task text.

{"search_term": "Giorgio"}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search the employee table for candidate records that correspond to the extracted name reference 'Giorgio'.
Approach: Use the search_term from Step 1 to query the employee table. First, attempt an exact match on employee.name (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search using partial string containment (after normalizing to lowercase and trimming whitespace), then use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical matching to account for possible typos, misspellings, alternative spellings, or additional name components (e.g., 'Giorgio Bianchi', 'Giorgio-Rossi'). Ensure searching explicitly supports FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching, and consider that the name may appear in different fields or formats. If needed, list all employees and apply the fuzzy matching logic in-memory. Collect all candidate employees with a reasonable match score without yet deciding which one is the final target.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidates"]}
**Result:** I have completed the verification of Step 2. My additional verification revealed:

1. **Step execution**: Yes, I fully executed the step instruction by searching for employees matching 'Giorgio'.

2. **Actions verified**: 
   - Checked exact case-insensitive name match: No exact matches found
   - Performed substring matching: Found 1 candidate (Giorgio Pellegrini)
   - Performed comprehensive fuzzy matching: No fuzzy matches with ratio > 0.6 were found
   - Checked email fields: No matches found with 'giorgio' in email
   - Checked semantic variations: Found 1 match for 'giorgio', 2 matches for 'giorgi'
   - Verified no exact name 'Giorgio' exists

3. **Facts verified from function returns**:
   - Total employees: 154 (from list_all_employees())
   - Substring match: Giorgio Pellegrini (ID: BwFV_134) with 'giorgio' in the name
   - Semantic variation 'giorgi' matches: 2 employees (but these are different from 'giorgio')
   - No email matches with 'giorgio'
   - No fuzzy matches above threshold 0.6

**Important finding**: The verification revealed 2 matches for the semantic variation 'giorgi' (without the 'o'), which are different from the 'giorgio' match. However, since the search term is specifically 'Giorgio' (with 'o'), and the step requires matching the extracted name reference 'Giorgio', I should focus only on the 'giorgio' matches. The 'giorgi' matches represent a different name variation.

**Final candidate list**: Only Giorgio Pellegrini qualifies as a candidate for the search term 'Giorgio' based on:
- Substring match score: 0.9
- No other employees contain 'giorgio' in their name
- No fuzzy matches above reasonable threshold

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_134",
      "name": "Giorgio Pellegrini",
      "email": null,
      "location": null,
      "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
      "match_score": 0.9
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Disambiguate the target employee 'Giorgio' using the list of candidate employees and decide whether there is a unique match, multiple matches, or no match.
Approach: Inspect the candidates list from Step 2. If the list is empty, set resolution_status to 'not_found'. If the list contains exactly one candidate, set resolution_status to 'unique_match' and select that employee_id as target_employee_id. If there are multiple candidates, apply only simple ranking such as highest match_score, but do not auto-select; instead, set resolution_status to 'multiple_matches' and provide the list of candidates to signal that further clarification from the user will be required. Do not query any new systems in this step; this is purely a decision step over the existing candidate data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"resolution_status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["unique_match", "multiple_matches", "not_found"]}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["resolution_status", "target_employee_id", "candidates"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction by inspecting the candidate list from Step 2 which contained exactly one employee matching "Giorgio". I set resolution_status to "unique_match" and selected the employee_id BwFV_134 as target_employee_id. I prepared the output candidates array with the required fields (employee_id, name, match_score). No new system queries were performed in this step, as instructed. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "resolution_status": "unique_match",
  "target_employee_id": "BwFV_134",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_134",
      "name": "Giorgio Pellegrini",
      "match_score": 0.9
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (who_am_i) to confirm that reading the department field of the resolved employee is allowed.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity lookup to confirm the current authenticated user is Alessandro Romano (employee_id 'BwFV_133') with department 'Human Resources (HR)' and location 'HQ – Italy'. Using the resolution_status and target_employee_id from Step 3, verify that: (1) the request is to read only allowed public employee profile fields (name, email, location, department, and possibly a context-relevant subset of skills/wills), (2) salary and HR notes are not being accessed, and (3) the user is an authenticated employee, which satisfies the policy for reading the department field of any employee. Based on these checks, determine whether the action to read the department for target_employee_id (if resolution_status is 'unique_match') is permitted.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "can_view_department": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "can_view_department", "reason"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by calling who_am_i() to verify the current user's identity and permissions. I confirmed that the current user (Alessandro Romano, ID: BwFV_133) is authenticated (is_public=False) and works in the HR department at HQ – Italy. Using the resolution_status and target_employee_id from Step 3, I verified that: (1) reading the department field is allowed as it's in the allowed public employee profile fields, (2) salary and HR notes are not being accessed, and (3) the user is an authenticated employee. According to company rules, department is an allowed field for all authenticated employees when accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "BwFV_133",
  "can_view_department": true,
  "reason": "Department is an allowed field for all authenticated employees when accessing EmployeeProfile via chatbot"
}

### Final Result
Giorgio Pellegrini works in the Human Resources (HR) department.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
