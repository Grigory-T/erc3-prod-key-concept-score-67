Step 2: Search the employee table for candidate records that correspond to the extracted name reference 'Giorgio'.
Approach: Use the search_term from Step 1 to query the employee table. First, attempt an exact match on employee.name (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search using partial string containment (after normalizing to lowercase and trimming whitespace), then use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical matching to account for possible typos, misspellings, alternative spellings, or additional name components (e.g., 'Giorgio Bianchi', 'Giorgio-Rossi'). Ensure searching explicitly supports FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching, and consider that the name may appear in different fields or formats. If needed, list all employees and apply the fuzzy matching logic in-memory. Collect all candidate employees with a reasonable match score without yet deciding which one is the final target.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidates"]}
