## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-27
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_133
User details: {"id": "BwFV_133", "name": "Alessandro Romano", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** What is the department of Giorgio

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Parse the user task to extract the target employee reference string ('Giorgio') as the search term for the employee directory.
Approach: Programmatically analyze the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio" and extract the person reference. Identify that "Giorgio" is the only person-like token and store it as the search_term to be used in later steps when querying the employee table. No database or external system access is performed in this step; this step only prepares structured input for subsequent actions.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"search_term": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["search_term"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 1 by programmatically analyzing the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio". I identified "Giorgio" as the person reference token and extracted it as the search term. This step did not involve any database or external system access, and no state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived directly from the task text.

{"search_term": "Giorgio"}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search the employee table for candidate records that correspond to the extracted name reference 'Giorgio'.
Approach: Use the search_term from Step 1 to query the employee table. First, attempt an exact match on employee.name (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search using partial string containment (after normalizing to lowercase and trimming whitespace), then use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical matching to account for possible typos, misspellings, alternative spellings, or additional name components (e.g., 'Giorgio Bianchi', 'Giorgio-Rossi'). Ensure searching explicitly supports FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching, and consider that the name may appear in different fields or formats. If needed, list all employees and apply the fuzzy matching logic in-memory. Collect all candidate employees with a reasonable match score without yet deciding which one is the final target.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidates"]}
**Result:** I have completed the verification of Step 2. My additional verification revealed:

1. **Step execution**: Yes, I fully executed the step instruction by searching for employees matching 'Giorgio'.

2. **Actions verified**: 
   - Checked exact case-insensitive name match: No exact matches found
   - Performed substring matching: Found 1 candidate (Giorgio Pellegrini)
   - Performed comprehensive fuzzy matching: No fuzzy matches with ratio > 0.6 were found
   - Checked email fields: No matches found with 'giorgio' in email
   - Checked semantic variations: Found 1 match for 'giorgio', 2 matches for 'giorgi'
   - Verified no exact name 'Giorgio' exists

3. **Facts verified from function returns**:
   - Total employees: 154 (from list_all_employees())
   - Substring match: Giorgio Pellegrini (ID: BwFV_134) with 'giorgio' in the name
   - Semantic variation 'giorgi' matches: 2 employees (but these are different from 'giorgio')
   - No email matches with 'giorgio'
   - No fuzzy matches above threshold 0.6

**Important finding**: The verification revealed 2 matches for the semantic variation 'giorgi' (without the 'o'), which are different from the 'giorgio' match. However, since the search term is specifically 'Giorgio' (with 'o'), and the step requires matching the extracted name reference 'Giorgio', I should focus only on the 'giorgio' matches. The 'giorgi' matches represent a different name variation.

**Final candidate list**: Only Giorgio Pellegrini qualifies as a candidate for the search term 'Giorgio' based on:
- Substring match score: 0.9
- No other employees contain 'giorgio' in their name
- No fuzzy matches above reasonable threshold

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_134",
      "name": "Giorgio Pellegrini",
      "email": null,
      "location": null,
      "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
      "match_score": 0.9
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Disambiguate the target employee 'Giorgio' using the list of candidate employees and decide whether there is a unique match, multiple matches, or no match.
Approach: Inspect the candidates list from Step 2. If the list is empty, set resolution_status to 'not_found'. If the list contains exactly one candidate, set resolution_status to 'unique_match' and select that employee_id as target_employee_id. If there are multiple candidates, apply only simple ranking such as highest match_score, but do not auto-select; instead, set resolution_status to 'multiple_matches' and provide the list of candidates to signal that further clarification from the user will be required. Do not query any new systems in this step; this is purely a decision step over the existing candidate data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"resolution_status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["unique_match", "multiple_matches", "not_found"]}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["resolution_status", "target_employee_id", "candidates"]}

<final_answer>
Step 3 completed. I analyzed the candidate list from Step 2 which contained exactly one employee matching "Giorgio": Giorgio Pellegrini (ID: BwFV_134) with a match score of 0.9. Since there is only one candidate, I set the resolution_status to "unique_match" and selected BwFV_134 as the target_employee_id. No new system queries were performed in this step, as instructed.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Disambiguate the target employee 'Giorgio' using the list of candidate employees and decide whether there is a unique match, multiple matches, or no match.
Approach: Inspect the candidates list from Step 2. If the list is empty, set resolution_status to 'not_found'. If the list contains exactly one candidate, set resolution_status to 'unique_match' and select that employee_id as target_employee_id. If there are multiple candidates, apply only simple ranking such as highest match_score, but do not auto-select; instead, set resolution_status to 'multiple_matches' and provide the list of candidates to signal that further clarification from the user will be required. Do not query any new systems in this step; this is purely a decision step over the existing candidate data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"resolution_status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["unique_match", "multiple_matches", "not_found"]}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["resolution_status", "target_employee_id", "candidates"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction by inspecting the candidate list from Step 2 which contained exactly one employee matching "Giorgio". I set resolution_status to "unique_match" and selected the employee_id BwFV_134 as target_employee_id. I prepared the output candidates array with the required fields (employee_id, name, match_score). No new system queries were performed in this step, as instructed. No state-changing operations were performed.

<json>
{
  "resolution_status": "unique_match",
  "target_employee_id": "BwFV_134",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_134",
      "name": "Giorgio Pellegrini",
      "match_score": 0.9
    }
  ]
}</json>
