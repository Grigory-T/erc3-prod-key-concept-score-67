Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction by inspecting the candidate list from Step 2 which contained exactly one employee matching "Giorgio". I set resolution_status to "unique_match" and selected the employee_id BwFV_134 as target_employee_id. I prepared the output candidates array with the required fields (employee_id, name, match_score). No new system queries were performed in this step, as instructed. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "resolution_status": "unique_match",
  "target_employee_id": "BwFV_134",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_134",
      "name": "Giorgio Pellegrini",
      "match_score": 0.9
    }
  ]
}
