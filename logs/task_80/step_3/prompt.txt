Step 3: Disambiguate the target employee 'Giorgio' using the list of candidate employees and decide whether there is a unique match, multiple matches, or no match.
Approach: Inspect the candidates list from Step 2. If the list is empty, set resolution_status to 'not_found'. If the list contains exactly one candidate, set resolution_status to 'unique_match' and select that employee_id as target_employee_id. If there are multiple candidates, apply only simple ranking such as highest match_score, but do not auto-select; instead, set resolution_status to 'multiple_matches' and provide the list of candidates to signal that further clarification from the user will be required. Do not query any new systems in this step; this is purely a decision step over the existing candidate data.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"resolution_status": {"type": "string", "enum": ["unique_match", "multiple_matches", "not_found"]}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidates": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["resolution_status", "target_employee_id", "candidates"]}
