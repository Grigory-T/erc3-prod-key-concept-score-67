Step 1: Parse the user task to extract the target employee reference string ('Giorgio') as the search term for the employee directory.
Approach: Programmatically analyze the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio" and extract the person reference. Identify that "Giorgio" is the only person-like token and store it as the search_term to be used in later steps when querying the employee table. No database or external system access is performed in this step; this step only prepares structured input for subsequent actions.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"search_term": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["search_term"]}
