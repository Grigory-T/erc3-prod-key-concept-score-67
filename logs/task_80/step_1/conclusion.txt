I executed Step 1 by programmatically analyzing the plain text of the task "What is the department of Giorgio". I identified "Giorgio" as the person reference token and extracted it as the search term. This step did not involve any database or external system access, and no state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived directly from the task text.

{"search_term": "Giorgio"}
