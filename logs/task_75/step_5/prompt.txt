Step 5: Determine the minimum German language skill level across all employees who have a German skill entry, and identify the list of candidate employees with that minimum level.
Approach: From the German language skill records obtained in Step 4, compute the minimum value of level (an integer between 1 and 5) across all rows. Then filter the list to include only those employees whose German skill level equals this minimum level. Note that employees who have no German language entry in employee_skill are not considered because their skill level in German is not explicitly recorded. Return the minimum level and the set of unique employee_ids whose German skill matches this minimum.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "min_level": { "type": "integer" }, "candidate_employees": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["min_level", "candidate_employees"] }
