STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 23:20:20

Step 5 completed successfully with all facts verified from function returns:

1. **Data Source Verified**: Used `list_all_employees()` to get all 154 employees, then `get_employee()` for each to retrieve skill data.

2. **Minimum Level Calculation Verified**: The code explicitly calculated `min(german_skill_levels)` from the actual data, resulting in level 2.

3. **Candidate Identification Verified**: Filtered the list to find employees with level 2, resulting in 20 candidates.

4. **Verification Check Performed**: Verified the first 3 candidates by calling `get_employee()` again and confirming their German skill level is indeed 2.

5. **All Data Verified**: No assumptions or made-up data used. All values come directly from function returns:
   - 154 total employees (printed from `list_all_employees()`)
   - 154 German skill entries (counted from actual `get_employee()` calls)
   - Skill levels range 2-10 (from actual skill.level values)
   - Minimum level 2 (calculated from actual data)
   - 20 candidates with level 2 (identified from actual data)

6. **No State Changes**: Only read operations (`list_all_employees()`, `get_employee()`) were used. No update functions were called.

The JSON output contains only values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
