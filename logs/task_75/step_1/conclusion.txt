Step 1 completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() and retrieved the current user's core attributes. However, the system_roles field is not available through the current API functions. The WhoAmI object only contains: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, and wiki_sha1. The EmployeeFull object (from get_employee) contains: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, and wills. Neither model includes a system_roles field. I cannot retrieve system_roles with the available functions, so I'm returning an empty array as required by the output schema. All other fields were explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "name": "Laura Pellegrini",
  "email": "ayEi_001@bellini.internal",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
