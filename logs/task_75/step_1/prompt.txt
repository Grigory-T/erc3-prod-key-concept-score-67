Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee identity and core attributes for user 'ayEi_001' using a who_am_i or equivalent identity lookup, to know who is requesting the search for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Call the identity or employee registry service (for example, who_am_i) to retrieve the current user record based on the authenticated session. Do not perform any writes. Retrieve only non-sensitive fields: employee id, full name, email, department, location, and system roles. Ensure this step does not touch salary or human resources notes. No fuzzy search is needed here because the current user id is bound by the session and should match exactly.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"] }
