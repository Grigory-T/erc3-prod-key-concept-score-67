Step 4: Retrieve all German language skill records for all employees, including the precise skill name string and level for each entry, using fuzzy and semantic matching for the German language skill name.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name corresponds to the German language. Because "German language" could be recorded with slight variations or abbreviations (for example, 'German', 'Deutsch', 'DE', 'DE language', possible misspellings), perform a two-stage search: (1) exact and case-insensitive filter where LOWER(skill_name) equals or contains 'german' or 'deutsch'; (2) if needed, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical matching (for example, using fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to find additional relevant skill_name values that closely resemble or are semantically related to German language, taking into account typos and partial matches. Collect all matching rows with fields employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not include skills where skill_type = 'will'.
Expected Output: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "skill_name": { "type": "string" }, "level": { "type": "integer" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "skill_name", "level"] } }
