  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-24
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee identity and core attributes for user 'ayEi_001' using a who_am_i or equivalent identity lookup, to know who is requesting the search for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Call the identity or employee registry service (for example, who_am_i) to retrieve the current user record based on the authenticated session. Do not perform any writes. Retrieve only non-sensitive fields: employee id, full name, email, department, location, and system roles. Ensure this step does not touch salary or human resources notes. No fuzzy search is needed here because the current user id is bound by the session and should match exactly.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"] }
**Result:** Step 1 completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() and retrieved the current user's core attributes. However, the system_roles field is not available through the current API functions. The WhoAmI object only contains: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, and wiki_sha1. The EmployeeFull object (from get_employee) contains: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, and wills. Neither model includes a system_roles field. I cannot retrieve system_roles with the available functions, so I'm returning an empty array as required by the output schema. All other fields were explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "name": "Laura Pellegrini",
  "email": "ayEi_001@bellini.internal",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read skills and project participation data for all employees, ensuring compliance with company rules before searching for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), evaluate authorization rules: confirm that reading cross-employee skills (from employee_skill) and project participation (from team_member and project) is allowed for this user, while explicitly excluding any access to salary or confidential human resources notes from the employee table. Implement this as a policy-engine or rules check based on system_roles (for example, general employees may read shared skill metadata, executives may have broader access). If access is denied, do not proceed further with the task.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "authorized": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["authorized"] }
**Result:** The permission check for Step 2 has been completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() to verify the current user's authentication status and department. The function returns showed: current user "ayEi_001", department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy", and is_public=False (authenticated). 

Based on explicit company rules analysis:
1. Authenticated User Rules state that for EmployeeProfile accessed via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes "context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)"
2. Query types like SearchBySkill are explicitly allowed, returning lists of employees with fields {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} only
3. Project participation data can be accessed through project queries which don't have explicit restrictions for reading team membership
4. The task requires reading skills and project work data only, not salary or confidential HR notes

The verification confirmed all facts from function returns: user is authenticated and in Corporate Leadership department. No assumptions were made about system_roles since they're not available via the API, but the chatbot access rules explicitly permit skill reading for all authenticated users.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "authorized": true,
  "denial_reason": ""
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify and confirm the relevant data sources and query interfaces needed to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.
Approach: Inspect the available structured data schema and confirm that: (1) German language skill levels are stored in the employee_skill table using fields employee_id, skill_name, level, and skill_type; (2) project participation for employees is stored in the team_member table using fields employee_id and project_id; and (3) non-sensitive employee details (name, email, location, department) are stored in the employee table, while explicitly avoiding use of the salary and notes fields. Confirm that these tables are accessible via standard Structured Query Language (SQL) or the equivalent data access layer. No fuzzy search is required here because table and column names are exactly defined by the schema.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "skills_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "projects_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["skills_source_confirmed", "projects_source_confirmed", "employee_source_confirmed"] }
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 according to the instructions and verified all required data sources through actual function calls. The verification confirmed:

1. **German language skill levels**: Confirmed via `EmployeeFull.skills` and `EmployeeFull.wills` fields, which contain `SkillLevel` objects with `name` (string) and `level` (integer) attributes. The sample employee `ayEi_001` has 15 skills and 6 wills, and language-related terms including 'german' and 'english' were found in their skill/will names.

2. **Project participation for employees**: Confirmed via `ProjectFull.team` field, which contains `TeamMember` objects with `employee` (ID string), `time_slice` (float), and `role` (string) attributes. The sample project `proj_ferro_rail_bogie_anticorrosion` has 4 team members, demonstrating the project participation structure.

3. **Non-sensitive employee details**: Confirmed via `EmployeeBrief` and `EmployeeFull` objects, which provide `id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, and `department` fields. The sample employee shows all these non-sensitive fields are accessible, while `salary` and `notes` fields exist but are excluded as per company rules.

All data sources are accessible through the provided API functions, which serve as the equivalent data access layer. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "skills_source_confirmed": true,
  "projects_source_confirmed": true,
  "employee_source_confirmed": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all German language skill records for all employees, including the precise skill name string and level for each entry, using fuzzy and semantic matching for the German language skill name.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name corresponds to the German language. Because "German language" could be recorded with slight variations or abbreviations (for example, 'German', 'Deutsch', 'DE', 'DE language', possible misspellings), perform a two-stage search: (1) exact and case-insensitive filter where LOWER(skill_name) equals or contains 'german' or 'deutsch'; (2) if needed, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical matching (for example, using fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to find additional relevant skill_name values that closely resemble or are semantically related to German language, taking into account typos and partial matches. Collect all matching rows with fields employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not include skills where skill_type = 'will'.
Expected Output: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "skill_name": { "type": "string" }, "level": { "type": "integer" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "skill_name", "level"] } }
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's the verification against the checklist:

**Step Execution Verification:**
1. ✅ **Two-stage search performed:** Exact/case-insensitive filtering (checking for 'german', 'deutsch', etc. in skill names) followed by fuzzy matching (using fuzzy_compare with 0.8 threshold).
2. ✅ **Only skills (not wills) included:** We processed only the `skills` list from EmployeeFull objects, excluding `wills` as required.
3. ✅ **All employees processed:** We retrieved all 154 employees using `list_all_employees()` and examined each one's skills.
4. ✅ **All facts verified from function returns:** Every record comes from actual `get_employee()` calls and skill data. The printed output shows 154 records with exact values.
5. ✅ **No state-changing operations:** Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.
6. ✅ **Semantic matching considered:** We used fuzzy matching and broader language indicators to catch variations, though none were found beyond 'skill_german'.

**Key Finding:** Every single employee (154/154) has exactly one German language skill recorded with the name 'skill_german'. No variations or alternative skill names for German language were found. Skill levels range from 2 to 10.

The JSON output contains exactly the 154 records retrieved, with each record including the verified employee_id, skill_name string, and level integer from the actual function returns.

]

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the minimum German language skill level across all employees who have a German skill entry, and identify the list of candidate employees with that minimum level.
Approach: From the German language skill records obtained in Step 4, compute the minimum value of level (an integer between 1 and 5) across all rows. Then filter the list to include only those employees whose German skill level equals this minimum level. Note that employees who have no German language entry in employee_skill are not considered because their skill level in German is not explicitly recorded. Return the minimum level and the set of unique employee_ids whose German skill matches this minimum.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "min_level": { "type": "integer" }, "candidate_employees": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["min_level", "candidate_employees"] }
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully with all facts verified from function returns:

1. **Data Source Verified**: Used `list_all_employees()` to get all 154 employees, then `get_employee()` for each to retrieve skill data.

2. **Minimum Level Calculation Verified**: The code explicitly calculated `min(german_skill_levels)` from the actual data, resulting in level 2.

3. **Candidate Identification Verified**: Filtered the list to find employees with level 2, resulting in 20 candidates.

4. **Verification Check Performed**: Verified the first 3 candidates by calling `get_employee()` again and confirming their German skill level is indeed 2.

5. **All Data Verified**: No assumptions or made-up data used. All values come directly from function returns:
   - 154 total employees (printed from `list_all_employees()`)
   - 154 German skill entries (counted from actual `get_employee()` calls)
   - Skill levels range 2-10 (from actual skill.level values)
   - Minimum level 2 (calculated from actual data)
   - 20 candidates with level 2 (identified from actual data)

6. **No State Changes**: Only read operations (`list_all_employees()`, `get_employee()`) were used. No update functions were called.

The JSON output contains only values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.

  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: For the candidate employees with the minimum German level, compute their project work and select the least skilled person in German language who has the highest amount of project work, then return their non-sensitive employee details.
Approach: Take the candidate employee_ids from Step 5. For each candidate, query the team_member table to count the number of distinct project_id values where that employee_id appears, interpreting a higher count as more project work. Implement this using exact matches on employee_id, and if any ids need to be matched across systems, allow fuzzy matching only as a fallback while double-checking results to avoid mis-association. Identify the employee(s) with the maximum project count among the candidates. If there is a single employee with the highest project_count, select that employee as the final answer. If multiple candidates are tied both in German level and project_count, break ties deterministically (for example, by choosing the employee with lexicographically smallest employee_id) to return exactly one person. Finally, query the employee table for this selected employee_id to retrieve only non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department) while explicitly excluding salary and notes. Return the selected employee's id, name, German skill level, project_count, and basic attributes.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "german_skill_level": { "type": "integer" }, "project_count": { "type": "integer" } }, "required": ["found"] }
**Result:** Step 6 completed successfully and all checklist items have been verified:

1. ✅ **Executed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Took the 20 candidate employee_ids from Step 5 (employees with German skill level 2)
   - For each candidate, counted distinct projects using `search_projects(team_employee=emp_id)` 
   - Identified employee(s) with maximum project count (ayEi_045 with 3 projects)
   - Since only one employee had the maximum count, selected that employee
   - Retrieved non-sensitive employee details using `get_employee(selected_emp_id)`

2. ✅ **No actions skipped or assumed**:
   - Used exact matches on employee_id (no fuzzy matching needed as IDs are exact)
   - Counted all projects including archived ones (`include_archived=True`)
   - Retrieved actual German skill level from employee.skills for verification
   - All data comes from function returns, no assumptions made

3. ✅ **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Project counts: Printed for each candidate (0-3 projects)
   - Employee details: Printed from `get_employee()` call
   - German skill level: Verified from employee.skills list (skill_german with level 2)
   - Project count: Verified from search_projects results

4. ✅ **JSON contains only explicitly printed/verified values**:
   - `employee_id`: "ayEi_045" (from selection logic)
   - `name`: "Giorgio Pellegrini" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `email`: "ayEi_045@bellini.internal" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `location`: "HQ – Italy" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `department`: "R&D and Technical Service" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `german_skill_level`: 2 (from employee.skills verification)
   - `project_count`: 3 (from project counting logic)

5. ✅ **No made-up data or sensible defaults used**: All values come from actual function returns

6. ✅ **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations (`search_projects`, `get_employee`) were used

The least skilled person in German language (level 2) with the highest project work is Giorgio Pellegrini (ayEi_045) with 3 projects.

## User (agent is acting on behalf of this User)
employee_id: ayEi_001, is_public: False , department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy

## Original Task
Find me the least skilled person in German language (pick the one with more project work, if multiple match)

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee identity and core attributes for user 'ayEi_001' using a who_am_i or equivalent identity lookup, to know who is requesting the search for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Call the identity or employee registry service (for example, who_am_i) to retrieve the current user record based on the authenticated session. Do not perform any writes. Retrieve only non-sensitive fields: employee id, full name, email, department, location, and system roles. Ensure this step does not touch salary or human resources notes. No fuzzy search is needed here because the current user id is bound by the session and should match exactly.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"] }
**Result:** Step 1 completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() and retrieved the current user's core attributes. However, the system_roles field is not available through the current API functions. The WhoAmI object only contains: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, and wiki_sha1. The EmployeeFull object (from get_employee) contains: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, and wills. Neither model includes a system_roles field. I cannot retrieve system_roles with the available functions, so I'm returning an empty array as required by the output schema. All other fields were explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "name": "Laura Pellegrini",
  "email": "ayEi_001@bellini.internal",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read skills and project participation data for all employees, ensuring compliance with company rules before searching for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), evaluate authorization rules: confirm that reading cross-employee skills (from employee_skill) and project participation (from team_member and project) is allowed for this user, while explicitly excluding any access to salary or confidential human resources notes from the employee table. Implement this as a policy-engine or rules check based on system_roles (for example, general employees may read shared skill metadata, executives may have broader access). If access is denied, do not proceed further with the task.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "authorized": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["authorized"] }
**Result:** The permission check for Step 2 has been completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() to verify the current user's authentication status and department. The function returns showed: current user "ayEi_001", department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy", and is_public=False (authenticated). 

Based on explicit company rules analysis:
1. Authenticated User Rules state that for EmployeeProfile accessed via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes "context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)"
2. Query types like SearchBySkill are explicitly allowed, returning lists of employees with fields {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} only
3. Project participation data can be accessed through project queries which don't have explicit restrictions for reading team membership
4. The task requires reading skills and project work data only, not salary or confidential HR notes

The verification confirmed all facts from function returns: user is authenticated and in Corporate Leadership department. No assumptions were made about system_roles since they're not available via the API, but the chatbot access rules explicitly permit skill reading for all authenticated users.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "authorized": true,
  "denial_reason": ""
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify and confirm the relevant data sources and query interfaces needed to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.
Approach: Inspect the available structured data schema and confirm that: (1) German language skill levels are stored in the employee_skill table using fields employee_id, skill_name, level, and skill_type; (2) project participation for employees is stored in the team_member table using fields employee_id and project_id; and (3) non-sensitive employee details (name, email, location, department) are stored in the employee table, while explicitly avoiding use of the salary and notes fields. Confirm that these tables are accessible via standard Structured Query Language (SQL) or the equivalent data access layer. No fuzzy search is required here because table and column names are exactly defined by the schema.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "skills_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "projects_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["skills_source_confirmed", "projects_source_confirmed", "employee_source_confirmed"] }
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 according to the instructions and verified all required data sources through actual function calls. The verification confirmed:

1. **German language skill levels**: Confirmed via `EmployeeFull.skills` and `EmployeeFull.wills` fields, which contain `SkillLevel` objects with `name` (string) and `level` (integer) attributes. The sample employee `ayEi_001` has 15 skills and 6 wills, and language-related terms including 'german' and 'english' were found in their skill/will names.

2. **Project participation for employees**: Confirmed via `ProjectFull.team` field, which contains `TeamMember` objects with `employee` (ID string), `time_slice` (float), and `role` (string) attributes. The sample project `proj_ferro_rail_bogie_anticorrosion` has 4 team members, demonstrating the project participation structure.

3. **Non-sensitive employee details**: Confirmed via `EmployeeBrief` and `EmployeeFull` objects, which provide `id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, and `department` fields. The sample employee shows all these non-sensitive fields are accessible, while `salary` and `notes` fields exist but are excluded as per company rules.

All data sources are accessible through the provided API functions, which serve as the equivalent data access layer. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "skills_source_confirmed": true,
  "projects_source_confirmed": true,
  "employee_source_confirmed": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all German language skill records for all employees, including the precise skill name string and level for each entry, using fuzzy and semantic matching for the German language skill name.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name corresponds to the German language. Because "German language" could be recorded with slight variations or abbreviations (for example, 'German', 'Deutsch', 'DE', 'DE language', possible misspellings), perform a two-stage search: (1) exact and case-insensitive filter where LOWER(skill_name) equals or contains 'german' or 'deutsch'; (2) if needed, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical matching (for example, using fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to find additional relevant skill_name values that closely resemble or are semantically related to German language, taking into account typos and partial matches. Collect all matching rows with fields employee_id, skill_name, and level. Do not include skills where skill_type = 'will'.
Expected Output: { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "skill_name": { "type": "string" }, "level": { "type": "integer" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "skill_name", "level"] } }
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's the verification against the checklist:

**Step Execution Verification:**
1. ✅ **Two-stage search performed:** Exact/case-insensitive filtering (checking for 'german', 'deutsch', etc. in skill names) followed by fuzzy matching (using fuzzy_compare with 0.8 threshold).
2. ✅ **Only skills (not wills) included:** We processed only the `skills` list from EmployeeFull objects, excluding `wills` as required.
3. ✅ **All employees processed:** We retrieved all 154 employees using `list_all_employees()` and examined each one's skills.
4. ✅ **All facts verified from function returns:** Every record comes from actual `get_employee()` calls and skill data. The printed output shows 154 records with exact values.
5. ✅ **No state-changing operations:** Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.
6. ✅ **Semantic matching considered:** We used fuzzy matching and broader language indicators to catch variations, though none were found beyond 'skill_german'.

**Key Finding:** Every single employee (154/154) has exactly one German language skill recorded with the name 'skill_german'. No variations or alternative skill names for German language were found. Skill levels range from 2 to 10.

The JSON output contains exactly the 154 records retrieved, with each record including the verified employee_id, skill_name string, and level integer from the actual function returns.

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the minimum German language skill level across all employees who have a German skill entry, and identify the list of candidate employees with that minimum level.
Approach: From the German language skill records obtained in Step 4, compute the minimum value of level (an integer between 1 and 5) across all rows. Then filter the list to include only those employees whose German skill level equals this minimum level. Note that employees who have no German language entry in employee_skill are not considered because their skill level in German is not explicitly recorded. Return the minimum level and the set of unique employee_ids whose German skill matches this minimum.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "min_level": { "type": "integer" }, "candidate_employees": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["min_level", "candidate_employees"] }
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully with all facts verified from function returns:

1. **Data Source Verified**: Used `list_all_employees()` to get all 154 employees, then `get_employee()` for each to retrieve skill data.

2. **Minimum Level Calculation Verified**: The code explicitly calculated `min(german_skill_levels)` from the actual data, resulting in level 2.

3. **Candidate Identification Verified**: Filtered the list to find employees with level 2, resulting in 20 candidates.

4. **Verification Check Performed**: Verified the first 3 candidates by calling `get_employee()` again and confirming their German skill level is indeed 2.

5. **All Data Verified**: No assumptions or made-up data used. All values come directly from function returns:
   - 154 total employees (printed from `list_all_employees()`)
   - 154 German skill entries (counted from actual `get_employee()` calls)
   - Skill levels range 2-10 (from actual skill.level values)
   - Minimum level 2 (calculated from actual data)
   - 20 candidates with level 2 (identified from actual data)

6. **No State Changes**: Only read operations (`list_all_employees()`, `get_employee()`) were used. No update functions were called.

The JSON output contains only values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.

{
  "min_level": 2,
  "candidate_employees": [
    "ayEi_045",
    "ayEi_046",
    "ayEi_049",
    "ayEi_058",
    "ayEi_065",
    "ayEi_072",
    "ayEi_080",
    "ayEi_086",

    "ayEi_134",
    "ayEi_146",
    "ayEi_149",
    "ayEi_151"
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: For the candidate employees with the minimum German level, compute their project work and select the least skilled person in German language who has the highest amount of project work, then return their non-sensitive employee details.
Approach: Take the candidate employee_ids from Step 5. For each candidate, query the team_member table to count the number of distinct project_id values where that employee_id appears, interpreting a higher count as more project work. Implement this using exact matches on employee_id, and if any ids need to be matched across systems, allow fuzzy matching only as a fallback while double-checking results to avoid mis-association. Identify the employee(s) with the maximum project count among the candidates. If there is a single employee with the highest project_count, select that employee as the final answer. If multiple candidates are tied both in German level and project_count, break ties deterministically (for example, by choosing the employee with lexicographically smallest employee_id) to return exactly one person. Finally, query the employee table for this selected employee_id to retrieve only non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department) while explicitly excluding salary and notes. Return the selected employee's id, name, German skill level, project_count, and basic attributes.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "found": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "german_skill_level": { "type": "integer" }, "project_count": { "type": "integer" } }, "required": ["found"] }
**Result:** Step 6 completed successfully and all checklist items have been verified:

1. ✅ **Executed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Took the 20 candidate employee_ids from Step 5 (employees with German skill level 2)
   - For each candidate, counted distinct projects using `search_projects(team_employee=emp_id)` 
   - Identified employee(s) with maximum project count (ayEi_045 with 3 projects)
   - Since only one employee had the maximum count, selected that employee
   - Retrieved non-sensitive employee details using `get_employee(selected_emp_id)`

2. ✅ **No actions skipped or assumed**:
   - Used exact matches on employee_id (no fuzzy matching needed as IDs are exact)
   - Counted all projects including archived ones (`include_archived=True`)
   - Retrieved actual German skill level from employee.skills for verification
   - All data comes from function returns, no assumptions made

3. ✅ **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Project counts: Printed for each candidate (0-3 projects)
   - Employee details: Printed from `get_employee()` call
   - German skill level: Verified from employee.skills list (skill_german with level 2)
   - Project count: Verified from search_projects results

4. ✅ **JSON contains only explicitly printed/verified values**:
   - `employee_id`: "ayEi_045" (from selection logic)
   - `name`: "Giorgio Pellegrini" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `email`: "ayEi_045@bellini.internal" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `location`: "HQ – Italy" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `department`: "R&D and Technical Service" (from `get_employee()`)
   - `german_skill_level`: 2 (from employee.skills verification)
   - `project_count`: 3 (from project counting logic)

5. ✅ **No made-up data or sensible defaults used**: All values come from actual function returns

6. ✅ **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations (`search_projects`, `get_employee`) were used

The least skilled person in German language (level 2) with the highest project work is Giorgio Pellegrini (ayEi_045) with 3 projects.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-24
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
