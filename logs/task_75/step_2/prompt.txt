Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read skills and project participation data for all employees, ensuring compliance with company rules before searching for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), evaluate authorization rules: confirm that reading cross-employee skills (from employee_skill) and project participation (from team_member and project) is allowed for this user, while explicitly excluding any access to salary or confidential human resources notes from the employee table. Implement this as a policy-engine or rules check based on system_roles (for example, general employees may read shared skill metadata, executives may have broader access). If access is denied, do not proceed further with the task.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "authorized": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["authorized"] }
