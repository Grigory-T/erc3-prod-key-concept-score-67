STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

The permission check for Step 2 has been completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() to verify the current user's authentication status and department. The function returns showed: current user "ayEi_001", department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy", and is_public=False (authenticated). 

Based on explicit company rules analysis:
1. Authenticated User Rules state that for EmployeeProfile accessed via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes "context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)"
2. Query types like SearchBySkill are explicitly allowed, returning lists of employees with fields {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} only
3. Project participation data can be accessed through project queries which don't have explicit restrictions for reading team membership
4. The task requires reading skills and project work data only, not salary or confidential HR notes

The verification confirmed all facts from function returns: user is authenticated and in Corporate Leadership department. No assumptions were made about system_roles since they're not available via the API, but the chatbot access rules explicitly permit skill reading for all authenticated users.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
