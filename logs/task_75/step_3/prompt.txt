Step 3: Identify and confirm the relevant data sources and query interfaces needed to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.
Approach: Inspect the available structured data schema and confirm that: (1) German language skill levels are stored in the employee_skill table using fields employee_id, skill_name, level, and skill_type; (2) project participation for employees is stored in the team_member table using fields employee_id and project_id; and (3) non-sensitive employee details (name, email, location, department) are stored in the employee table, while explicitly avoiding use of the salary and notes fields. Confirm that these tables are accessible via standard Structured Query Language (SQL) or the equivalent data access layer. No fuzzy search is required here because table and column names are exactly defined by the schema.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "skills_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "projects_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["skills_source_confirmed", "projects_source_confirmed", "employee_source_confirmed"] }
