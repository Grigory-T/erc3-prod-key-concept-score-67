I have executed Step 3 according to the instructions and verified all required data sources through actual function calls. The verification confirmed:

1. **German language skill levels**: Confirmed via `EmployeeFull.skills` and `EmployeeFull.wills` fields, which contain `SkillLevel` objects with `name` (string) and `level` (integer) attributes. The sample employee `ayEi_001` has 15 skills and 6 wills, and language-related terms including 'german' and 'english' were found in their skill/will names.

2. **Project participation for employees**: Confirmed via `ProjectFull.team` field, which contains `TeamMember` objects with `employee` (ID string), `time_slice` (float), and `role` (string) attributes. The sample project `proj_ferro_rail_bogie_anticorrosion` has 4 team members, demonstrating the project participation structure.

3. **Non-sensitive employee details**: Confirmed via `EmployeeBrief` and `EmployeeFull` objects, which provide `id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, and `department` fields. The sample employee shows all these non-sensitive fields are accessible, while `salary` and `notes` fields exist but are excluded as per company rules.

All data sources are accessible through the provided API functions, which serve as the equivalent data access layer. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
