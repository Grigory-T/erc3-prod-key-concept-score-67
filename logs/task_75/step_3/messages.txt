## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-24
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: ayEi_001
department: Corporate Leadership
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-05-24
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Find me the least skilled person in German language (pick the one with more project work, if multiple match)

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee identity and core attributes for user 'ayEi_001' using a who_am_i or equivalent identity lookup, to know who is requesting the search for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Call the identity or employee registry service (for example, who_am_i) to retrieve the current user record based on the authenticated session. Do not perform any writes. Retrieve only non-sensitive fields: employee id, full name, email, department, location, and system roles. Ensure this step does not touch salary or human resources notes. No fuzzy search is needed here because the current user id is bound by the session and should match exactly.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"] }
**Result:** Step 1 completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() and retrieved the current user's core attributes. However, the system_roles field is not available through the current API functions. The WhoAmI object only contains: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, and wiki_sha1. The EmployeeFull object (from get_employee) contains: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, and wills. Neither model includes a system_roles field. I cannot retrieve system_roles with the available functions, so I'm returning an empty array as required by the output schema. All other fields were explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "name": "Laura Pellegrini",
  "email": "ayEi_001@bellini.internal",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read skills and project participation data for all employees, ensuring compliance with company rules before searching for the least skilled person in German language.
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), evaluate authorization rules: confirm that reading cross-employee skills (from employee_skill) and project participation (from team_member and project) is allowed for this user, while explicitly excluding any access to salary or confidential human resources notes from the employee table. Implement this as a policy-engine or rules check based on system_roles (for example, general employees may read shared skill metadata, executives may have broader access). If access is denied, do not proceed further with the task.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "authorized": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["authorized"] }
**Result:** The permission check for Step 2 has been completed. I executed the identity lookup using who_am_i() to verify the current user's authentication status and department. The function returns showed: current user "ayEi_001", department "Corporate Leadership", location "HQ – Italy", and is_public=False (authenticated). 

Based on explicit company rules analysis:
1. Authenticated User Rules state that for EmployeeProfile accessed via chatbot, ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes "context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)"
2. Query types like SearchBySkill are explicitly allowed, returning lists of employees with fields {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} only
3. Project participation data can be accessed through project queries which don't have explicit restrictions for reading team membership
4. The task requires reading skills and project work data only, not salary or confidential HR notes

The verification confirmed all facts from function returns: user is authenticated and in Corporate Leadership department. No assumptions were made about system_roles since they're not available via the API, but the chatbot access rules explicitly permit skill reading for all authenticated users.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "authorized": true,
  "denial_reason": ""
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Identify and confirm the relevant data sources and query interfaces needed to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.
Approach: Inspect the available structured data schema and confirm that: (1) German language skill levels are stored in the employee_skill table using fields employee_id, skill_name, level, and skill_type; (2) project participation for employees is stored in the team_member table using fields employee_id and project_id; and (3) non-sensitive employee details (name, email, location, department) are stored in the employee table, while explicitly avoiding use of the salary and notes fields. Confirm that these tables are accessible via standard Structured Query Language (SQL) or the equivalent data access layer. No fuzzy search is required here because table and column names are exactly defined by the schema.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "skills_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "projects_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["skills_source_confirmed", "projects_source_confirmed", "employee_source_confirmed"] }

I'll execute Step 3 by examining the available data models and functions to confirm we can access the required data sources.

```python
# First, let's get current context

<final_answer>
Based on the examination of available data structures and functions, I have confirmed that all required data sources are accessible through the provided API functions:

1. **German language skill levels**: Accessible via the `skills` and `wills` fields in `EmployeeFull` objects, which contain lists of `SkillLevel` objects with `name` and `level` attributes. The `search_employees()` function also supports filtering by skills with a `skills` parameter that accepts a list of dictionaries with `name` and `min_level`.

2. **Project participation data**: Accessible via multiple sources:
   - `ProjectFull.team` field containing `TeamMember` objects with `employee` (ID), `role`, and `time_slice`
   - `search_projects()` function with `team_employee` parameter to find projects by team member
   - `search_time_entries()` function to track actual hours worked on projects
   - `time_summary_by_employee()` and `time_summary_by_project()` for aggregated project work data

3. **Non-sensitive employee details**: Accessible via `EmployeeBrief` and `EmployeeFull` objects, which include `id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, and `department` fields. The `salary` and `notes` fields are explicitly excluded as per company rules.

All data sources are accessible through the equivalent data access layer (provided API functions) without requiring direct SQL access. The functions support the necessary queries to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Identify and confirm the relevant data sources and query interfaces needed to evaluate German language skill levels and project work for all employees.
Approach: Inspect the available structured data schema and confirm that: (1) German language skill levels are stored in the employee_skill table using fields employee_id, skill_name, level, and skill_type; (2) project participation for employees is stored in the team_member table using fields employee_id and project_id; and (3) non-sensitive employee details (name, email, location, department) are stored in the employee table, while explicitly avoiding use of the salary and notes fields. Confirm that these tables are accessible via standard Structured Query Language (SQL) or the equivalent data access layer. No fuzzy search is required here because table and column names are exactly defined by the schema.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "skills_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "projects_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" }, "employee_source_confirmed": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["skills_source_confirmed", "projects_source_confirmed", "employee_source_confirmed"] }

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 3 according to the instructions and verified all required data sources through actual function calls. The verification confirmed:

1. **German language skill levels**: Confirmed via `EmployeeFull.skills` and `EmployeeFull.wills` fields, which contain `SkillLevel` objects with `name` (string) and `level` (integer) attributes. The sample employee `ayEi_001` has 15 skills and 6 wills, and language-related terms including 'german' and 'english' were found in their skill/will names.

2. **Project participation for employees**: Confirmed via `ProjectFull.team` field, which contains `TeamMember` objects with `employee` (ID string), `time_slice` (float), and `role` (string) attributes. The sample project `proj_ferro_rail_bogie_anticorrosion` has 4 team members, demonstrating the project participation structure.

3. **Non-sensitive employee details**: Confirmed via `EmployeeBrief` and `EmployeeFull` objects, which provide `id`, `name`, `email`, `location`, and `department` fields. The sample employee shows all these non-sensitive fields are accessible, while `salary` and `notes` fields exist but are excluded as per company rules.

All data sources are accessible through the provided API functions, which serve as the equivalent data access layer. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
