I have executed the step instruction fully. I used the search_wiki_fuzzy function with the specified queries ("pause project", "project status paused", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer") and additional related terms. I also used regex search and loaded relevant wiki files to examine content. All facts in the JSON output are derived directly from function returns (printed output). No assumptions were made, and no state-changing functions were called.

Key verified findings from wiki searches:
1. **Definition of "paused"**: Found in business/markets_and_customers.md: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."
2. **Status values**: Found in systems/project_registry.md: valid statuses include `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, `paused`, `archived`.
3. **Process reference**: Found in systems/chatbot_interface.md: chatbot can "Update project team or status." Also in systems/project_registry.md: "Project manager: Keeps the status up to date."
4. **Permissions note**: The wiki mentions actions are performed "depending on permissions" but does not specify exact roles. No detailed step-by-step procedure for pausing beyond updating status was found.

No additional actions or constraints were documented in the wiki beyond updating the project status to "paused".

{
  "guideline_found": true,
  "pause_definition": "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed).",
  "process_reference": "Update project team or status (via chatbot or directly in ProjectRegistry). Project manager is responsible for keeping status up to date."
}
