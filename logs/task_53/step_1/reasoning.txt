We are given: 
- Step 1: Consult internal wiki or company documentation to understand the standard definition and process for "pausing" a project.
- We have functions: list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki (regex), search_wiki_fuzzy (fuzzy search).
- We are to use fuzzy and semantic/logical search. We'll use search_wiki_fuzzy with words like "pause project", "project status paused", and "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer".
- We'll also consider partial matching and semantic search. We might also list wiki pages to see if there is a documentation page.

Approach:
1. First, check if there are any wiki pages that might be about project management or pause.
2. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with the target words.
3. Analyze the results to find guidelines.

Important: We are to output a JSON with:
   - guideline_found: boolean
   - pause_definition: string or null
   - process_reference: string or null

We need to extract from the wiki any clear definition of "pause project" and the process (e.g., which status value, any constraints/roles).

Let's start by listing wiki pages to get an idea of available documentation.

We have found some relevant information in the regex search. Let's examine the lines from the regex search more closely.

From the regex search output:
- In `business/markets_and_customers.md`, line 58: "4. **Paused or archived** - Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed..."
- In `systems/project_registry.md`, line 32: "  - `exploring`  - `active`  - `paused`  - `archived`"

This suggests that "paused" is a valid project status. Let's load the `systems/project_registry.md` file to see the full context and any procedures.

Also, note that the step asks for fuzzy and semantic search. We have already done fuzzy search and found some matches, but the regex search gave more direct hits.

Let's load the two most relevant files: `systems/project_registry.md` and `business/markets_and_customers.md` to extract the relevant sections.

[REASONING #3] 2025-12-09 21:39:24
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are looking for a clear definition of "pause project" and the process for doing it.
 From the search results, we found:
  1. In systems/project_registry.md, the project statuses include `paused` (along with `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, `archived`).
  2. In business/markets_and_customers.md, it says: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."
  3. In systems/chatbot_interface.md, it says the chatbot can perform actions including "Update project team or status."

 However, we don't have a detailed step-by-step process for pausing a project (e.g., who can do it, any prerequisites, etc.).
 Let's look for more specific information about updating project status, especially about permissions.

 We saw in the project registry that the project manager is responsible for keeping the status up to date (line 108: "Keeps the **status** up to date").

 Also, note the company rules in the initial context: 
   "IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
     REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;"

 So, only the project manager, department leaders, project admins, or IT admins can update the project status.

 Let's search for more about permissions or the process of updating project status.

 We'll also check the chatbot interface for more details on updating project status.

We have searched the wiki and found relevant information about pausing a project. Let me summarize the findings:

1. **Definition of "paused"**: From `business/markets_and_customers.md`, we have: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."

2. **Project status values**: From `systems/project_registry.md`, the project status can be one of: `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, `paused`, `archived`.

3. **Process for updating project status**: From `systems/chatbot_interface.md`, we see that the chatbot can perform actions including "Update project team or status." However, we don't have a detailed step-by-step procedure for pausing a project.

4. **Permissions**: We don't have explicit documentation on who is allowed to pause a project. However, from the company rules in the initial context, we know that for actions like `UpdateProjectCoreFields` (which includes status), the requirement is that the user must be the project manager or have certain roles (DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin). We should note that the current user is in the "External" department, which likely doesn't have these permissions.

5. **Additional actions**: We didn't find any documentation about additional steps required when pausing a project (like notifying team members, updating time entries, etc.). The definition simply states it's for "no current activity."

Given the above, the step is to consult the wiki for the definition and process. We have found the definition and know that the status can be set to "paused". However, we did not find a detailed process document. The process is likely to use the `update_project_status` function (which we know exists from the available functions) and set the status to "paused".

We should output the findings in the required JSON format.

Note: The step is only to consult the wiki, not to actually pause the project.

Expected Output: 
{
  "guideline_found": true,
  "pause_definition": "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed).",
  "process_reference": "Update project team or status (via chatbot or directly in ProjectRegistry). Requires project manager or authorized role (DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin)."
}

However, we must base the output only on what we found in the wiki. We found the definition and a reference to updating project status in the chatbot interface, but not a detailed process. We can note that the process is to update the project status to "paused" and that it requires permissions.

Let me check if there's any more specific process in the wiki by searching for "update project status" in the chatbot interface again, but with a different approach.

I'll load the chatbot interface file and look for the line about updating project status.

We need to verify that we have indeed executed the step correctly and that all facts are from function returns.

We used:
- list_wiki() to get available wiki pages.
- search_wiki_fuzzy() with multiple terms.
- search_wiki() with regex for "pause".
- load_wiki() on specific files to examine content.

We found explicit definitions:
- From business/markets_and_customers.md: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."
- From systems/project_registry.md: Status values include `paused`.
- From systems/chatbot_interface.md: The chatbot can "Update project team or status."

We did not find a detailed step-by-step procedure, but we did find that updating status is an action the chatbot can perform, and we have the definition of paused.

We also noted from the initial company rules that updating project status requires the user to be the project manager or have certain roles. However, that is from the initial context, not from the wiki. The step asked to consult internal wiki or company documentation. The initial context includes company rules, but the step specifically says "Consult internal wiki or company documentation". The company rules were provided as part of the system context, but we did not search for them in the wiki. We should check if there are any documented permissions in the wiki.

Let's quickly search for permissions related to project status updates in the wiki.

```python
# Quick search for permissions in wiki
permission_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(["permission to update project status", "who can update project status", "project manager update status"], top_n=5, context_chars=200)
if permission_results:
    print("Search results for permissions:")
    for r in permission_results:
        print(f"File: {r['path']}, Match: {r['matched']}, Ratio: {r['ratio']:.2f}")
        print(f"Context: {r['context']}")
else:
    print("No direct permission documentation found in wiki via fuzzy search.")

# Also check the project registry file for any permission notes
project_reg_content = load_wiki("systems/project_registry.md")
if project_reg_content and "permission" in project_reg_content.lower():
    lines = project_reg_content.split('\n')
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if "permission" in line.lower():
            print(f"\nPermission mention in systems/project_registry.md line {i+1}: {line}")
else:
    print("\nNo explicit permission notes in project_registry.md (from quick check).")
```

The user wants me to confirm whether I executed the step instruction correctly, and to ensure all facts are verified from function returns, not assumed. I need to re-examine my search process and ensure I've covered all aspects of the step description.

Step 1 asks to consult internal wiki using fuzzy and semantic/logical search with queries like "pause project", "project status paused", and "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer". I did use search_wiki_fuzzy with those terms. I also used regex search. I found relevant information in wiki pages.

I need to verify that I have explicitly printed/verified all facts from function returns. Let me review what I printed:

1. I listed available wiki pages.
2. I performed fuzzy searches for each term and printed top results.
3. I performed regex search for "pause" and printed results.
4. I loaded specific files (project_registry.md, markets_and_customers.md, chatbot_interface.md) and printed relevant sections.
5. I searched for lifecycle documentation.
6. I searched for permissions and constraints.

I found:
- Definition of "paused" in business/markets_and_customers.md: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."
- Project status values in systems/project_registry.md: `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, `paused`, `archived`.
- Process reference: chatbot can "Update project team or status." (from systems/chatbot_interface.md)
- Responsibilities: Project manager keeps status up to date (from systems/project_registry.md).
- Permissions: In the initial company rules (provided in context), it's stated that for actions like updating project status, the user must be project manager or have certain roles. However, this is from the initial context, not from wiki search. The step asks to capture any constraints or required roles mentioned in the wiki. I need to see if the wiki mentions roles for updating project status.

From my last search, I see in systems/chatbot_interface.md: "Perform selected actions (depending on permissions): - Update project team or status." This indicates permissions are required, but does not specify which roles. I also saw in systems/project_registry.md: "Project manager: Keeps the status up to date." That implies the project manager is responsible, but not necessarily that only they can do it.

I should also check if there are any additional actions when pausing a project (like notifying team, updating time entries, etc.). I didn't find any such procedure in the wiki.

Thus, my JSON output should reflect exactly what I found: guideline_found = true, pause_definition from the markets_and_customers.md, process_reference from chatbot_interface.md and project_registry.md.

I should ensure that process_reference is a string derived from the wiki, not from the initial context rules. I'll combine the relevant parts.

Let me craft the JSON based on verified findings:

- guideline_found: true (because I found documentation)
- pause_definition: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)." (direct quote from markets_and_customers.md)
- process_reference: "Update project team or status (via chatbot or directly in ProjectRegistry). Project manager is responsible for keeping status up to date." (derived from chatbot_interface.md and project_registry.md)

I should also note that no detailed step-by-step procedure or specific role constraints beyond "depending on permissions" and project manager responsibility were found.

Thus, I will output the same JSON as before, but ensure it's based solely on printed wiki content.

I did not change any state (no update functions called), so no state changes to report.

I will now provide the final answer and JSON.
