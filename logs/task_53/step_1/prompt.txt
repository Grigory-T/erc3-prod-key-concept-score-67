Step 1: Consult internal wiki or company documentation to understand the standard definition and process for "pausing" a project (for example, whether it corresponds to setting project.status to "paused" or involves additional actions), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle possible ambiguity in the term "pause project" and any company-specific terminology.
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) with queries such as "pause project", "project status paused", and "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer". Apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic / logical search to account for typos, alternate phrasing, and internal slang. From the top results, identify any documented procedure that clearly maps "pause project" to a system-level action (such as updating the project.status field in the ProjectRegistry or similar) and capture any constraints or required roles mentioned.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"guideline_found":{"type":"boolean"},"pause_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"process_reference":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["guideline_found","pause_definition","process_reference"]}
