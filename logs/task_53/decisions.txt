DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:42:19
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully and returned relevant, correct results matching the expected output in the plan. All findings align with the planned process, and there are no inconsistencies or missing information. There is no indication the subsequent steps need modification. The next step should be attempted as per the original plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:46:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have returned expected, relevant, and correct results according to the plan. There are no inconsistencies or unexpected system limitations. The plan strictly matches company policies and the original task's goal. Therefore, the next step (Step 3) should be executed as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:48:14
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have succeeded and provided results aligned with the expected outputs and plan wording. The next planned step (Step 4: permissions check) is fully feasible and required to advance the task. There are no obstacles, missing information, inconsistencies, or need for replanning. Therefore, per plan, the correct decision is to continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:53:12
Decision: replan_remaining

Reasoning:
The original plan specifies that authorization for updating project status must be determined strictly by checking if the current user is the project manager or possesses certain system roles (DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin), and that roles must be derived from system data and not inferred. In Step 4, it was found that the current user (Bhwa_154) is NOT the project manager, and crucially, the system_roles for the user cannot be retrieved due to limitations in the available functions and data sources. Therefore, we cannot proceed to Step 5 (executing the status update) because there is not enough information to confirm authorization as required by the company rules and the plan. Step 5 expects to skip the write if has_permission is false, but since the plan’s rules have now diverged from the real data environment (missing critical system_roles data), further steps would be blocked or misleading. This situation—where requirements for a decision cannot be satisfied for technical/organizational reasons—requires replanning, NOT aborting, because the inability to retrieve system_roles is context-specific and could be handled with an adjusted approach (for example, by escalating or explicitly flagging the missing data).
