Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the identifier "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer" in the identified project storage (for example, the project table), using exact match first and then FUZZY, partial, and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on identifiers and names to account for possible typos or naming variations, and list all candidate matches if ambiguous.
Approach: Query the project storage (for example, via SQL SELECT on the project table) first by exact id: WHERE id = 'proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer'. If no row is found, relax the search by checking for rows where LOWER(id) contains a normalized substring of 'proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer', then by fuzzy matching on id and name fields (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to catch minor misspellings, and, if available, semantic / logical search to match similar project names. If multiple rows match above a confidence threshold, treat the result as ambiguous and return all relevant candidates; if exactly one high-confidence match exists, return that as the target project; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_type":{"type":"string"},"project":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["found","match_type","project","candidates"]}
