I have successfully completed Step 3: locating the specific project record for "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer". I followed the exact approach outlined in the step description: first attempting an exact match by ID, which was successful. Since the exact match was found, there was no need to proceed to fuzzy, partial, or semantic/logical searches. All facts in the JSON output are directly derived from the function return values, which were explicitly printed and verified. No state-changing functions were called, and no assumptions were made.

The project was found with the following verified details:
- ID: proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer (exact match)
- Name: Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line
- Customer ID: cust_balkanmetal_fabrication
- Status: exploring
