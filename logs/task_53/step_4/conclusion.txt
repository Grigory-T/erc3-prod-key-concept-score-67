I have executed Step 4 to check the current user identity and permissions for updating core project fields (specifically Status) for project "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer". 

The verification revealed a critical issue: while I successfully retrieved the current user identity and determined the project manager, I could not access the user's `system_roles` data as required by the step instructions. Despite extensive searching through available functions and wiki documentation, the `system_roles` field is not exposed through any available API functions (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`, etc.).

Key verified findings:
1. Current user: Bhwa_154 (Massimo Giuliani), department: External
2. Project manager: Bhwa_010 (identified as team member with role 'Lead')
3. User is NOT the project manager (Bhwa_154 ≠ Bhwa_010)
4. System_roles cannot be retrieved: No function returns this data, and employee notes are empty

Without access to `system_roles`, I cannot verify if the user has DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin roles as required by company authorization rules. The step explicitly states: "Do not infer roles; rely on stored system_roles and project data."

Therefore, based solely on verifiable data:
- User is not the project manager (verified)
- System_roles cannot be retrieved to check for required roles (verified)

This results in insufficient information to grant permission according to the authorization rule.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_154",
  "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
  "has_permission": false,
  "denial_reason": "User is not project manager and system_roles could not be retrieved to verify required roles (DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin)"
}
