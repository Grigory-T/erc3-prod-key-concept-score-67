## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-04-25
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_154
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_154", "name": "Massimo Giuliani", "department": "External", "location": "HQ - Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Pause project: proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Consult internal wiki or company documentation to understand the standard definition and process for "pausing" a project (for example, whether it corresponds to setting project.status to "paused" or involves additional actions), using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle possible ambiguity in the term "pause project" and any company-specific terminology.
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) with queries such as "pause project", "project status paused", and "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer". Apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic / logical search to account for typos, alternate phrasing, and internal slang. From the top results, identify any documented procedure that clearly maps "pause project" to a system-level action (such as updating the project.status field in the ProjectRegistry or similar) and capture any constraints or required roles mentioned.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"guideline_found":{"type":"boolean"},"pause_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"process_reference":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["guideline_found","pause_definition","process_reference"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction fully. I used the search_wiki_fuzzy function with the specified queries ("pause project", "project status paused", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer") and additional related terms. I also used regex search and loaded relevant wiki files to examine content. All facts in the JSON output are derived directly from function returns (printed output). No assumptions were made, and no state-changing functions were called.

Key verified findings from wiki searches:
1. **Definition of "paused"**: Found in business/markets_and_customers.md: "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed)."
2. **Status values**: Found in systems/project_registry.md: valid statuses include `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, `paused`, `archived`.
3. **Process reference**: Found in systems/chatbot_interface.md: chatbot can "Update project team or status." Also in systems/project_registry.md: "Project manager: Keeps the status up to date."
4. **Permissions note**: The wiki mentions actions are performed "depending on permissions" but does not specify exact roles. No detailed step-by-step procedure for pausing beyond updating status was found.

No additional actions or constraints were documented in the wiki beyond updating the project status to "paused".

{
  "guideline_found": true,
  "pause_definition": "Projects may be `paused` (no current activity) or `archived` (closed).",
  "process_reference": "Update project team or status (via chatbot or directly in ProjectRegistry). Project manager is responsible for keeping status up to date."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (for example, ProjectRegistry, database tables, or APIs) used to store and update project records, focusing on how project status is persisted and can be changed, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for system names and interfaces.
Approach: Search internal technical documentation, system catalogs, or architecture wiki (for example, via search_wiki_fuzzy or similar tools) for terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", and "update project". Use fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching to tolerate misspellings and variations (for example, "projects", "proj registry"). From the findings, determine which backend system and interface (for example, direct SQL on the project table as defined in the SQL schema, or a dedicated UpdateProjectStatus API) is the authoritative way to update the status field of a project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_system":{"type":["string","null"]},"update_capability":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["implementation_found","storage_system","update_capability"]}

I'll search the wiki for technical implementation details about project storage and status updates.

# Project Registry

The **project registry** is the central place where Bellini tracks all significant **customer and internal work** as projects.

## What is a project?

A project is any substantial piece of work that:

- Requires coordinated effort across multiple people or departments, and/or
- Represents a distinct opportunity, development or contract.

Examples:

- Developing a new high‑temperature coating for a machinery OEM.
- Implementing a new floor coating system at a large warehouse.
- Internal R&D initiatives (e.g. new low‑VOC formulation series).
- Internal process or IT projects (e.g. chatbot pilot, warehouse re‑layout).
- Departmental initiatives (e.g. “HR – Training 2025”).

## Core project fields

Each project has:

- Project ID (internal)
- Name
- Linked customer (if applicable)
- Description / brief
- Status (aligned with deal phases):
  - `idea`
  - `exploring`
  - `active`
  - `paused`
  - `archived`
- Project manager (employee ID)
- Team and workloads:
  - Which employees are assigned
  - Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)
  - Their approximate time slice (fraction of an FTE)

## Why the project registry matters

- **Planning and workload**
  - Managers can see who is involved in which projects and at what intensity.
- **Visibility**
  - Sales, R&D, production and management can all see key projects and their status.
- **Reporting**
  - Combined with time tracking, the registry supports cost and effort analysis by project and customer.

## Project types

While the system uses a single “project” concept, we distinguish informally between:

- **Customer development projects**
  - New or adapted formulations, trials and approvals.
- **Customer supply projects**
  - Ongoing contracts where time is logged for support and technical visits.
- **Internal R&D projects**
  - Platform developments, testing programmes, regulatory updates.
- **Internal process / IT projects**
  - Improvements in production, logistics, quality, HR, IT and

digitalisation.

## Workload

Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:

* `Employee` – the employee ID
* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)
* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)

These allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.

### How total workload is computed

1. **Collect all projects** where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects unless explicitly included in reporting.
   Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload.

2. **Extract each `TimeSlice` value** for the employee from every such project.
   For example, if an employee is allocated:

  * 0.5 FTE in Project A
  * 0.3 FTE in Project B
  * 0.2 FTE in Project C

   then their planned workload totals **1.0 FTE**.

3. **Sum all FTE slices** to determine the employee’s **aggregate planned workload**.
   This provides a quick view of whether someone is under-allocated, fully allocated, or overloaded.

4. **Compare allocations to actual time spent** (from time tracking) when needed.
   The time tracking system records real hours spent on each project and customer, which can be aggregated by employee. This allows managers to reconcile planned vs. actual workload.

### Why this method is used

* It aligns with the project-centric way Bellini plans work: projects define who is involved and at what intensity.
* It provides a **forward-looking view** of workload independent of time logs, which reflect past activity.
* It supports cross-department planning, since employees often contr

# Systems Overview

Bellini Coatings runs its core business on a set of **legacy but robust systems** built on **Progress OpenEdge** more than 30 years ago. These systems are centralised at HQ and accessed from Italy, Serbia and all EU branches.

The main systems visible to most employees are:

- **CRM – Customer Relationship Management**
- **Project Registry**
- **Employee Registry (including skills & wills)**
- **Time Tracking / Timesheets**
- **Knowledge Base / Wiki**
- **Chatbot Interface (new layer over existing systems)**

## Design principles

1. **Single source of truth**
   - Each type of information has a “home” system (e.g. customer data in CRM, people data in employee registry).
2. **Stability over novelty**
   - The core systems are old but extremely stable. We minimise risky changes.
3. **Progressive modernisation**
   - New initiatives (like the chatbot) sit **on top of** existing systems rather than replacing them immediately.

## System roles and access

Every employee with system access has:

- A **user account** mapped to an internal employee ID.
- A **location** and **department** associated with their profile.
- One or more **system roles** (e.g. “SalesUser”, “R&DUser”, “HRAdmin”, “ITAdmin”).

Access is granted according to job needs and is centrally managed by IT in coordination with HR and managers.

## Relationship between systems

At a high level:

- The **CRM** stores customers and basic opportunities.
- The **project registry** tracks all major cust

Based on my comprehensive search of the company wiki and technical documentation, I have identified the concrete technical implementation for storing and updating project records.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed the step by searching internal technical documentation using fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching. I examined multiple wiki files including systems/project_registry.md, systems/overview.md, systems/chatbot_interface.md, and company/history.md. The search covered terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", "update project", "backend system", and "API update". The key findings are:

1. **Implementation Found**: Yes, the technical implementation is clearly documented.

2. **Storage System**: The authoritative storage for project records is the **Project Registry**, which is built on the **Progress OpenEdge** database platform. This is a legacy but robust system implemented in the early 1990s and remains the central system of record for all project data. The Project Registry stores project fields including ID, name, description, status, linked customer, project manager, and team workloads.

3. **Update Capability**: Project status updates are performed through **APIs** that the chatbot interface uses to interact with the Project Registry. Specifically, the chatbot can "Update project team or status" via these APIs. The systems/overview.md confirms: "The chatbot reads from and writes to these systems via APIs." There is no mention of direct SQL access or database table manipulation; all updates go through the authorized interfaces (chatbot APIs) that respect the company's permission rules.

The implementation follows the company's design principle of having a "single source of truth" where the Project Registry is the home system for project data, and updates are made through controlled interfaces that enforce business rules and permissions.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (for example, ProjectRegistry, database tables, or APIs) used to store and update project records, focusing on how project status is persisted and can be changed, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for system names and interfaces.
Approach: Search internal technical documentation, system catalogs, or architecture wiki (for example, via search_wiki_fuzzy or similar tools) for terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", and "update project". Use fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching to tolerate misspellings and variations (for example, "projects", "proj registry"). From the findings, determine which backend system and interface (for example, direct SQL on the project table as defined in the SQL schema, or a dedicated UpdateProjectStatus API) is the authoritative way to update the status field of a project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_system":{"type":["string","null"]},"update_capability":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["implementation_found","storage_system","update_capability"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have executed the step instruction fully, conducting comprehensive searches of the internal wiki using fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching. I verified all facts from function returns without making assumptions or using made-up data. The searches covered terms including "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", "update project", and variations. The key verified findings are:

1. **Storage System**: The Project Registry is the authoritative storage system for project records. It is built on the **Progress OpenEdge** database platform, as explicitly stated in multiple wiki files (company/history.md, systems/overview.md).

2. **Update Capability**: Project status updates are performed through **APIs** that the chatbot interface uses. The chatbot can "Update project team or status" (systems/chatbot_interface.md), and the systems/overview.md confirms the chatbot reads from and writes to these systems via APIs.

No explicit database table names or direct SQL access methods were found in the wiki. The documented method for updating project status is through the chatbot interface using APIs that interact with the Project Registry system.

All information in the JSON output is derived from explicitly printed function returns during the search.
