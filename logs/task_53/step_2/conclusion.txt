I have executed the step instruction fully, conducting comprehensive searches of the internal wiki using fuzzy, semantic, and logical matching. I verified all facts from function returns without making assumptions or using made-up data. The searches covered terms including "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", "update project", and variations. The key verified findings are:

1. **Storage System**: The Project Registry is the authoritative storage system for project records. It is built on the **Progress OpenEdge** database platform, as explicitly stated in multiple wiki files (company/history.md, systems/overview.md).

2. **Update Capability**: Project status updates are performed through **APIs** that the chatbot interface uses. The chatbot can "Update project team or status" (systems/chatbot_interface.md), and the systems/overview.md confirms the chatbot reads from and writes to these systems via APIs.

No explicit database table names or direct SQL access methods were found in the wiki. The documented method for updating project status is through the chatbot interface using APIs that interact with the Project Registry system.

All information in the JSON output is derived from explicitly printed function returns during the search.
