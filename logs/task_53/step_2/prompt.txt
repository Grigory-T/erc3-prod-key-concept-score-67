Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (for example, ProjectRegistry, database tables, or APIs) used to store and update project records, focusing on how project status is persisted and can be changed, using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for system names and interfaces.
Approach: Search internal technical documentation, system catalogs, or architecture wiki (for example, via search_wiki_fuzzy or similar tools) for terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project table", "project.status", and "update project". Use fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching to tolerate misspellings and variations (for example, "projects", "proj registry"). From the findings, determine which backend system and interface (for example, direct SQL on the project table as defined in the SQL schema, or a dedicated UpdateProjectStatus API) is the authoritative way to update the status field of a project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_system":{"type":["string","null"]},"update_capability":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["implementation_found","storage_system","update_capability"]}
