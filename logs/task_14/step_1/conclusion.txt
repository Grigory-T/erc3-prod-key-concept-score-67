Based on the search of internal documentation and wiki files, I have determined the canonical name for the will/skill "Interest in cross-site collaboration". The search found an exact match in the company's example employee profiles documentation, confirming it is an officially defined will in the company model.

{
  "found": true,
  "normalized_skill_name": "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)",
  "documentation_source": "hr/example_employee_profiles.md",
  "notes": "This term appears to be a 'will' (motivation/interest) rather than a 'skill' (capability) in the company's skills & wills model. It is documented in employee profiles with a level rating on a 1-10 scale. The specific example includes location details '(Italy/Serbia)' which may be part of the canonical name or an example-specific annotation."
}
