Step 1: Clarify what the will/skill "Interest in cross-site collaboration" means and whether it is an officially defined competency or will in the company model.
Approach: Search internal documentation and wiki files (wiki_file table and any related documentation systems) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like "Interest in cross-site collaboration", "cross site collaboration", "cross-site", and related competency or will names. Account for possible misspellings, different hyphenation, or wording (for example, "cross location collaboration" or "collaboration across sites"). From the best match, determine the canonical or normalized skill/will name that should be used when querying structured data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"normalized_skill_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"documentation_source":{"type":["string","null"]},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["found","normalized_skill_name"]}
