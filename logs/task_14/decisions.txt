DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:43:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is proceeding according to the defined steps. Step 1 is complete and has produced the expected result: the canonical will name 'Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)' has been identified and confirmed as a valid 'will' in the company model. There are no deviations, errors, or unexpected results. The next appropriate step is Step 2, which involves identifying the technical data source and exact fields that store employee wills. There is no reason to replan, abort, or provide a final answer at this stage.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:53:05
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The first two steps in the original plan have been fully completed with clear, expected, and relevant results. There are no discrepancies or missing functions: the will's canonical name is clarified, and its presence and storage are confirmed in the employee_registry system. The next step is to verify the current user's identity and permissions to ensure a policy-compliant SearchBySkill query is allowed, as originally planned. No unexpected issues have been encountered that would require replanning.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:57:00
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced expected results strictly following the Original Plan. There are no discrepancies, errors, or authorization issues. The technical data source has been clarified and company policy allows the requested queries. The next step (Step 4) can proceed as planned to retrieve employees with the relevant will and their levels.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:15:15
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps up to Step 4 have produced correct and expected results, according to the plan. The input required for Step 5 (the list of employees and their will levels) is present and correct. There are no inconsistencies or missing data. The next step is to apply a simple computation on this data to determine which employee(s) have the highest will_level for 'Interest in cross-site collaboration'. Therefore, the plan remains valid and the task can proceed directly to the final computation step as described.
