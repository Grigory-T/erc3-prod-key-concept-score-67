Step 3: Verify the current user's identity and permissions to search employee wills by skill within company policy constraints.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent EmployeeRegistry lookup for user id "iv5n_001" to retrieve department, location, and system_roles. Then, using **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** evaluation of authorization rules, confirm that performing a SearchBySkill-type query on employee wills (returning only allowed public fields such as name, email, location, department, and relevant skill/will levels) is permitted. Do not proceed with any data access if the check fails.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"search_by_skill_allowed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","search_by_skill_allowed"]}
