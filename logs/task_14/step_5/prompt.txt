Step 5: Determine which employee or employees are most eager to get better at "Interest in cross-site collaboration" based on will levels and present the result.
Approach: From the list of employees and will levels obtained in Step 4, compute the maximum will_level value. Select all employees whose will_level equals this maximum, as they are the most eager to get better at this will. If no employees are found, the result set is empty. Prepare the final output as a list of these top employees, including only allowed fields (employee_id, name, email, location, department, and will_level), and ensure that if multiple employees share the same highest will_level they are all included. This step uses **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** reasoning only on already-fetched data and does not perform new external searches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"normalized_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"max_will_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"most_eager_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]},"will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","will_level"]}}},"required":["normalized_skill_name","most_eager_employees"]}
