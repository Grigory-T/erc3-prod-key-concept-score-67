Based on comprehensive analysis of the company's documentation and actual employee data, I have identified the technical data source and fields for storing employee wills. The investigation revealed:

1. Extensive search of technical documentation found no mention of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field.
2. The employee registry (Progress OpenEdge system) stores employee data including separate skills and wills arrays.
3. Actual employee data examination shows wills are stored with "will_" prefix (e.g., "will_cross_site").
4. Both skills and wills use SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields.
5. The normalized name "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)" is confirmed as a will based on documentation and naming convention.

{
  "table_name": "employee_registry",
  "skill_name_field": "name",
  "level_field": "level",
  "skill_type_field": "",
  "normalized_skill_name": "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)",
  "confirmed_is_will": true
}
