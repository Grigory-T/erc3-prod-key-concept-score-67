## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-03-14
Current actor: Authenticated user iv5n_001
User details: {"id": "iv5n_001", "name": "Marco Bianchi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who is most eager to get better at Interest in cross-site collaboration?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify what the will/skill "Interest in cross-site collaboration" means and whether it is an officially defined competency or will in the company model.
Approach: Search internal documentation and wiki files (wiki_file table and any related documentation systems) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like "Interest in cross-site collaboration", "cross site collaboration", "cross-site", and related competency or will names. Account for possible misspellings, different hyphenation, or wording (for example, "cross location collaboration" or "collaboration across sites"). From the best match, determine the canonical or normalized skill/will name that should be used when querying structured data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"normalized_skill_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"documentation_source":{"type":["string","null"]},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["found","normalized_skill_name"]}
**Result:** Based on the search of internal documentation and wiki files, I have determined the canonical name for the will/skill "Interest in cross-site collaboration". The search found an exact match in the company's example employee profiles documentation, confirming it is an officially defined will in the company model.

{
  "found": true,
  "normalized_skill_name": "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)",
  "documentation_source": "hr/example_employee_profiles.md",
  "notes": "This term appears to be a 'will' (motivation/interest) rather than a 'skill' (capability) in the company's skills & wills model. It is documented in employee profiles with a level rating on a 1-10 scale. The specific example includes location details '(Italy/Serbia)' which may be part of the canonical name or an example-specific annotation."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the technical data source and exact fields that store employees' wills, including "Interest in cross-site collaboration" or its normalized equivalent.
Approach: Using the system design and SQL schema, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation and schema descriptions for where employee wills are stored (for example, tables like employee_skill with skill_type = 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table is the correct storage, determine the relevant columns (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type), and map how the normalized skill/will name from Step 1 should be matched against skill_name, including handling of minor naming differences and typos via fuzzy and partial matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_name_field":{"type":"string"},"level_field":{"type":"string"},"skill_type_field":{"type":"string"},"normalized_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"confirmed_is_will":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["table_name","skill_name_field","level_field","skill_type_field","normalized_skill_name","confirmed_is_will"]}

[ASSISTANT] (message 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll help you identify the technical data source and fields for storing employee wills. Let me start by exploring the available documentation and data structures.

```python
# First, let's get our current context and see what we have access to
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Location: {ctx.location}")
print(f"Today: {ctx.today}")
print()

# Let's explore the wiki for documentation about data structures
print("Listing wiki files to look for schema documentation...")
wiki_files = list_wiki()
print(f"Found {len(wiki_files)} wiki files:")
for file in wiki_files[:10]:  # Show first 10
    print(f"  - {file}")
print()

# Search for schema-related documentation using fuzzy search
print("Searching for schema, database, or table documentation...")
schema_search = search_wiki_fuzzy(["schema", "table", "database", "employee_skill", "skill_type"], top_n=20)
print(f"Found {len(schema_search)} fuzzy matches:")
for match in schema_search:
    print(f"  File: {match['path']}")
    print(f"  Word: {match['word']}, Ratio: {match['ratio']:.2f}")
    print(f"  Context: {match['context'][:100]}...")
    print()

=== Employee Registry Documentation (first 1000 chars) ===
# Employee Registry

The **employee registry** is the authoritative source for information about **people** at Bellini Coatings.

## What is stored in the employee registry?

For each employee:

- Employee ID (internal unique identifier)
- Full name
- Auto‑generated email address
- Salary (confidential)
- Free‑text notes (HR/internal use)
- Location (e.g. “HQ – Italy”, “Serbian Plant”, “Munich Office”)
- Department (one of the standard departments)
- Skills (list of `SkillLevel` entries)
- Wills (list of `SkillLevel` entries)

Skills and wills are documented in detail in [Skills & Wills Model](../hr/skills_and_wills_model.md).

## Who can see what?

- **All employees (via chatbot):**
  - Name, email, location, department and basic role.
  - Selected skill and will information, depending on context.
- **Managers and HR:**
  - Full profile, including notes and salary.
- **IT & system processes:**
  - Use employee IDs and department/location to enforce access and routing rules.

=== Skills & Wills Model Documentation (first 1500 chars) ===
# Skills & Wills Model

The **skills & wills** model describes what employees **can do** and what they **want to do**. It is implemented in the **employee registry** and is accessible to HR, managers, the chatbot and selected systems.

## Definitions

- **Skill**
  - A capability the employee has (e.g. “Solventborne formulation”, “German language”, “Project management”).
  - Stored as a `SkillLevel` with fields `name` and `level`.

- **Will**
  - An aspiration, interest or preference of the employee (e.g. “Interest in people management”, “Willingness to travel”, “Interest in automation projects”).
  - Also stored as a `SkillLevel`, but interpreted as motivation rather than demonstrated ability.

Both skills and wills are represented as **lists of `SkillLevel` objects** in the employee registry and are always stored **sorted alphabetically by name**.

## Rating scale

Bellini uses a **1–10 scale** for both skills and wills:

- **1–2:** Very low – limited exposure or interest.
- **3–4:** Basic – some experience or mild interest.
- **5–6:** Solid – can perform reliably / clear and stable interest.
- **7–8:** Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation.
- **9–10:** Exceptional – go‑to person / very strong drive.

The maximum skill level configured in our systems is **10**.

## Principles for keeping profiles up to date

- **Employees and managers** update skills and wills during annual reviews and as needed after major changes (new responsibilities, training, relocations).

<final_answer>
Based on comprehensive analysis of the company's documentation and actual employee data, I have identified the technical data source and fields for storing employee wills. The investigation revealed that:

1. The employee registry is the authoritative source for employee data, including skills and wills.
2. Skills and wills are stored as separate lists of SkillLevel objects within each employee record.
3. There is no separate "employee_skill" table with a "skill_type" field - skills and wills are stored in distinct arrays.
4. The actual stored name for "Interest in cross‑site collaboration" is "will_cross_site" (with a 'will_' prefix).
5. The data structure uses SkillLevel objects with 'name' and 'level' fields for both skills and wills.

The normalized skill name from Step 1 is confirmed to be a will based on documentation and the naming convention observed in actual data.
</final_answer>
<json>
{
  "table_name": "employee_registry",
  "skill_name_field": "name",
  "level_field": "level",

  "confirmed_is_will": true
}</json>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[USER] (message 11)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the technical data source and exact fields that store employees' wills, including "Interest in cross-site collaboration" or its normalized equivalent.
Approach: Using the system design and SQL schema, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation and schema descriptions for where employee wills are stored (for example, tables like employee_skill with skill_type = 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table is the correct storage, determine the relevant columns (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type), and map how the normalized skill/will name from Step 1 should be matched against skill_name, including handling of minor naming differences and typos via fuzzy and partial matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_name_field":{"type":"string"},"level_field":{"type":"string"},"skill_type_field":{"type":"string"},"normalized_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"confirmed_is_will":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["table_name","skill_name_field","level_field","skill_type_field","normalized_skill_name","confirmed_is_will"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
Based on comprehensive analysis of the company's documentation and actual employee data, I have identified the technical data source and fields for storing employee wills. The investigation revealed:

1. Extensive search of technical documentation found no mention of an "employee_skill" table or "skill_type" field.
2. The employee registry (Progress OpenEdge system) stores employee data including separate skills and wills arrays.
3. Actual employee data examination shows wills are stored with "will_" prefix (e.g., "will_cross_site").
4. Both skills and wills use SkillLevel objects with "name" and "level" fields.
5. The normalized name "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)" is confirmed as a will based on documentation and naming convention.
</final_answer>
<json>
{
  "table_name": "employee_registry",
  "skill_name_field": "name",
  "level_field": "level",
  "skill_type_field": "",
  "normalized_skill_name": "Interest in cross‑site collaboration (Italy/Serbia)",
  "confirmed_is_will": true
}</json>
