Step 2: Identify the technical data source and exact fields that store employees' wills, including "Interest in cross-site collaboration" or its normalized equivalent.
Approach: Using the system design and SQL schema, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation and schema descriptions for where employee wills are stored (for example, tables like employee_skill with skill_type = 'will'). Confirm that the employee_skill table is the correct storage, determine the relevant columns (employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type), and map how the normalized skill/will name from Step 1 should be matched against skill_name, including handling of minor naming differences and typos via fuzzy and partial matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_name_field":{"type":"string"},"level_field":{"type":"string"},"skill_type_field":{"type":"string"},"normalized_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"confirmed_is_will":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["table_name","skill_name_field","level_field","skill_type_field","normalized_skill_name","confirmed_is_will"]}
