I have successfully completed Step 1 of the task. I confirmed the current user is Manuela Valli (ID: BwFV_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy. I executed a comprehensive search of the internal wiki using multiple strategies as required:

1. **User Identity Verification**: Confirmed via who_am_i() that the authenticated user is Manuela Valli (BwFV_001).

2. **Multiple Search Strategies Applied**:
   - Listed all 19 wiki files to understand the documentation landscape
   - Performed exact and partial path matching (found 3 relevant files)
   - Conducted regex searches on content (found matches for "deal.?phase" and "exploring.*active")
   - Used fuzzy search (returned 420 matches across all wiki content)
   - Searched for specific phase terms (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived)
   - Loaded and analyzed content from all promising files

3. **Results Verified**: 
   - Found 8 relevant wiki entries with calculated relevance scores
   - Verified that `systems/crm.md` is the main guideline document (score: 0.9)
   - Confirmed the CRM file contains multiple references to "deal phase" and all five phase terms (idea: 1 occurrence, exploring: 1, active: 3, paused: 1, archived: 1)
   - Extracted relevant excerpts focusing on deal phase definitions and transitions

4. **No State Changes**: Only read operations were performed (list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki, search_wiki_fuzzy). No update functions were called, so no system state was altered.

The search successfully identified documentation about CRM deal phases, including the definitions of 'idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', and 'archived', and found content about transitions between phases, particularly from 'exploring' to 'active'.
