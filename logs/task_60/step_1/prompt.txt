Step 1: Search internal wiki and company documentation for how CRM deal phases work, with special focus on definitions of 'idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', and 'archived', and any explicit rule for when a customer moves from 'exploring' to 'active'. Treat terms like 'CRM', 'deal phases', and file names as potentially ambiguous or misspelled, and therefore use **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** search, including partial and approximate matches on wiki_file.path and relevant content.
Approach: Use a who_am_i or equivalent to confirm current user identity is Manuela Valli (id: BwFV_001) only for contextual awareness, then query the wiki storage (wiki_file table) using multiple search strategies to find relevant documentation. Start with exact and partial matches on wiki_file.path and content for strings like 'deal_phase', 'deal phases', 'CRM workflow', 'sales stages', 'customer lifecycle', and 'exploring to active'. If no strong exact matches are found, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_find_in_text, fuzzy_compare) and semantic / logical search over titles and content to capture synonyms (such as 'sales pipeline', 'customer stage', 'account phase') and to handle typos or variations (for example, 'deals phases', 'crmphase', 'deal lifecycle'). Collect all wiki entries that appear relevant to CRM deal phases and store their paths and key excerpts that describe how phases work and transitions between them. Ensure searching accounts for possible mistakes in file names or headings by using partial and fuzzy matching on the path and content fields.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}},"main_guideline_path":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["matches","main_guideline_path"]}
