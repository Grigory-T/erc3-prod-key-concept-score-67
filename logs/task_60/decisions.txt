DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:59:19
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The first step was fully completed as planned: the wiki and internal documentation were thoroughly searched for information about CRM deal phases and transitions, and the main guideline was identified. No unexpected results occurred, no errors or missing data, and all outputs matched the plan. There are no obstacles or compliance issues in proceeding. According to the original plan, the next step is to investigate the technical implementation, which still fits the sequence and dependencies. No replanning or abortion is necessary.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:06:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both steps 1 and 2 were completed successfully and produced the expected output formats exactly as per the original plan. The information gathered is comprehensive, factual, and directly relevant to the next required actions. There were no discrepancies, missing information, or unanticipated issues. The next step (Step 3) is clearly achievable and necessary to confirm permission before moving on to drafting and writing the wiki content. No replan or abort is required; continue as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:09:22
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Task progress is as planned. Steps 1–3 have produced relevant and correct results—even though system_roles and explicit permission checks are unavailable, nothing so far indicates that wiki write is actually denied, and can_write_wiki returned true. No evidence has emerged that would require immediate replanning, as the remaining steps (drafting the markdown and writing to wiki) are still theoretically possible and aligned with available information. The missing system_roles does not prevent the outlined drafting and writing steps. Thus, the plan should proceed as intended according to the original step logic.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:14:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have executed as originally planned and produced their expected outputs. Steps 1–4 were fully completed with all necessary verifications and real system data, and Step 5 (persisting the drafted markdown to the wiki) is the only remaining action. There are no unexpected results, errors, or deviations from the original plan. There is no indication that the task cannot be completed, and there is no need to replan. Proceed to Step 5 as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:17:49
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The original plan contained five steps, and all have been fully and successfully completed. Step 5 verified creation of the target wiki file with the required content, there were no errors or policy violations, and all outputs matched the expected results. No additional steps remain, and the requested plain-language explanation of CRM deal phases has been documented as specified. Task is therefore COMPLETE.
