Step 4: Draft a clear, plain-language explanation of how CRM deal phases work and the criteria for moving a customer from 'exploring' to 'active', based on the combined understanding from documentation and technical implementation.
Approach: Synthesize information from the wiki documentation (Step 1) and the technical implementation details (Step 2). Create a structured, human-friendly description that explains: (1) what the CRM deal phases are (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) and what each means; (2) how these phases are typically used by sales and account managers in practice; and (3) the explicit criteria or decision points for moving a customer from 'exploring' to 'active' (for example, signed agreement, first purchase order, confirmed project kickoff, or similar rules as discovered). Ensure the language is non-technical and oriented to everyday business users, but remains aligned with the actual allowed values and any automated behavior that exists. The draft should be ready to be pasted into markdown, but this step only produces the text content and not the wiki write itself.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"draft_markdown":{"type":"string"},"sources_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["draft_markdown","sources_used"]}
