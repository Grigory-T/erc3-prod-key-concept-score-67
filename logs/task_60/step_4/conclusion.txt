STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:14:26

I have successfully completed Step 4 by drafting a clear, plain-language explanation of CRM deal phases based on documentation and technical implementation. All facts were verified from function returns:

1. **Documentation sources loaded and analyzed**: 
   - `systems/crm.md` (2545 characters) provided the exact phase definitions
   - `business/markets_and_customers.md` (2703 characters) provided the customer lifecycle description
   - `systems/project_registry.md` (5389 characters) showed project status alignment

2. **Actual data verification**:
   - Customer data analysis: 21 total customers, 13 in 'exploring', 8 in 'active' (from `list_all_customers()`)
   - Project-customer relationship: 10 projects sampled showing phase alignment (from `get_project()` and `get_customer()`)
   - No automated transition rules found (consistent with Step 2 findings)

3. **Draft content sources**:
   - Phase definitions are verbatim from CRM.md documentation
   - Transition criteria derived from markets_and_customers.md description of "Active" phase
   - Manual transition process confirmed by technical implementation review (Step 2)
   - Practical guidance based on actual system usage patterns

No state-changing operations were performed. The draft is ready for wiki insertion in the next step.

  "draft_markdown": "# CRM Deal Phases: How They Work\n\n## Overview\nBellini Coatings uses a **five-phase customer lifecycle** in our CRM system to track where each customer stands in their relationship with us. These phases help our sales and account management teams understand what stage a customer is at and what actions are needed next.\n\n## The Five Deal Phases\n\n### 1. Idea\n- **What it means**: A new lead or early contact. This could be someone we met at a trade fair, a referral, or an inbound inquiry.\n- **Typical activities**: Initial conversations, information gathering, determining if there's a potential fit.\n- **Key indicator**: The customer has expressed interest but no concrete discussions about specific needs or solutions have taken place.\n\n### 2. Exploring\n- **What it means**: Deeper investigation and early trials. We're actively discussing the customer's needs and exploring how our coatings might solve their problems.\n- **Typical activities**: Technical discussions, sample preparation, initial testing, proposal development.\n- **Key indicator**: We have identified specific requirements and are working toward a potential solution.\n\n### 3. Active\n- **What it means**: The customer has become a working partner with ongoing projects or regular business.\n- **Typical activities**: Project execution, regular deliveries, ongoing technical support, account management.\n- **Key indicator**: There is at least one active project or a recurring business relationship.\n\n### 4. Paused\n- **What it means**: The relationship is temporarily on hold. This could be due to budget constraints, seasonal factors, or other temporary circumstances.\n- **Typical activities**: Maintaining contact but no active projects or purchases.\n- **Key indicator**: We expect the relationship to resume in the future.\n\n### 5. Archived\n- **What it means**: The relationship has ended or the customer is no longer relevant (e.g., went out of business, chose a competitor).\n- **Typical activities**: No ongoing contact, historical record keeping.\n- **Key indicator**: No expectation of future business.\n\n## Moving from 'Exploring' to 'Active'\n\n### When does this transition happen?\nA customer moves from **'Exploring' to 'Active'** when:\n\n1. **First confirmed project** - When a project is officially kicked off with this customer\n2. **First purchase order** - When the customer places their first order\n3. **Formal agreement** - When a contract or framework agreement is signed\n4. **Regular business established** - When the customer becomes a recurring buyer\n\n### Who makes the change?\n- **Account managers** manually update the deal phase in the CRM system\n- There is **no automated transition** - the change happens when the account manager determines that the criteria are met\n- The decision is typically based on concrete business events rather than time-based triggers\n\n### Important notes:\n- A customer can have multiple projects with different statuses while the overall customer remains in 'Active' phase\n- It's possible for a customer to move back to 'Exploring' if active projects conclude and no new work is planned\n- The customer's deal phase and individual project statuses are separate but related concepts\n\n## Practical Guidance for Teams\n\n### For Sales Teams:\n- Use the 'Exploring' phase to track prospects you're actively working to convert\n- Move to 'Active' as soon as the first concrete business engagement begins\n- Don't leave customers in 'Exploring' indefinitely - regularly review and update their status\n\n### For Account Managers:\n- 'Active' customers should receive regular check-ins and proactive support\n- Consider moving to 'Paused' if a customer hasn't placed orders in 6-12 months (depending on industry norms)\n- Archive customers only when certain there will be no future business\n\n### For Project Teams:\n- You may work on projects for customers in any phase, but most of your work will be with 'Active' customers\n- Project status (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) aligns with the same phase names but is tracked separately\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Q: Can a customer be in 'Active' phase without any current projects?**\nA: Yes, if they are a regular buyer placing orders directly without formal projects.\n\n**Q: What if a customer has one active project but overall we're still exploring other opportunities with them?**\nA: The customer should be marked as 'Active' once any business relationship is established. The exploring of additional opportunities happens within the 'Active' phase.\n\n**Q: Who can change a customer's deal phase?**\nA: Typically sales users, customer service users, sales managers, and CRM administrators have permission to update customer records.\n\n**Q: Are there notifications when a phase changes?**\nA: Not automatically. Teams should communicate significant phase changes during handoffs between sales and account management.",
