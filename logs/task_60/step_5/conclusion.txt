Step 5 has been successfully executed by writing the drafted explanation into the wiki as a new markdown file. All actions were performed as per the step instruction:

1. **Verified File Status**: Checked existing wiki files using `list_wiki()` and confirmed that 'draft_deal_workflow.md' did not exist (found in 19 files, target not present).

2. **Content Safety Check**: Scanned the draft markdown content for sensitive terms (salary, wage, pay, compensation, hr note, confidential) and found none, ensuring compliance with company rules.

3. **Wiki Write Operation**: Called `update_wiki()` with exact path 'draft_deal_workflow.md', the full draft content from Step 4 (4,863 characters), and changed_by set to the current user ID (BwFV_001). The function returned `True`, indicating success.

4. **Verification of Write**: Loaded the file back using `load_wiki()` and confirmed the content matches exactly what was written.

5. **Final State Capture**: After the operation, checked the wiki files again and verified that 'draft_deal_workflow.md' now exists. Since it was not present before, it was created (not updated).

State Change: The wiki system was updated with a new file 'draft_deal_workflow.md', authored by BwFV_001 via the chatbot/AI channel, as recorded in the change log.
