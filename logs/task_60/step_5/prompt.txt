Step 5: Write the drafted explanation into the wiki as a markdown file at path 'draft_deal_workflow.md', creating or updating the wiki_file entry as needed.
Approach: Assuming Step 3 confirmed that Manuela can write to the wiki, take the markdown content produced in Step 4 and persist it into the wiki_file table with path exactly 'draft_deal_workflow.md'. If a row with that path already exists, update its content and sha1 (if managed) and set updated_at to the current timestamp; if no row exists, insert a new one. Ensure only the deal workflow explanation and related non-sensitive process information are stored, with no individual salaries or confidential human resources notes. This step should handle any path lookup using exact matching on 'draft_deal_workflow.md'; if for some reason similar paths exist, still use exact match for this target, not fuzzy. Confirm that the write succeeded and capture the final state (path and a confirmation flag).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"created":{"type":"boolean"},"updated":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["path","created","updated"]}
