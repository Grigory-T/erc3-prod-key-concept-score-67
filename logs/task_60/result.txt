Outcome: ok_answer
Message: A clear, plain-language explanation of how CRM deal phases work and when a customer moves from 'exploring' to 'active' was drafted and successfully saved as a new wiki markdown file at 'draft_deal_workflow.md'. The explanation covers:

- The five CRM deal phases: idea, exploring, active, paused, archived
- What each phase means
- Typical activities and key indicators for each phase
- The criteria for moving a customer from 'exploring' to 'active' (first project kickoff, first purchase order, signed agreement, or established regular business)
- That account managers manually update the deal phase in the CRM (no automated transition)
- Guidance for sales, account management, and project teams on maintaining and updating deal phases
- Frequently asked questions about deal phases and permissions

The wiki was updated without errors. The file did not previously exist and was created by the system for employee Manuela Valli (BwFV_001) in line with company policies. No sensitive or confidential data was included in the document.
