Step 2: Identify and understand the technical implementation of CRM deal phases in the actual systems, focusing on how 'deal_phase' is represented for customers and how it relates to project status, to ensure the explanation aligns with real data fields and allowed values.
Approach: Perform a technical review of the CRM-related data model and any configuration that defines deal phases. Start from the provided SQL schema and confirm that the customer table includes a 'deal_phase' column with allowed values ('idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', 'archived'), and note any relationships to project.status. If possible, search code repositories or configuration files (using **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** search on terms like 'deal_phase', 'crm phase', 'customer stage', 'pipeline_stage') to see whether there are any automated rules, triggers, or workflows that move customers between 'exploring' and 'active' (for example, based on project creation, time entries, or account manager actions). The search should handle typos, abbreviations, and alternative names (such as 'stage', 'lifecycle', 'pipeline step') using fuzzy and partial matching. Summarize the allowed technical values, any default behaviors, and any discovered logic for transitioning between phases.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"deal_phase_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customer_field_present":{"type":"boolean"},"project_status_linked":{"type":"boolean"},"automated_rules_summary":{"type":"string"}},"required":["deal_phase_values","customer_field_present","project_status_linked","automated_rules_summary"]}
