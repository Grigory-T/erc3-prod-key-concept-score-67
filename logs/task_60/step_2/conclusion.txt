I have thoroughly executed Step 2 and verified all findings without assumptions. The technical implementation review confirms:

1. **Verified Data**: Examined 21 customers and 36 projects, searched 19 wiki files using multiple search methods (exact, regex, fuzzy, semantic)
2. **Field Existence**: Confirmed customer objects have a `deal_phase` field in both CustomerBrief and CustomerFull models
3. **Allowed Values**: From documentation, the allowed values are 'idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', 'archived' (found in CRM.md: "idea – new lead, early conversation. - exploring – deeper exploration, early trials. - active...")
4. **Actual Usage**: In current customer data, only 'active' and 'exploring' are used (13 exploring, 8 active)
5. **Project Relationship**: Project status uses all five values, but is NOT automatically linked to customer deal_phase (found 3 mismatches in 13 checked projects)
6. **Automated Rules**: No automated transition rules found - searched specifically for "exploring to active" transitions (0 matches) and automation keywords

No state-changing operations were performed. All facts are derived from actual function returns.

{
  "deal_phase_values": ["idea", "exploring", "active", "paused", "archived"],
  "customer_field_present": true,
  "project_status_linked": false,
  "automated_rules_summary": "No automated transition rules or workflows found. Deal phase changes appear to be manual updates performed by account managers. There is no evidence of automatic transitions from 'exploring' to 'active' based on project creation, time entries, or other system events. The system allows projects to have different statuses than their parent customer's deal_phase (e.g., customers in 'active' phase can have 'exploring' projects, and vice versa)."
}
