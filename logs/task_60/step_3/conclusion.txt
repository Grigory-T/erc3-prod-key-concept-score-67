STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I have re-verified Step 3 by thoroughly executing all required checks. I found a critical issue: I cannot verify the user's system_roles as required by the expected output because the available API functions do not provide this information. The `who_am_i()` function returns a `WhoAmI` object that does not contain a `system_roles` field, and the `get_employee()` function returns `EmployeeFull` objects that also don't have system_roles.

I executed the following verification:

1. **Confirmed user identity**: Manuela Valli (ID: BwFV_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy is authenticated.

2. **Checked file existence**: 'draft_deal_workflow.md' does not exist in the wiki (will be created).

3. **Attempted to get system_roles**: 
   - Called `get_employee("BwFV_001")` to check employee object structure
   - The returned `EmployeeFull` object has fields: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, wills
   - No system_roles field exists in the returned object

4. **No backend_permission_check function exists**: The available functions don't include a permission check function for wiki operations.

5. **Content sensitivity check**: This is a pre-check for future content, which cannot be performed until the actual content is drafted.

Given these limitations, I cannot fully satisfy the expected output requirements. The step requires `system_roles` array and a proper permission check, but the API doesn't provide these capabilities.

No state-changing operations were performed. Only read operations were executed.
