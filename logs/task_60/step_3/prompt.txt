Step 3: Check that the current user, Manuela Valli (BwFV_001), has permission to create or update wiki documentation, specifically the file 'draft_deal_workflow.md', ensuring there are no access or policy violations before writing.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint to confirm the authenticated user context (id, department, location, system_roles). Then perform a backend_permission_check or equivalent for a Wiki write operation for path 'draft_deal_workflow.md'. Verify that there is no policy restriction preventing Manuela from writing to wiki_file, and ensure that the content will not include sensitive personal data such as individual salaries or confidential human resources notes, in line with company rules. If permissions are denied, plan to abort the task; if permissions are allowed, proceed to drafting. This step should not actually write to the wiki, only determine whether writing is permitted.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_write_wiki":{"type":"boolean"},"deny_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_write_wiki","deny_reason"]}
