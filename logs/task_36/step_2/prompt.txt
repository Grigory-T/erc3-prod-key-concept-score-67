Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user BwFV_133 (Alessandro Romano) to determine whether he is allowed to read CEO approval notes (in employee notes) and modify salary for the identified employees.
Approach: Call an internal `who_am_i()` or equivalent authorization service to confirm the current user identity, department, location, and system roles for BwFV_133. Using the company-specific permission rules, evaluate for each target employee whether Alessandro is (a) the employee himself, (b) an executive level user (for example, one of the executives such as Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, or Filip Novak), or (c) otherwise authorized to access salary and sensitive notes. Apply the stated company policy that salary, wages, and payments can only be accessed by the employee himself or by executive level users; no other access is allowed. Based on this, compute per-employee flags `can_read_notes` (for CEO approval notes) and `can_update_salary`, and derive an overall `can_proceed` flag which must be true only if the user is allowed to both read relevant approval notes and update salary for all employees that were found in Step 1.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"employees_permissions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_notes":{"type":"boolean"},"can_update_salary":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","can_read_notes","can_update_salary"]}},"can_proceed":{"type":"boolean"},"denied_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_roles","employees_permissions","can_proceed","denied_reason"]}
