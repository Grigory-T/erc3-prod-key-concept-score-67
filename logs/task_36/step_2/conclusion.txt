STEP 2 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:05:11

I have successfully executed Step 2 exactly as instructed. Here's my verification against the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I called `who_am_i()` to confirm current user identity, department, and location. I used `get_employee()` to get the current user's full name to check if they are an executive. I evaluated permissions for each target employee based on the stated company policy.

2. **No skipped or assumed actions**: 
   - I didn't skip any authorization checks - I explicitly checked if the current user is each target employee or an executive
   - I used the actual executive names from the company information (Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak)
   - I applied the exact policy stated in the step: "salary, wages, and payments can only be accessed by the employee himself or by executive level users"
   - All data used came from function returns: `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - Current user identity: BwFV_133 from `who_am_i()`
   - Current user name: Alessandro Romano from `get_employee('BwFV_133')`
   - Executive status: Verified by comparing "Alessandro Romano" against the three executive names
   - Target employee IDs: Used the exact list from Step 1 (BwFV_151, BwFV_152, BwFV_153, BwFV_154)
   - All boolean flags were computed based on verified facts

4. **JSON response contains only verified values**: All values in the JSON come from explicitly printed function returns or logical computations based on those returns.

5. **No state-changing functions called**: I only used read-only functions (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`).

6. **Note on system_roles**: The `who_am_i()` function doesn't provide system_roles, so I used an empty array as indicated in the code execution. This is based on the actual API limitation.

The permissions check is complete and accurate based on the available information and company policy.
