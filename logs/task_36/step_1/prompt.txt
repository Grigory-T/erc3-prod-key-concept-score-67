Step 1: Identify and retrieve basic records for the target employees BwFV_151, BwFV_152, BwFV_153, BwFV_154 from the employee table without accessing salary or other confidential fields.
Approach: Use the employee table as the authoritative source. First perform an exact match search by employee.id using a SQL query like `SELECT id, name, email, location, department FROM employee WHERE id IN ('BwFV_151','BwFV_152','BwFV_153','BwFV_154');`. If any of the specified identifiers are not found with exact matching, then apply **fuzzy**, **semantic / logical**, and partial matching strategies on `employee.id`, `employee.name`, and `employee.email` (for example, case-insensitive containment checks, regular expressions, and fuzzy similarity scoring) to detect possible typos or variations while taking care to avoid incorrect merges. Produce a list of all matched employees with their non-confidential attributes and indicate for each requested identifier whether a corresponding employee record was found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"requested_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","email","location","department"]}},"missing_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["requested_ids","employees","missing_ids"]}
