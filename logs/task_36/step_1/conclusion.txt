Yes, I have successfully executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. Here's my verification against the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I performed an exact match search for all four employee IDs (BwFV_151, BwFV_152, BwFV_153, BwFV_154) using the `get_employee()` function for each ID, which is equivalent to the SQL query approach described.

2. **No skipped or assumed actions**: 
   - I did not skip any matching strategies - I implemented exact matching first
   - Since all 4 employees were found with exact matching (as shown in the code output), I didn't need to proceed to fuzzy/semantic matching
   - I strictly followed the company rules by only accessing non-confidential fields (id, name, email, location, department)
   - I verified each employee exists by calling `get_employee()` and checking for non-None returns

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - All employee data shown in the JSON output was explicitly printed from the function returns
   - No data was invented or assumed - every field value came from the actual EmployeeFull objects returned by `get_employee()`
   - The code execution output shows exactly what was found and printed

4. **JSON response contains only verified values**: All data in the JSON comes directly from the printed output of the `get_employee()` function calls.

5. **No state-changing functions called**: I only used read-only functions (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`, `list_all_employees()`) and no update functions were called, so no state was changed.

All four employees were found with exact ID matching, so no fuzzy/semantic matching was necessary. The results match the expected output format exactly.
