## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target employee record corresponding to the name 'Lorenzo Monti' in the employee table so that subsequent time entry queries can use the correct employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the employee whose name matches the input string 'Lorenzo Monti'. First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee.name and potentially employee.email to account for possible misspellings, partial names, different orderings, or similar variants (e.g., 'L. Monti', 'Lorenzo M.', 'Lorenco Monty'). Use strategies such as lowercasing and trimming whitespace, substring checks ("lorenzo" in name, "monti" in name), regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g., Levenshtein distance). If multiple candidates are found, select the one with the highest confidence score above a reasonable threshold; if ambiguity remains, note that multiple possible matches exist. The search should explicitly account for potential typos and misspellings in names.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"input_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "matched_employee_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_confidence": {"type": ["number", "null"]}}, "required": ["input_name", "employee_id", "employee_found"]}
**Result:** The step has been successfully executed. I identified the employee record for 'Lorenzo Monti' by querying the employee table. I first attempted an exact match on employee.name, which succeeded immediately. I found an exact match with 100% confidence: employee ID QR23_053 corresponds to the name 'Lorenzo Monti'. No fuzzy or semantic search was needed as an exact match was found. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "input_name": "Lorenzo Monti",
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "employee_found": true,
  "matched_employee_name": "Lorenzo Monti",
  "match_confidence": 1.0
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check the current user's identity and permissions to ensure that user 'QR23_133' (Armando Fontana, Human Resources) is authorized to view time entries for the identified employee.
Approach: Use a who_am_i()-style lookup to confirm the current user's id, department, location, and system roles from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent authorization source. Then, applying the company access control policies, determine whether a Human Resources department user with this identity is permitted to READ time_entry records for the target employee_id found in Step 1. This check MUST be done after the target employee is known. Do not perform any time_entry queries if permission is not granted. The evaluation should yield a clear boolean flag indicating access allowed or denied, and a non-sensitive textual reason.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "can_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "current_user_department", "current_user_roles", "target_employee_id", "can_view_time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully re-executed Step 2 with careful verification of all facts from function returns. The current user is confirmed to be QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) from the Human Resources (HR) department. I verified that neither the who_am_i() function nor the get_employee() function returns system_roles information. Based on the available company rules and the user's HR department role, and considering that no explicit restrictions exist for HR viewing time entries, I have determined that the user can view time entries for the target employee. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "QR23_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "can_view_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User is in HR department, which typically requires access to time entries for payroll and compliance. No explicit restriction found in company rules. Note: System roles could not be verified via available API functions."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), without filtering by status, in order to have the raw data for further aggregation.
Approach: If and only if Step 2 indicates that can_view_time_entries is true and an employee_id was successfully determined in Step 1, execute a SQL query against the time_entry table selecting all rows where time_entry.employee_id equals the target employee_id AND time_entry.entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not impose additional filters on status (include 'draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'invoiced', 'voided') since the task literally asks for hours logged in that period. Select at least the following fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. If no rows are returned, the list will be empty. No fuzzy searching is needed for dates, but ensure correct date range boundaries are used exactly as stated.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I verified that Step 2 indicated can_view_time_entries = true and employee_id = "QR23_053" was successfully determined in Step 1. I executed the search_time_entries function with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", and date_to="2025-02-28", retrieving all 3 time entries without any status filtering. All fields (id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id) were explicitly printed from the function returns and used in the JSON response. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "start_date": "2025-02-01",
  "end_date": "2025-02-28",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_010",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-03",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_nordic_cold_storage",
      "project_id": "proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_011",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-10",
      "hours": 2.0,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_nordic_cold_storage",
      "project_id": "proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_012",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-21",
      "hours": 4.5,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_alpinerail_maintenance",
      "project_id": "proj_alpinerail_depot_refurb"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to compute total hours, total billable hours, and total non-billable hours for the specified period.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate over each entry and sum the hours field. Compute three metrics: (1) total_hours as the sum of hours for all entries; (2) billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is true; and (3) non_billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is false. Handle the case of an empty list by returning zero for all sums. Ensure that decimal precision from the hours column (DECIMAL(4,2)) is preserved during summation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully with full verification. I executed the required aggregation by:

1. Verified the completeness of time entries by calling search_time_entries with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", date_to="2025-02-28" and maximum allowed limit of 5
2. Confirmed that exactly 3 entries were returned (matching Step 3 results) and next_offset was -1, indicating no more pages
3. Verified that the totals dict from the function returns matches our calculations: total_hours: 9.5, total_billable: 7.5, total_non_billable: 2.0
4. Verified each individual entry's details: te_010 (3.0h, billable), te_011 (2.0h, non-billable), te_012 (4.5h, billable)
5. Computed the aggregation from the verified entries: total_hours = 9.5, billable_hours = 7.5, non_billable_hours = 2.0

All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions. The search_time_entries function confirmed there are only 3 entries in the specified period, and the totals dict validates our calculations. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "start_date": "2025-02-01",
  "end_date": "2025-02-28",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Final Result
For the period from 2025-02-01 to 2025-02-28, Lorenzo Monti (employee ID: QR23_053) logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target employee record corresponding to the name 'Lorenzo Monti' in the employee table so that subsequent time entry queries can use the correct employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the employee whose name matches the input string 'Lorenzo Monti'. First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee.name and potentially employee.email to account for possible misspellings, partial names, different orderings, or similar variants (e.g., 'L.

The search should explicitly account for potential typos and misspellings in names.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"input_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "matched_employee_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_confidence": {"type": ["number", "null"]}}, "required": ["input_name", "employee_id", "employee_found"]}
**Result:** The step has been successfully executed. I identified the employee record for 'Lorenzo Monti' by querying the employee table. I first attempted an exact match on employee.name, which succeeded immediately. I found an exact match with 100% confidence: employee ID QR23_053 corresponds to the name 'Lorenzo Monti'. No fuzzy or semantic search was needed as an exact match was found. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "employee_found": true,
  "matched_employee_name": "Lorenzo Monti",
  "match_confidence": 1.0
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check the current user's identity and permissions to ensure that user 'QR23_133' (Armando Fontana, Human Resources) is authorized to view time entries for the identified employee.
Approach: Use a who_am_i()-style lookup to confirm the current user's id, department, location, and system roles from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent authorization source. Then, applying the company access control policies, determine whether a Human Resources department user with this identity is permitted to READ time_entry records for the target employee_id found in Step 1. This check MUST be done after the target employee is known. Do not perform any time_entry queries if permission is not granted. The evaluation should yield a clear boolean flag indicating access allowed or denied, and a non-sensitive textual reason.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "can_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "current_user_department", "current_user_roles", "target_employee_id", "can_view_time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully re-executed Step 2 with careful verification of all facts from function returns. The current user is confirmed to be QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) from the Human Resources (HR) department. I verified that neither the who_am_i() function nor the get_employee() function returns system_roles information. Based on the available company rules and the user's HR department role, and considering that no explicit restrictions exist for HR viewing time entries, I have determined that the user can view time entries for the target employee. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "QR23_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "can_view_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User is in HR department, which typically requires access to time entries for payroll and compliance. No explicit restriction found in company rules. Note: System roles could not be verified via available API functions."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), without filtering by status, in order to have the raw data for further aggregation.
Approach: If and only if Step 2 indicates that can_view_time_entries is true and an employee_id was successfully determined in Step 1, execute a SQL query against the time_entry table selecting all rows where time_entry.employee_id equals the target employee_id AND time_entry.entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not impose additional filters on status (include 'draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'invoiced', 'voided') since the task literally asks for hours logged in that period. Select at least the following fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. If no rows are returned, the list will be empty. No fuzzy searching is needed for dates, but ensure correct date range boundaries are used exactly as stated.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I verified that Step 2 indicated can_view_time_entries = true and employee_id = "QR23_053" was successfully determined in Step 1. I executed the search_time_entries function with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", and date_to="2025-02-28", retrieving all 3 time entries without any status filtering. All fields (id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id) were explicitly printed from the function returns and used in the JSON response. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to compute total hours, total billable hours, and total non-billable hours for the specified period.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate over each entry and sum the hours field. Compute three metrics: (1) total_hours as the sum of hours for all entries; (2) billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is true; and (3) non_billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is false. Handle the case of an empty list by returning zero for all sums. Ensure that decimal precision from the hours column (DECIMAL(4,2)) is preserved during summation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully with full verification. I executed the required aggregation by:

1. Verified the completeness of time entries by calling search_time_entries with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", date_to="2025-02-28" and maximum allowed limit of 5
2. Confirmed that exactly 3 entries were returned (matching Step 3 results) and next_offset was -1, indicating no more pages
3. Verified that the totals dict from the function returns matches our calculations: total_hours: 9.5, total_billable: 7.5, total_non_billable: 2.0
4. Verified each individual entry's details: te_010 (3.0h, billable), te_011 (2.0h, non-billable), te_012 (4.5h, billable)
5. Computed the aggregation from the verified entries: total_hours = 9.5, billable_hours = 7.5, non_billable_hours = 2.0

All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions. The search_time_entries function confirmed there are only 3 entries in the specified period, and the totals dict validates our calculations. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "start_date": "2025-02-01",
  "end_date": "2025-02-28",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Final Result
For the period from 2025-02-01 to 2025-02-28, Lorenzo Monti (employee ID: QR23_053) logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
