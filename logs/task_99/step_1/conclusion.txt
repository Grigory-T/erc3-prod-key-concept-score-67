The step has been successfully executed. I identified the employee record for 'Lorenzo Monti' by querying the employee table. I first attempted an exact match on employee.name, which succeeded immediately. I found an exact match with 100% confidence: employee ID QR23_053 corresponds to the name 'Lorenzo Monti'. No fuzzy or semantic search was needed as an exact match was found. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
