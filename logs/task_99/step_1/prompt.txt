Step 1: Identify the target employee record corresponding to the name 'Lorenzo Monti' in the employee table so that subsequent time entry queries can use the correct employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the employee whose name matches the input string 'Lorenzo Monti'. First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee.name and potentially employee.email to account for possible misspellings, partial names, different orderings, or similar variants (e.g., 'L. Monti', 'Lorenzo M.', 'Lorenco Monty'). Use strategies such as lowercasing and trimming whitespace, substring checks ("lorenzo" in name, "monti" in name), regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g., Levenshtein distance). If multiple candidates are found, select the one with the highest confidence score above a reasonable threshold; if ambiguity remains, note that multiple possible matches exist. The search should explicitly account for potential typos and misspellings in names.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"input_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "matched_employee_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_confidence": {"type": ["number", "null"]}}, "required": ["input_name", "employee_id", "employee_found"]}
