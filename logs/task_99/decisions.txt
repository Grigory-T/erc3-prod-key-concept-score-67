DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:25:11
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is progressing as expected. Step 1 succeeded: the employee 'Lorenzo Monti' was found with exact match and correct ID, so there is no need to replan. The output matches the plan's requirements. No errors or unexpected results have occurred. According to the original plan, the next step is to verify whether the current user ('QR23_133', Armando Fontana, Human Resources) has access to view time entries for Lorenzo Monti. This is necessary before proceeding with the retrieval or aggregation of time entries. The task can still be completed as planned with the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:30:02
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous steps have proceeded exactly according to the original plan: the exact employee match for 'Lorenzo Monti' was found (Step 1), the HR user's permission to view time entries was validated according to company policy (Step 2), and all outputs matched expected results. The next step (Step 3) is to actually retrieve time entry records, which is appropriate and necessary per the plan. No new information or inconsistencies require replanning, and the task can still be completed as originally intended.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:31:39
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The process has proceeded as per the original plan and all step outputs match expected results. Employee 'Lorenzo Monti' was identified with high certainty, permissions were confirmed, and all relevant time entries were retrieved with full required data. No inconsistencies or missing information are present, and aggregation and final answer steps can be carried out exactly as planned. There are no blockers or surprises to suggest replanning, abort, or task completion at this point.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:35:27
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
Each step of the original plan has been executed successfully and has produced the expected and correct results. The relevant employee ('Lorenzo Monti') was uniquely and confidently identified. The current user's access permissions were validated and found sufficient according to company policy. All relevant time entries for the specified period were retrieved and the aggregation (total, billable, and non-billable hours) matches raw data and verified function outputs. There are no discrepancies or missing data. The only remaining step is to present the final answer summarizing the computed totals in plain text. No replanning or abort is required.
