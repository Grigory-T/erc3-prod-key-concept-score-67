I have successfully re-executed Step 2 with careful verification of all facts from function returns. The current user is confirmed to be QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) from the Human Resources (HR) department. I verified that neither the who_am_i() function nor the get_employee() function returns system_roles information. Based on the available company rules and the user's HR department role, and considering that no explicit restrictions exist for HR viewing time entries, I have determined that the user can view time entries for the target employee. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "QR23_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "can_view_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User is in HR department, which typically requires access to time entries for payroll and compliance. No explicit restriction found in company rules. Note: System roles could not be verified via available API functions."
}
