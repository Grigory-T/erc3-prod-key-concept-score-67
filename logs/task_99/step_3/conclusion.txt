Step 3 completed successfully. I verified that Step 2 indicated can_view_time_entries = true and employee_id = "QR23_053" was successfully determined in Step 1. I executed the search_time_entries function with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", and date_to="2025-02-28", retrieving all 3 time entries without any status filtering. All fields (id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id) were explicitly printed from the function returns and used in the JSON response. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
