We are currently at Step 3 of the global task.
 The goal of Step 3 is to retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee (employee_id from Step 1) between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive).
 We have already confirmed in Step 2 that the current user (QR23_133, HR) can view time entries for the target employee (QR23_053).

 Approach:
  1. We will use the search_time_entries function, providing:
        employee = "QR23_053"
        date_from = "2025-02-01"
        date_to = "2025-02-28"
        We do not set status, work_category, or billable filters to get all entries in that period.

  2. The function returns a tuple (entries, next_offset, totals). We are only interested in the entries.

  3. We need to extract for each entry: id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id.

  4. Note: The TimeEntry object has fields: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status.

  5. We should handle pagination because the limit is 5. We will loop until all entries are retrieved.

 Steps in code:

   a. Set the employee_id, start_date, end_date.
   b. Initialize an empty list for entries and set offset to 0.
   c. In a loop, call search_time_entries with the given parameters and offset.
   d. Append the current page of entries to our list.
   e. If next_offset is -1, break the loop; otherwise set offset to next_offset and continue.

   f. For each entry in the accumulated list, extract the required fields.

   g. Note: The TimeEntry object's date field is a string in YYYY-MM-DD format.

   h. The expected output is an object with employee_id, start_date, end_date, and time_entries array.

 Let's execute.

The user is executing Step 3 of a larger task. Step 3 requires retrieving time entries for employee QR23_053 between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28. The code has been executed and produced the expected output: 3 time entries.

The output must be in JSON format as specified in the Expected Output. The JSON should include:
- employee_id (string)
- start_date (string in date format)
- end_date (string in date format)
- time_entries (array of objects with id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id)

All fields are present. The entries have been formatted correctly.

I will now provide the final answer.

We are verifying that Step 3 has been executed correctly according to the instructions and checklist.

Step 3 required:
1. Confirm that Step 2 indicated can_view_time_entries is true and an employee_id was successfully determined in Step 1.
   - From Step 1: employee_id = "QR23_053"
   - From Step 2: can_view_time_entries = true

2. Execute a query to get all time entries for the employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 inclusive, without filtering by status.

3. The query should return at least: id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id.

We executed:
   search_time_entries(employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", date_to="2025-02-28")

We retrieved 3 entries, and the function returned:
   - Entry 1: ID=te_010, Date=2025-02-03, Hours=3.0, Billable=True, Status=submitted, Customer=cust_nordic_cold_storage, Project=proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial
   - Entry 2: ID=te_011, Date=2025-02-10, Hours=2.0, Billable=False, Status=submitted, Customer=cust_nordic_cold_storage, Project=proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial
   - Entry 3: ID=te_012, Date=2025-02-21, Hours=4.5, Billable=True, Status=submitted, Customer=cust_alpinerail_maintenance, Project=proj_alpinerail_depot_refurb

We did not filter by status, and we got entries with status "submitted". The function `search_time_entries` by default does not filter by status unless specified.

We have all the required fields in the printed output.

We have formatted the entries as required in the JSON.

We did not perform any state-changing operations (only read operations).

Therefore, the step is complete and correct.

We will now provide the final answer and JSON again.
