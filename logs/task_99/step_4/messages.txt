## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-03-05
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_133
User details: {"id": "QR23_133", "name": "Armando Fontana", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: QR23_133
department: Human Resources (HR)
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-03-05
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, how many hours in total did Lorenzo Monti log, and how many of those hours were billable versus non‑billable?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target employee record corresponding to the name 'Lorenzo Monti' in the employee table so that subsequent time entry queries can use the correct employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the employee whose name matches the input string 'Lorenzo Monti'. First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee.name and potentially employee.email to account for possible misspellings, partial names, different orderings, or similar variants (e.g., 'L. Monti', 'Lorenzo M.', 'Lorenco Monty'). Use strategies such as lowercasing and trimming whitespace, substring checks ("lorenzo" in name, "monti" in name), regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g., Levenshtein distance). If multiple candidates are found, select the one with the highest confidence score above a reasonable threshold; if ambiguity remains, note that multiple possible matches exist. The search should explicitly account for potential typos and misspellings in names.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"input_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "employee_found": {"type": "boolean"}, "matched_employee_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "match_confidence": {"type": ["number", "null"]}}, "required": ["input_name", "employee_id", "employee_found"]}
**Result:** The step has been successfully executed. I identified the employee record for 'Lorenzo Monti' by querying the employee table. I first attempted an exact match on employee.name, which succeeded immediately. I found an exact match with 100% confidence: employee ID QR23_053 corresponds to the name 'Lorenzo Monti'. No fuzzy or semantic search was needed as an exact match was found. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "input_name": "Lorenzo Monti",
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "employee_found": true,
  "matched_employee_name": "Lorenzo Monti",
  "match_confidence": 1.0
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check the current user's identity and permissions to ensure that user 'QR23_133' (Armando Fontana, Human Resources) is authorized to view time entries for the identified employee.
Approach: Use a who_am_i()-style lookup to confirm the current user's id, department, location, and system roles from the EmployeeRegistry or equivalent authorization source. Then, applying the company access control policies, determine whether a Human Resources department user with this identity is permitted to READ time_entry records for the target employee_id found in Step 1. This check MUST be done after the target employee is known. Do not perform any time_entry queries if permission is not granted. The evaluation should yield a clear boolean flag indicating access allowed or denied, and a non-sensitive textual reason.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "can_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "current_user_department", "current_user_roles", "target_employee_id", "can_view_time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully re-executed Step 2 with careful verification of all facts from function returns. The current user is confirmed to be QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) from the Human Resources (HR) department. I verified that neither the who_am_i() function nor the get_employee() function returns system_roles information. Based on the available company rules and the user's HR department role, and considering that no explicit restrictions exist for HR viewing time entries, I have determined that the user can view time entries for the target employee. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_user_id": "QR23_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "can_view_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User is in HR department, which typically requires access to time entries for payroll and compliance. No explicit restriction found in company rules. Note: System roles could not be verified via available API functions."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), without filtering by status, in order to have the raw data for further aggregation.
Approach: If and only if Step 2 indicates that can_view_time_entries is true and an employee_id was successfully determined in Step 1, execute a SQL query against the time_entry table selecting all rows where time_entry.employee_id equals the target employee_id AND time_entry.entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not impose additional filters on status (include 'draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'invoiced', 'voided') since the task literally asks for hours logged in that period. Select at least the following fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. If no rows are returned, the list will be empty. No fuzzy searching is needed for dates, but ensure correct date range boundaries are used exactly as stated.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I verified that Step 2 indicated can_view_time_entries = true and employee_id = "QR23_053" was successfully determined in Step 1. I executed the search_time_entries function with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", and date_to="2025-02-28", retrieving all 3 time entries without any status filtering. All fields (id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id) were explicitly printed from the function returns and used in the JSON response. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_053",
  "start_date": "2025-02-01",
  "end_date": "2025-02-28",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_010",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-03",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_nordic_cold_storage",
      "project_id": "proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_011",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-10",
      "hours": 2.0,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_nordic_cold_storage",
      "project_id": "proj_nordiccold_freezer_floor_trial"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_012",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-21",
      "hours": 4.5,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_alpinerail_maintenance",
      "project_id": "proj_alpinerail_depot_refurb"
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to compute total hours, total billable hours, and total non-billable hours for the specified period.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate over each entry and sum the hours field. Compute three metrics: (1) total_hours as the sum of hours for all entries; (2) billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is true; and (3) non_billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is false. Handle the case of an empty list by returning zero for all sums. Ensure that decimal precision from the hours column (DECIMAL(4,2)) is preserved during summation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}

I'll execute Step 4 by aggregating the time entries from Step 3 to compute total hours, billable hours, and non-billable hours.

Step 4 completed successfully. I aggregated the 3 time entries retrieved in Step 3 for employee QR23_053 (Lorenzo Monti) between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28. The calculations show: total hours = 9.5, billable hours = 7.5, and non-billable hours = 2.0. The sum verification confirms the calculations are correct (total = billable + non-billable). No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to compute total hours, total billable hours, and total non-billable hours for the specified period.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate over each entry and sum the hours field. Compute three metrics: (1) total_hours as the sum of hours for all entries; (2) billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is true; and (3) non_billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is false. Handle the case of an empty list by returning zero for all sums. Ensure that decimal precision from the hours column (DECIMAL(4,2)) is preserved during summation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
Step 4 completed successfully with full verification. I executed the required aggregation by:

1. Verified the completeness of time entries by calling search_time_entries with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", date_to="2025-02-28" and maximum allowed limit of 5
2. Confirmed that exactly 3 entries were returned (matching Step 3 results) and next_offset was -1, indicating no more pages
3. Verified that the totals dict from the function returns matches our calculations: total_hours: 9.5, total_billable: 7.5, total_non_billable: 2.0
4. Verified each individual entry's details: te_010 (3.0h, billable), te_011 (2.0h, non-billable), te_012 (4.5h, billable)
5. Computed the aggregation from the verified entries: total_hours = 9.5, billable_hours = 7.5, non_billable_hours = 2.0

All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions. The search_time_entries function confirmed there are only 3 entries in the specified period, and the totals dict validates our calculations. No state-changing operations were performed.
