Step 4: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to compute total hours, total billable hours, and total non-billable hours for the specified period.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate over each entry and sum the hours field. Compute three metrics: (1) total_hours as the sum of hours for all entries; (2) billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is true; and (3) non_billable_hours as the sum of hours for entries where billable is false. Handle the case of an empty list by returning zero for all sums. Ensure that decimal precision from the hours column (DECIMAL(4,2)) is preserved during summation.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "start_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "end_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "start_date", "end_date", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
