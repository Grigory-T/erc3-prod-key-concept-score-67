Step 4 completed successfully with full verification. I executed the required aggregation by:

1. Verified the completeness of time entries by calling search_time_entries with employee="QR23_053", date_from="2025-02-01", date_to="2025-02-28" and maximum allowed limit of 5
2. Confirmed that exactly 3 entries were returned (matching Step 3 results) and next_offset was -1, indicating no more pages
3. Verified that the totals dict from the function returns matches our calculations: total_hours: 9.5, total_billable: 7.5, total_non_billable: 2.0
4. Verified each individual entry's details: te_010 (3.0h, billable), te_011 (2.0h, non-billable), te_012 (4.5h, billable)
5. Computed the aggregation from the verified entries: total_hours = 9.5, billable_hours = 7.5, non_billable_hours = 2.0

All facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions. The search_time_entries function confirmed there are only 3 entries in the specified period, and the totals dict validates our calculations. No state-changing operations were performed.
