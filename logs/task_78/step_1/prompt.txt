Step 1: Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}
