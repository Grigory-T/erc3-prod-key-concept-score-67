After thorough verification of the primary source documentation and system data, I can confirm the exact definitions used within Bellini Coatings:

**Workload Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md lines 64-68):**
"Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries with `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)."

**How workload is computed (lines 72-86):**
1. Collect all projects where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects
2. Extract each `TimeSlice` value for the employee from every such project
3. Sum all FTE slices to determine the employee's aggregate planned workload
4. This provides a forward-looking view of planned workload (distinct from actual time logs)

**Current Projects Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md line 75):**
"Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload."

**Verification Results:**
- All project status values in the system: ['active', 'archived', 'exploring', 'idea', 'paused']
- No conflicting definitions found - other files mention workload but are consistent
- No version conflicts or timestamps found in documentation
- The primary source (systems/project_registry.md) is the authoritative documentation

**Note:** The definition explicitly states that "exploring" projects are sometimes counted toward workload, indicating this may depend on context or reporting needs.
