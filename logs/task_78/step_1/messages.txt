## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-16
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_001
User details: {"id": "SrwB_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#      wills=wills_dicts, location=old.location, department=old.department)


update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:**  What is workload of Miroslav Kostić across current projects?

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 1: Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}

<final_answer>
Based on extensive search of the company wiki and analysis of system data, I have found clear definitions for both "workload" and "current projects" as used within Bellini Coatings.

**Workload Definition:** The most authoritative definition comes from the systems/project_registry.md wiki file (line 64): "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across current projects**. These allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload." This is further detailed in lines 72-86 which explain that workload is computed by summing all FTE slices (time_slice values) assigned to an employee across active projects, where 1.0 FTE represents full-time allocation.

**Current Projects Definition:** The same wiki file (line 75) states: "Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring` for planning) projects count toward current workload." This is consistent with the project status distribution found in the system (active: 15, exploring: 17, idea: 2, archived: 1, paused: 1).

**Key Points:**
1. Workload is measured as the sum of FTE slices (time_slice values) assigned to an employee across current projects
2. Current projects are those with status `active` or sometimes `exploring` (for planning purposes)
3. The time_slice field in team member assignments represents the fraction of full-time (FTE) allocated to that project
4. This planned workload (from project registry) is distinct from actual hours logged in time tracking

The definitions are consistent across documentation and match the actual data structures observed in project teams.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 1: Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

--- WORKLOAD DEFINITION SECTION (lines 60-100) ---
60:   - Improvements in production, logistics, quality, HR, IT and digitalisation.
61: 
62: ## Workload
63: 
64: Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:
65: 
66: * `Employee` – the employee ID
67: * `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)
68: * `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)
69: 
70: These allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.
71: 
72: ### How total workload is computed
73: 
74: 1. **Collect all projects** where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects unless explicitly included in reporting.
75:    Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload.
76: 
77: 2. **Extract each `TimeSlice` value** for the employee from every such project.
78:    For example, if an employee is allocated:
79: 
80:   * 0.5 FTE in Project A
81:   * 0.3 FTE in Project B
82:   * 0.2 FTE in Project C
83: 
84:    then their planned workload totals **1.0 FTE**.
85: 
86: 3. **Sum all FTE slices** to determine the employee’s **aggregate planned workload**.
87:    This provides a quick view of whether someone is under-allocated, fully allocated, or overloaded.
88: 
89: 4. **Compare allocations to actual time spent** (from time tracking) when needed.
90:    The time tracking system records real hours spent on each project and customer, which can be aggregated by employee. This allows managers to reconcile planned vs. actual workload.
91: 
92: ### Why this method is used
93: 
94: * It aligns with the project-centric way Bellini plans work: projects define who is involved and at what intensity.
95: * It provides a **forward-looking view** of workload independent of time logs, which reflect past activity.
96: * It supports cross-department planning, since employees often contribute to multiple projects concurrently.
97: 
98: ### How the workload data is used
99: 
100: * **Resource planning:** Department leads and project managers identify overload situations early.

After thorough verification of the primary source documentation and system data, I can confirm the exact definitions used within Bellini Coatings:

**Workload Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md lines 64-68):**
"Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries with `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)."

**How workload is computed (lines 72-86):**
1. Collect all projects where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects
2. Extract each `TimeSlice` value for the employee from every such project
3. Sum all FTE slices to determine the employee's aggregate planned workload
4. This provides a forward-looking view of planned workload (distinct from actual time logs)

**Current Projects Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md line 75):**
"Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload."

**Verification Results:**
- All project status values in the system: ['active', 'archived', 'exploring', 'idea', 'paused']
- No conflicting definitions found - other files mention workload but are consistent
- No version conflicts or timestamps found in documentation
- The primary source (systems/project_registry.md) is the authoritative documentation

**Note:** The definition explicitly states that "exploring" projects are sometimes counted toward workload, indicating this may depend on context or reporting needs.

{
  "workload_definition": "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing their allocated FTE slices across all active projects. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of Workload entries with TimeSlice – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0). Total workload is computed by: 1) Collecting all projects where the employee appears in the team list (excluding archived), 2) Extracting each TimeSlice value for the employee from every such project, 3) Summing all FTE slices to determine aggregate planned workload.",
  "current_projects_definition": "Projects can be in phases such as idea, exploring, active, or paused. Only active (and sometimes exploring) projects are normally counted toward real workload. Archived projects are explicitly excluded unless included in special reporting.",
