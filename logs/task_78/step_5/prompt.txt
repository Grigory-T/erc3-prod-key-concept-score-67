Step 5: Retrieve all "current" projects where the identified employee (Miroslav Kostić) is a team member, according to the technical and documentation definitions.
Approach: Provided that step 3 found a unique employee_id and step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, query the team_member and project tables to find all rows where team_member.employee_id equals the matched_employee_id and the linked project.id matches team_member.project_id. Filter projects by the status values determined as "current" in step 1 and step 2 (for example, include only project.status in current_status_values and exclude project.status in excluded_status_values). Use exact equality filters on employee_id and project_id; for status values, use exact matches to the enumerated statuses ('idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', 'archived'). If any project names or identifiers need to be checked for consistency, use partial and **FUZZY** matching only for display or auxiliary checks, but not to join tables. Return the list of all such project-team_member combinations, including project_id, project.name, project.status, team_member.role, and team_member.time_slice for each row.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_status_values_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"team_member_role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","team_member_role","time_slice"]}},"found_any_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","current_status_values_used","projects","found_any_projects"]}
