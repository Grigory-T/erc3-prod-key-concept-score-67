# Company: Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
Locations: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria
Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-16
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_001
User details: {"id": "SrwB_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:**  What is workload of Miroslav Kostić across current projects?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification of the primary source documentation and system data, I can confirm the exact definitions used within Bellini Coatings:

**Workload Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md lines 64-68):**
"Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries with `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)."

**How workload is computed (lines 72-86):**
1. Collect all projects where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects
2. Extract each `TimeSlice` value for the employee from every such project
3. Sum all FTE slices to determine the employee's aggregate planned workload
4. This provides a forward-looking view of planned workload (distinct from actual time logs)

**Current Projects Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md line 75):**
"Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload."

**Verification Results:**
- All project status values in the system: ['active', 'archived', 'exploring', 'idea', 'paused']
- No conflicting definitions found - other files mention workload but are consistent
- No version conflicts or timestamps found in documentation
- The primary source (systems/project_registry.md) is the authoritative documentation

**Note:** The definition explicitly states that "exploring" projects are sometimes counted toward workload, indicating this may depend on context or reporting needs.

{
  "workload_definition": "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing their allocated FTE slices across all active projects. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of Workload entries with TimeSlice – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0). Total workload is computed by: 1) Collecting all projects where the employee appears in the team list (excluding archived), 2) Extracting each TimeSlice value for the employee from every such project, 3) Summing all FTE slices to determine aggregate planned workload.",
  "current_projects_definition": "Projects can be in phases such as idea, exploring, active, or paused. Only active (and sometimes exploring) projects are normally counted toward real workload. Archived projects are explicitly excluded unless included in special reporting.",
  "source_paths": ["systems/project_registry.md", "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md", "company/locations_and_sites.md"],
  "definition_version_or_priority": "Authoritative definition from systems/project_registry.md (primary company documentation for project management)"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (tables, fields, or services) used to calculate workload and determine current projects, based on the data model and any APIs.
Approach: Inspect the available technical implementation (SQL schema, services, or APIs) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over object, table, and field names (accounting for typos and partial matches) to find how workload is represented. Specifically, look for structures such as team_member.time_slice, project.status, and possibly time_entry-based aggregation. Confirm which tables and fields should be used to compute workload for an employee across projects and which project.status values correspond to "current" according to step 1 (for example, map documentation definition like "non-archived projects" to concrete status values such as everything except 'archived', or a specific subset). If there are multiple possible implementations (for example, both planned allocation via team_member and historical workload via time_entry), record all and mark which one should be used to answer this type of question, following the priority indicated by documentation from step 1.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string"},"workload_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"project_status_field":{"type":"string"},"current_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"excluded_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["workload_source_type","workload_tables","workload_fields","project_status_field","current_status_values","excluded_status_values"]}
**Result:** I need to execute code to actually inspect the available technical implementation. My previous response was based on interpreting the definitions from Step 1, but I haven't actually examined the data structures and functions yet.

{"status": "needs_verification", "message": "Need to execute code to inspect actual technical implementation"}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" in the employee table to obtain the exact employee_id needed for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using the provided name "Miroslav Kostić". First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If not found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (lowercasing and trimming whitespace on both sides, and checking if the normalized query is contained in employee.name), then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name strings, handling diacritics like 'ć' vs 'c', possible misspellings, or inverted name order such as 'Kostić Miroslav'). If there are multiple potential matches, choose the best one by highest fuzzy score; if ambiguity remains (for example, multiple near-identical matches with close scores), mark that multiple candidates exist instead of arbitrarily picking one. Do not access or use salary information from the employee table. Only retrieve non-sensitive fields necessary for identification (id, name, email, location, department).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_list":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","matched_employee_name","match_confidence","multiple_candidates","candidate_list","found"]}

I'll execute Step 3 to locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić". Let me start by checking the current context and then search for this employee.

```python
# Step 1: Verify current context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Location: {ctx.location}")
print(f"Today: {ctx.today}")
print(f"Is public: {ctx.is_public}")

# Step 2: Get all employees to search through
print("\nFetching all employees...")
all_employees = list_all_employees()
print(f"Total employees found: {len(all_employees)}")

# Display first few for reference
print("\nFirst few employees:")
for i, emp in enumerate(all_employees[:5]):
    print(f"  {i+1}. {emp.id}: {emp.name} ({emp.department}, {emp.location})")
```

Now let me search for "Miroslav Kostić" using different approaches:

```python
# Step 3: Search for "Miroslav Kostić" using different approaches
target_name = "Miroslav Kostić"
print(f"\nSearching for employee: '{target_name}'")

# Approach 1: Exact name match
print("\n1. Exact name match:")

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" in the employee table to obtain the exact employee_id needed for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using the provided name "Miroslav Kostić". First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If not found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (lowercasing and trimming whitespace on both sides, and checking if the normalized query is contained in employee.name), then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name strings, handling diacritics like 'ć' vs 'c', possible misspellings, or inverted name order such as 'Kostić Miroslav'). If there are multiple potential matches, choose the best one by highest fuzzy score; if ambiguity remains (for example, multiple near-identical matches with close scores), mark that multiple candidates exist instead of arbitrarily picking one. Do not access or use salary information from the employee table. Only retrieve non-sensitive fields necessary for identification (id, name, email, location, department).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_list":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","matched_employee_name","match_confidence","multiple_candidates","candidate_list","found"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
