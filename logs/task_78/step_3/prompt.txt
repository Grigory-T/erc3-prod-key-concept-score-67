Step 3: Locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" in the employee table to obtain the exact employee_id needed for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using the provided name "Miroslav Kostić". First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If not found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (lowercasing and trimming whitespace on both sides, and checking if the normalized query is contained in employee.name), then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name strings, handling diacritics like 'ć' vs 'c', possible misspellings, or inverted name order such as 'Kostić Miroslav'). If there are multiple potential matches, choose the best one by highest fuzzy score; if ambiguity remains (for example, multiple near-identical matches with close scores), mark that multiple candidates exist instead of arbitrarily picking one. Do not access or use salary information from the employee table. Only retrieve non-sensitive fields necessary for identification (id, name, email, location, department).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_list":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","matched_employee_name","match_confidence","multiple_candidates","candidate_list","found"]}
