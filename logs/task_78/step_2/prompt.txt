Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (tables, fields, or services) used to calculate workload and determine current projects, based on the data model and any APIs.
Approach: Inspect the available technical implementation (SQL schema, services, or APIs) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over object, table, and field names (accounting for typos and partial matches) to find how workload is represented. Specifically, look for structures such as team_member.time_slice, project.status, and possibly time_entry-based aggregation. Confirm which tables and fields should be used to compute workload for an employee across projects and which project.status values correspond to "current" according to step 1 (for example, map documentation definition like "non-archived projects" to concrete status values such as everything except 'archived', or a specific subset). If there are multiple possible implementations (for example, both planned allocation via team_member and historical workload via time_entry), record all and mark which one should be used to answer this type of question, following the priority indicated by documentation from step 1.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string"},"workload_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"project_status_field":{"type":"string"},"current_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"excluded_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["workload_source_type","workload_tables","workload_fields","project_status_field","current_status_values","excluded_status_values"]}
