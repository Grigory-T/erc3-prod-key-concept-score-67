Total Time: 1327.7s

SCORE: None

Outcome: ok_answer
Message: Miroslav Kostić is currently allocated to a single active project: 'Workshop coating standards and training', where his role is QA and his planned time allocation (time_slice) is 0.3, meaning 30% of a full-time equivalent. His total current workload (planned, not logged) is therefore 0.3 FTE. This indicates he is significantly underallocated compared to full-time availability. No other current (active or exploring-status) projects are assigned to him at this time. There are no missing workload values; no sign of overallocation.
