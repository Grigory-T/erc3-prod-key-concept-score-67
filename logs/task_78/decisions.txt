DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:10:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully and fully in accordance with the original plan. The internal definitions of 'workload' and 'current projects' have been verified using authoritative documentation, with no conflicts or missing information. The resulting definitions are precise, cited, and fully aligned with what the next step of the plan requires. There is no evidence of blocking issues, inconsistencies, or missing data that would require replanning or aborting. The plan should therefore proceed to Step 2.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:12:25
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan requires verifying the actual technical implementation for workload tracking (Step 2), which has not yet been completed. The system indicated that it needs to inspect the data structures and code for the actual tables and fields to proceed. There is no unexpected or blocking issue—just an unmet requirement to run the next verification and, if successful, continue with employee lookup and subsequent steps. No replan is needed unless the next technical inspection returns a problem or missing resource. All previous steps provide correct and expected context.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:17:34
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is progressing according to the Original Plan. Step 3 successfully located the employee ('Miroslav Kostić', employee_id: SrwB_122) without any ambiguity, and there is no blocking issue. No unexpected or missing information has arisen that would require replanning or aborting. The next step is to verify permissions as per Step 4. According to the instructions, we should continue to the next step if all results so far are relevant and correct, which they are.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:20:22
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 through 4 have been completed successfully and produced the expected outputs as per the original plan. There are no blocking issues or missing data so far. Step 2 indicated that workload calculation is based on data structures (team_member.time_slice, project.status, etc.), but also flagged that actual technical implementation needs direct verification through code. This does not block the plan—it simply queues verification for workload calculation in Step 5, which is the next action. Since all necessary prerequisites are met and the task is still on track for completion, I should continue with the next planned step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:24:32
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced the expected, correct, and relevant outputs according to the original plan. There are no unexpected discrepancies or blocking issues. The next step (step 6) is to compute Miroslav Kostić's workload across his current projects using the provided project-team_member data, which has already been retrieved successfully. No replan or abort is needed. The plan is strictly on track.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:27:14
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have produced correct and expected results. Each previous step matched the plan’s requirements: definitions were found and confirmed; technical implementation was mapped; the target employee was unambiguously identified; permissions were confirmed; relevant projects were found and filtered by status; workload was computed per project and in total using the defined time_slice mechanism. No blocking issues or errors arose. There are no inconsistencies or missing data relevant to the task. Step 6 yields the definitive answer for Miroslav Kostić's workload. According to the plan, the task is now complete and a final answer can be given.
