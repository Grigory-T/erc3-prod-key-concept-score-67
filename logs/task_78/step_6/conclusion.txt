Step 6 completed successfully. Computed Miroslav Kostić's workload across current projects using the time_slice allocation method. The employee is allocated to one active project with a time slice of 0.3 (30% of full-time equivalent), resulting in total allocation of 0.3, which indicates underallocation relative to full capacity.
