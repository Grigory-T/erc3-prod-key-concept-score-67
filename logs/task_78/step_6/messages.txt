# Company: Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
Locations: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria
Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-16
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_001
User details: {"id": "SrwB_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:**  What is workload of Miroslav Kostić across current projects?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}
**Result:** After thorough verification of the primary source documentation and system data, I can confirm the exact definitions used within Bellini Coatings:

**Workload Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md lines 64-68):**
"Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries with `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)."

**How workload is computed (lines 72-86):**
1. Collect all projects where the employee appears in the team list, excluding archived projects
2. Extract each `TimeSlice` value for the employee from every such project
3. Sum all FTE slices to determine the employee's aggregate planned workload
4. This provides a forward-looking view of planned workload (distinct from actual time logs)

**Current Projects Definition (Verified from systems/project_registry.md line 75):**
"Projects can be in phases such as `idea`, `exploring`, `active`, or `paused`. Only `active` (and sometimes `exploring`) projects are normally counted toward real workload."

**Verification Results:**
- All project status values in the system: ['active', 'archived', 'exploring', 'idea', 'paused']
- No conflicting definitions found - other files mention workload but are consistent
- No version conflicts or timestamps found in documentation
- The primary source (systems/project_registry.md) is the authoritative documentation

**Note:** The definition explicitly states that "exploring" projects are sometimes counted toward workload, indicating this may depend on context or reporting needs.

{
  "workload_definition": "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing their allocated FTE slices across all active projects. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of Workload entries with TimeSlice – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0). Total workload is computed by: 1) Collecting all projects where the employee appears in the team list (excluding archived), 2) Extracting each TimeSlice value for the employee from every such project, 3) Summing all FTE slices to determine aggregate planned workload.",
  "current_projects_definition": "Projects can be in phases such as idea, exploring, active, or paused. Only active (and sometimes exploring) projects are normally counted toward real workload. Archived projects are explicitly excluded unless included in special reporting.",
  "source_paths": ["systems/project_registry.md", "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md", "company/locations_and_sites.md"],
  "definition_version_or_priority": "Authoritative definition from systems/project_registry.md (primary company documentation for project management)"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (tables, fields, or services) used to calculate workload and determine current projects, based on the data model and any APIs.
Approach: Inspect the available technical implementation (SQL schema, services, or APIs) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over object, table, and field names (accounting for typos and partial matches) to find how workload is represented. Specifically, look for structures such as team_member.time_slice, project.status, and possibly time_entry-based aggregation. Confirm which tables and fields should be used to compute workload for an employee across projects and which project.status values correspond to "current" according to step 1 (for example, map documentation definition like "non-archived projects" to concrete status values such as everything except 'archived', or a specific subset). If there are multiple possible implementations (for example, both planned allocation via team_member and historical workload via time_entry), record all and mark which one should be used to answer this type of question, following the priority indicated by documentation from step 1.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string"},"workload_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"project_status_field":{"type":"string"},"current_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"excluded_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["workload_source_type","workload_tables","workload_fields","project_status_field","current_status_values","excluded_status_values"]}
**Result:** I need to execute code to actually inspect the available technical implementation. My previous response was based on interpreting the definitions from Step 1, but I haven't actually examined the data structures and functions yet.

{"status": "needs_verification", "message": "Need to execute code to inspect actual technical implementation"}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" in the employee table to obtain the exact employee_id needed for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table using the provided name "Miroslav Kostić". First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If not found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (lowercasing and trimming whitespace on both sides, and checking if the normalized query is contained in employee.name), then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name strings, handling diacritics like 'ć' vs 'c', possible misspellings, or inverted name order such as 'Kostić Miroslav'). If there are multiple potential matches, choose the best one by highest fuzzy score; if ambiguity remains (for example, multiple near-identical matches with close scores), mark that multiple candidates exist instead of arbitrarily picking one. Do not access or use salary information from the employee table. Only retrieve non-sensitive fields necessary for identification (id, name, email, location, department).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_list":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","matched_employee_name","match_confidence","multiple_candidates","candidate_list","found"]}
**Result:** Successfully located the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" by querying the employee table using multiple search approaches. Found an exact match with employee_id SrwB_122 (Miroslav Kostić) with 100% confidence. There is one other employee with the same last name (Danijela Kostić, employee_id SrwB_107) but with lower confidence (60%), making Miroslav Kostić the unambiguous best match. All data was retrieved using read-only functions without accessing sensitive salary information.

{
  "query_name": "Miroslav Kostić",
  "matched_employee_id": "SrwB_122",
  "matched_employee_name": "Miroslav Kostić",
  "match_confidence": 1.0,
  "multiple_candidates": true,
  "candidate_list": [
    {
      "employee_id": "SrwB_122",
      "name": "Miroslav Kostić",
      "confidence": 1.0
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "SrwB_107",
      "name": "Danijela Kostić",
      "confidence": 0.6
    }
  ],
  "found": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify that the current user (Viola Messina, id SrwB_001) has permission to view another employee's workload across projects.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and authorization check to retrieve the current user id, department, location, and system_roles (for example, 'Executive Leadership', 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin'). Using this information, and the company policy that executives can access any project and client information, determine if Viola is considered an executive (for example, department 'Corporate Leadership' or specific executive roles). Since only executives and the employee themselves can access sensitive data like salary, but workload and project membership are not salary fields, focus on verifying that there is no specific restriction on viewing allocation/workload across projects. If the policy evaluation shows that Viola is allowed to view project and workload information for other employees, set has_permission to true; otherwise, set has_permission to false. This step should not read or expose salary fields. The permission decision should consider the identified target employee_id from step 3. If no valid employee was found in step 3, set has_permission to false with an appropriate reason indicating missing target employee context.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"user_department":{"type":["string","null"]},"user_location":{"type":["string","null"]},"user_system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"target_employee_id_requested":{"type":["string","null"]},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","user_department","user_location","user_system_roles","target_employee_id_requested","has_permission","reason"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed. Verified that current user Viola Messina (SrwB_001) has permission to view Miroslav Kostić's (SrwB_122) workload across projects. The user is in the Corporate Leadership department, which qualifies as executive level, granting permission to access any project and client information. All data was retrieved from function returns without accessing sensitive salary fields.

{
  "user_id": "SrwB_001",

  "user_location": "HQ – Italy",
  "user_system_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id_requested": "SrwB_122",

  "reason": "User is in Corporate Leadership department (executive level) which has permission to view project and workload information for any employee. System roles not available via current API, but department is sufficient for determining executive status per company policy."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve all "current" projects where the identified employee (Miroslav Kostić) is a team member, according to the technical and documentation definitions.
Approach: Provided that step 3 found a unique employee_id and step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, query the team_member and project tables to find all rows where team_member.employee_id equals the matched_employee_id and the linked project.id matches team_member.project_id. Filter projects by the status values determined as "current" in step 1 and step 2 (for example, include only project.status in current_status_values and exclude project.status in excluded_status_values). Use exact equality filters on employee_id and project_id; for status values, use exact matches to the enumerated statuses ('idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', 'archived'). If any project names or identifiers need to be checked for consistency, use partial and **FUZZY** matching only for display or auxiliary checks, but not to join tables. Return the list of all such project-team_member combinations, including project_id, project.name, project.status, team_member.role, and team_member.time_slice for each row.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_status_values_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"team_member_role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","team_member_role","time_slice"]}},"found_any_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","current_status_values_used","projects","found_any_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. Retrieved all current projects for Miroslav Kostić (employee_id: SrwB_122) by searching for projects where he is a team member and filtering by project status 'active' or 'exploring'. Found one current project: "Workshop coating standards and training" (ID: proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards) where he has the QA role with a 0.3 time slice allocation. No other current projects were found for this employee.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 6: Compute Miroslav Kostić's workload across the retrieved current projects based on the selected workload source (for example, time_slice fractions).
Approach: Using the project-team_member records from step 5 and the workload implementation choice from step 2 (for example, planned allocation via team_member.time_slice between 0.0 and 1.0), calculate the workload per project and in total. For each project, treat time_slice as the fraction of full-time allocation (for example, 0.50 means 50 percent of full-time). Sum all non-null time_slice values across all current projects to compute the total_allocation. If some time_slice values are null or missing, either treat them as 0.0 or flag them as unknown, following what step 1 and 2 indicated; in either case, report them explicitly. Optionally also compute basic statistics such as number_of_projects, minimum and maximum individual time_slice, and check if total_allocation exceeds 1.0 (indicating over-allocation) or is significantly below 1.0 (under-allocation). Do not log or persist any new data; just prepare these calculations for reporting.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"per_project_workload":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","time_slice"]}},"number_of_projects":{"type":"integer"},"total_allocation":{"type":["number","null"]},"has_missing_time_slices":{"type":"boolean"},"overallocated":{"type":"boolean"},"underallocated":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","per_project_workload","number_of_projects","total_allocation","has_missing_time_slices","overallocated","underallocated"]}

Step 6 completed successfully. Computed Miroslav Kostić's workload across current projects using the time_slice allocation method. The employee is allocated to one active project with a time slice of 0.3 (30% of full-time equivalent), resulting in total allocation of 0.3, which indicates underallocation relative to full capacity.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I confirm I executed the step instruction correctly. Let me verify the checklist:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** ✅ Yes, I computed Miroslav Kostić's workload across current projects using time_slice fractions as specified.

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** ✅ No, I:
   - Used the exact employee_id from step 3 (SrwB_122)
   - Filtered for current projects using statuses ['active', 'exploring'] as defined in step 5
   - Used the team_member.time_slice field as the workload source
   - Summed all non-null time_slice values
   - Calculated total allocation and checked for over/under allocation

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** ✅ Yes, all data comes from function returns:
   - Employee verification: `get_employee("SrwB_122")` returned Miroslav Kostić
   - Project search: `search_projects(team_employee="SrwB_122")` returned 1 project
   - Project details: `get_project("proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards")` returned active status and time_slice=0.3

4. **JSON contains only values from function returns:** ✅ Yes, all values were printed in the execution.

5. **No state-changing functions were called:** ✅ Only read operations (get_employee, search_projects, get_project).

The computation shows:
- 1 current project with time_slice=0.3
- Total allocation=0.3 (30% of FTE)
- Underallocated (less than 1.0)
- No missing time slices
