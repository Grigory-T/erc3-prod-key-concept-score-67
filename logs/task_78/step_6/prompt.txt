Step 6: Compute Miroslav Kostić's workload across the retrieved current projects based on the selected workload source (for example, time_slice fractions).
Approach: Using the project-team_member records from step 5 and the workload implementation choice from step 2 (for example, planned allocation via team_member.time_slice between 0.0 and 1.0), calculate the workload per project and in total. For each project, treat time_slice as the fraction of full-time allocation (for example, 0.50 means 50 percent of full-time). Sum all non-null time_slice values across all current projects to compute the total_allocation. If some time_slice values are null or missing, either treat them as 0.0 or flag them as unknown, following what step 1 and 2 indicated; in either case, report them explicitly. Optionally also compute basic statistics such as number_of_projects, minimum and maximum individual time_slice, and check if total_allocation exceeds 1.0 (indicating over-allocation) or is significantly below 1.0 (under-allocation). Do not log or persist any new data; just prepare these calculations for reporting.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"per_project_workload":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","time_slice"]}},"number_of_projects":{"type":"integer"},"total_allocation":{"type":["number","null"]},"has_missing_time_slices":{"type":"boolean"},"overallocated":{"type":"boolean"},"underallocated":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","per_project_workload","number_of_projects","total_allocation","has_missing_time_slices","overallocated","underallocated"]}
