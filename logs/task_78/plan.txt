Steps:
  1. Understand internal definitions of "workload" and "current projects" to know exactly what to compute for an employee's workload across projects.
     Approach: Search the internal wiki_file storage and any available company documentation for terms related to "workload", "capacity", "time_slice", and "current projects" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (accounting for abbreviations, typos, plural/singular forms, and synonyms like "allocation" or "utilization"). Focus on guidelines that define how workload is measured (for example, via team_member.time_slice as fraction of full-time, via recent time_entry hours, or a specific formula) and what statuses or criteria define a "current" project (for example, project.status in ['idea', 'exploring', 'active'] or explicitly excluding 'paused' and 'archived'). If multiple conflicting definitions are found, note all of them and which one is recommended or most recent based on timestamps or explicit notes in documentation.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_projects_definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"definition_version_or_priority":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["workload_definition","current_projects_definition","source_paths"]}
  2. Identify the concrete technical implementation (tables, fields, or services) used to calculate workload and determine current projects, based on the data model and any APIs.
     Approach: Inspect the available technical implementation (SQL schema, services, or APIs) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over object, table, and field names (accounting for typos and partial matches) to find how workload is represented. Specifically, look for structures such as team_member.time_slice, project.status, and possibly time_entry-based aggregation. Confirm which tables and fields should be used to compute workload for an employee across projects and which project.status values correspond to "current" according to step 1 (for example, map documentation definition like "non-archived projects" to concrete status values such as everything except 'archived', or a specific subset). If there are multiple possible implementations (for example, both planned allocation via team_member and historical workload via time_entry), record all and mark which one should be used to answer this type of question, following the priority indicated by documentation from step 1.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workload_source_type":{"type":"string"},"workload_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"workload_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"project_status_field":{"type":"string"},"current_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"excluded_status_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["workload_source_type","workload_tables","workload_fields","project_status_field","current_status_values","excluded_status_values"]}
  3. Locate the employee record for "Miroslav Kostić" in the employee table to obtain the exact employee_id needed for subsequent queries.
     Approach: Query the employee table using the provided name "Miroslav Kostić". First attempt an exact match on employee.name. If not found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (lowercasing and trimming whitespace on both sides, and checking if the normalized query is contained in employee.name), then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name strings, handling diacritics like 'ć' vs 'c', possible misspellings, or inverted name order such as 'Kostić Miroslav'). If there are multiple potential matches, choose the best one by highest fuzzy score; if ambiguity remains (for example, multiple near-identical matches with close scores), mark that multiple candidates exist instead of arbitrarily picking one. Do not access or use salary information from the employee table. Only retrieve non-sensitive fields necessary for identification (id, name, email, location, department).
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_list":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","matched_employee_name","match_confidence","multiple_candidates","candidate_list","found"]}
  4. Verify that the current user (Viola Messina, id SrwB_001) has permission to view another employee's workload across projects.
     Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and authorization check to retrieve the current user id, department, location, and system_roles (for example, 'Executive Leadership', 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin'). Using this information, and the company policy that executives can access any project and client information, determine if Viola is considered an executive (for example, department 'Corporate Leadership' or specific executive roles). Since only executives and the employee themselves can access sensitive data like salary, but workload and project membership are not salary fields, focus on verifying that there is no specific restriction on viewing allocation/workload across projects. If the policy evaluation shows that Viola is allowed to view project and workload information for other employees, set has_permission to true; otherwise, set has_permission to false. This step should not read or expose salary fields. The permission decision should consider the identified target employee_id from step 3. If no valid employee was found in step 3, set has_permission to false with an appropriate reason indicating missing target employee context.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"user_department":{"type":["string","null"]},"user_location":{"type":["string","null"]},"user_system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"target_employee_id_requested":{"type":["string","null"]},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","user_department","user_location","user_system_roles","target_employee_id_requested","has_permission","reason"]}
  5. Retrieve all "current" projects where the identified employee (Miroslav Kostić) is a team member, according to the technical and documentation definitions.
     Approach: Provided that step 3 found a unique employee_id and step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, query the team_member and project tables to find all rows where team_member.employee_id equals the matched_employee_id and the linked project.id matches team_member.project_id. Filter projects by the status values determined as "current" in step 1 and step 2 (for example, include only project.status in current_status_values and exclude project.status in excluded_status_values). Use exact equality filters on employee_id and project_id; for status values, use exact matches to the enumerated statuses ('idea', 'exploring', 'active', 'paused', 'archived'). If any project names or identifiers need to be checked for consistency, use partial and **FUZZY** matching only for display or auxiliary checks, but not to join tables. Return the list of all such project-team_member combinations, including project_id, project.name, project.status, team_member.role, and team_member.time_slice for each row.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"current_status_values_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"team_member_role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","team_member_role","time_slice"]}},"found_any_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","current_status_values_used","projects","found_any_projects"]}
  6. Compute Miroslav Kostić's workload across the retrieved current projects based on the selected workload source (for example, time_slice fractions).
     Approach: Using the project-team_member records from step 5 and the workload implementation choice from step 2 (for example, planned allocation via team_member.time_slice between 0.0 and 1.0), calculate the workload per project and in total. For each project, treat time_slice as the fraction of full-time allocation (for example, 0.50 means 50 percent of full-time). Sum all non-null time_slice values across all current projects to compute the total_allocation. If some time_slice values are null or missing, either treat them as 0.0 or flag them as unknown, following what step 1 and 2 indicated; in either case, report them explicitly. Optionally also compute basic statistics such as number_of_projects, minimum and maximum individual time_slice, and check if total_allocation exceeds 1.0 (indicating over-allocation) or is significantly below 1.0 (under-allocation). Do not log or persist any new data; just prepare these calculations for reporting.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"per_project_workload":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","project_status","time_slice"]}},"number_of_projects":{"type":"integer"},"total_allocation":{"type":["number","null"]},"has_missing_time_slices":{"type":"boolean"},"overallocated":{"type":"boolean"},"underallocated":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","per_project_workload","number_of_projects","total_allocation","has_missing_time_slices","overallocated","underallocated"]}
  7. Handle any blocking issues (no employee, no permission, or no implemented workload mechanism) and abort the task if necessary with a clear reason.
     Approach: Review the outputs of steps 1 through 6. If step 2 indicates that no suitable workload_source_type or required tables/fields were found (for example, workload_source_type is empty or refers to a non-existent table), or if the environment lacks the necessary functions or database access to perform the required queries, mark the functionality as not implemented and schedule an explicit abortion of the task with that reason. Similarly, if step 3 did not find a unique employee (found = false or multiple_candidates = true), or step 4 resulted in has_permission = false, or if other critical prerequisites failed (for example, fatal errors accessing tables), then do not attempt to fabricate results; instead, prepare an abort outcome describing which condition failed. If none of these blocking issues are present, this step will simply note that the plan can continue to final reporting using the computed workload from step 6.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"should_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":["string","null"]},"blocking_step":{"type":["integer","null"]}},"required":["should_abort","abort_reason","blocking_step"]}
