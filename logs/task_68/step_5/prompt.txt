Step 5: For every customer from the customer table, create or update a wiki_file entry with path 'customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md' and content exactly 'PLACEHOLDER' (no newline), ensuring a page exists for each customer.
Approach: For each customer record obtained in Step 3, construct the target wiki path as 'customers/' || customer.id || '.md'. For each such path, first check in the wiki_file table whether an entry with wiki_file.path equal to this constructed value already exists. Use exact matching on the path, and if necessary, use fuzzy or partial matching only to handle potential inconsistencies in stored paths, but prefer exact equality. If no entry exists, INSERT a new row into wiki_file with path equal to the constructed path and content equal to the literal string 'PLACEHOLDER' without a trailing newline. If an entry already exists, UPDATE its content field to 'PLACEHOLDER' (no newline) as required by the task. Ensure that no sensitive data is written to the wiki content. Repeat this process for all customers and record counts of created versus updated pages.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"total_customers":{"type":"integer"},"created_count":{"type":"integer"},"updated_count":{"type":"integer"},"processed_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["total_customers","created_count","updated_count","processed_paths"]}
