STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:42:56

Step 5 has been successfully executed and verified. I created wiki pages for all 21 customers in the format "customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md" with content exactly "PLACEHOLDER" (no newline). All pages were newly created (none existed previously), and each was verified to have the correct content. The operation was performed by Viola Messina (SrwB_001) from Corporate Leadership, who has the necessary permissions.

Key results:
- Total customers processed: 21
- New wiki pages created: 21
- Existing pages updated: 0
- All 21 wiki files were created in the "customers/" directory
- Each file contains exactly "PLACEHOLDER" with no newline
- The operation was audited with changed_by="SrwB_001"

Verification confirmed:
1. Current customer list has 21 customers
2. Exactly 21 wiki files exist in the customers/ directory
3. All customer IDs from the customer table have corresponding wiki files
4. All wiki files contain exactly "PLACEHOLDER" (no newline)
5. Counts match perfectly: 21 customers = 21 wiki files

The state-changing operation update_wiki() was called 21 times, once for each customer, and all calls returned success. All facts were verified through function returns: customer list from list_all_customers(), wiki files from list_wiki(), and content verification from load_wiki().
