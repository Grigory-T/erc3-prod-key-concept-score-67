Step 4: Verify that the current user (Viola Messina, id SrwB_001) has permission to create or update wiki files for customer pages in the wiki system.
Approach: Call the appropriate authorization or identity endpoint (for example, who_am_i() or an access control service) to obtain the current user identity, roles, department, and location, then evaluate these against the wiki system's access control rules. Specifically check whether a user from Corporate Leadership with id 'SrwB_001' is allowed to create or modify entries in the wiki_file storage for paths under 'customers/'. This step does not involve fuzzy search, as it relies on exact identity and role lookups once the current user and target system (Wiki) are known.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_edit_wiki":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","roles","can_edit_wiki","reason"]}
