I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the internal wiki for existing standards or templates related to customer wiki pages. Through multiple verification steps including fuzzy/semantic matching and detailed content examination of 19 wiki files, I can confirm:

1. **Fuzzy/semantic search executed**: Searched for terms including 'customer wiki pages', 'customer pages structure', 'CRM wiki templates' and related phrases across all wiki files.

2. **Detailed examination completed**: Loaded and examined content of key files (systems/crm.md, systems/knowledge_base.md, index.md, business/markets_and_customers.md) for any templates, guidelines, or constraints.

3. **Verification findings**:
   - **No existing 'customers/' directory**: No customer wiki pages currently exist in the wiki
   - **No files with 'template' in name**: No explicit template files found
   - **systems/crm.md contains the only relevant mention**: "Wiki pages may describe key accounts or reference successful case studies" - but provides no specific template
   - **No mandatory constraints found**: No specific requirements for structure, formatting, or content beyond the general wiki guidelines

The search confirms there are no existing templates or mandatory constraints for customer wiki pages. The company is starting fresh with this initiative, and the only guidance found is the general statement in systems/crm.md about wiki pages describing key accounts.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification.

  "guideline_found": true,
  "guideline_paths": ["systems/crm.md", "systems/knowledge_base.md", "index.md", "business/markets_and_customers.md"],
  "summary": "After thorough fuzzy/semantic search and verification of all 19 wiki files, found one relevant guideline in systems/crm.md stating 'Wiki pages may describe key accounts or reference successful case studies.' No specific templates, formats, or mandatory constraints for customer wiki pages were found. No existing 'customers/' directory or customer wiki page templates exist. The general wiki structure guidelines in systems/knowledge_base.md and index.md provide context but no customer-specific requirements. No mandatory constraints beyond the given requirement to use path format customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md and content 'PLACEHOLDER' were identified."
