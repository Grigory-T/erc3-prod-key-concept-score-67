DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:23:09
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed precisely as planned, confirming that there are no mandatory structural or template constraints for customer wiki pages aside from the task requirements. The findings do not contradict or require deviation from the original plan. All remaining steps are directly achievable as described and depend on independent checks (technical mechanism, customer list, permissions, and then the page creation). There is no indication that replanning or abort is required. The task can proceed exactly as designed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:29:49
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous steps were completed as expected and in alignment with the original plan. Step 1 confirmed no customer wiki template/constraint exists and Step 2 established the technical mechanism to create or update wiki pages works via the update_wiki API. There were no missing or unexpected results. The plan for further steps can proceed as written, specifically to retrieve customers, verify user permissions, and then create/update the wiki files. No replan is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:32:25
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been completed successfully and as planned, with outputs matching the expected results in the original plan. No issues or inconsistencies have been encountered. The next logical step is to proceed to Step 4, verifying the user's permission, followed by the final creation/update of the wiki files as described in Step 5. There is no reason to replan or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:37:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have been executed as planned with expected results: guidelines were checked (none restricting), technical mechanism (API) confirmed, customer list retrieved, and user permissions for wiki creation verified as sufficient. There are no discrepancies or blockers. The last step (5) is actionable per the original plan. Therefore, we should proceed to the next step as per plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:43:04
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed successfully according to the outlined requirements. There were no discrepancies or missing information; every step produced the expected outcomes, and task objectives were fully met. 21 customer wiki pages now exist, each with the required path and exact content ('PLACEHOLDER'). All company policies and rules were adhered to. No further steps remain.
