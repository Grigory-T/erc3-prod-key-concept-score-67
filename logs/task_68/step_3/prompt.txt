Step 3: Retrieve the complete list of customers and their identifiers from the customer table to know which CUSTOMER_ID values require a customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md wiki page.
Approach: Execute a SQL query against the customer table, such as SELECT id, name FROM customer, to obtain all existing customers. Since the task is to create pages for every customer, do not filter the result set. The retrieval is a direct table scan, so fuzzy or semantic search is not needed here, but ensure the table name 'customer' is matched exactly (if not, fall back on FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in database metadata for similarly named tables). The resulting list of customer identifiers will be used to construct wiki paths in the form 'customers/' || id || '.md'.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["customers"]}
