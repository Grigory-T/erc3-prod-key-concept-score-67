## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-08
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_001
User details: {"id": "SrwB_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** We are starting to create customer wiki pages. Create wiki pages in format customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md with content 'PLACEHOLDER' (no newline) for every customer

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Check internal wiki or company documentation for any existing standards or templates related to 'customer wiki pages' to ensure the pages under customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md follow any required structure or naming conventions.
Approach: Use the internal documentation or wiki search to look for terms such as 'customer wiki pages', 'customer pages structure', 'CRM wiki templates', and similar phrases. Because these terms may be ambiguous or use company-specific wording, perform the search using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching, including fuzzy matching for misspellings, synonyms, and plural/singular variations. Review any found guidelines to determine if there are mandatory constraints beyond the given requirement to use path format customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md and content 'PLACEHOLDER'.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"guideline_found":{"type":"boolean"},"guideline_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"summary":{"type":"string"}},"required":["guideline_found","guideline_paths","summary"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the internal wiki for existing standards or templates related to customer wiki pages. Through multiple verification steps including fuzzy/semantic matching and detailed content examination of 19 wiki files, I can confirm:

1. **Fuzzy/semantic search executed**: Searched for terms including 'customer wiki pages', 'customer pages structure', 'CRM wiki templates' and related phrases across all wiki files.

2. **Detailed examination completed**: Loaded and examined content of key files (systems/crm.md, systems/knowledge_base.md, index.md, business/markets_and_customers.md) for any templates, guidelines, or constraints.

3. **Verification findings**:
   - **No existing 'customers/' directory**: No customer wiki pages currently exist in the wiki
   - **No files with 'template' in name**: No explicit template files found
   - **systems/crm.md contains the only relevant mention**: "Wiki pages may describe key accounts or reference successful case studies" - but provides no specific template
   - **No mandatory constraints found**: No specific requirements for structure, formatting, or content beyond the general wiki guidelines

The search confirms there are no existing templates or mandatory constraints for customer wiki pages. The company is starting fresh with this initiative, and the only guidance found is the general statement in systems/crm.md about wiki pages describing key accounts.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification.

{
  "guideline_found": true,
  "guideline_paths": ["systems/crm.md", "systems/knowledge_base.md", "index.md", "business/markets_and_customers.md"],
  "summary": "After thorough fuzzy/semantic search and verification of all 19 wiki files, found one relevant guideline in systems/crm.md stating 'Wiki pages may describe key accounts or reference successful case studies.' No specific templates, formats, or mandatory constraints for customer wiki pages were found. No existing 'customers/' directory or customer wiki page templates exist. The general wiki structure guidelines in systems/knowledge_base.md and index.md provide context but no customer-specific requirements. No mandatory constraints beyond the given requirement to use path format customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md and content 'PLACEHOLDER' were identified."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the concrete technical mechanism (tables, APIs, or services) used to store and modify wiki pages so that customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md files can be created with content.
Approach: Inspect available system documentation, database schema, or service catalogs to locate the implementation of the wiki. Specifically, search for entities like 'wiki', 'wiki_file', 'markdown pages', or 'content repository'. Use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle possible naming differences or abbreviations (for example, 'wk_file', 'wiki-files'). Confirm that the wiki_file table is the authoritative storage for wiki pages, and note its relevant fields (such as path and content) needed to create entries for customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md with content 'PLACEHOLDER'.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"wiki_system_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_type":{"type":"string"},"wiki_table_name":{"type":"string"},"wiki_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["wiki_system_found","storage_type","wiki_table_name","wiki_fields"]}

I'll execute Step 2 to identify the technical mechanism for storing and modifying wiki pages by examining available system functions and searching the wiki for documentation.

# Chatbot Interface

The **chatbot** is a modern, conversational interface that sits on top of Bellini’s legacy systems (CRM, project registry, employee registry, time tracking and wiki). It allows employees to **ask questions in natural language** and, in some cases, perform simple actions.

## What the chatbot can do

- Answer questions about:
  - Customers and their status.
  - Projects, teams and workloads.
  - Employees, departments, skills and locations.
  - Time tracking summaries for emp

# CRM – Customer & Deal Tracking

The **CRM (Customer Relationship Management)** system is the central repository for **customer master data** and **high‑level opportunity tracking**.

## What is stored in the CRM?

For each **customer company**:

- Customer ID (internal)
- Name and legal form
- Main address and country
- Industry segment (e.g. Rail, Food & Beverage, General Industry)
- Primary contact name and email
- Assigned account manager (employee ID)
- Short descriptive **brief**
- Curren

--- Content of systems/employee_registry.md (first 500 chars) ---
# Employee Registry

The **employee registry** is the authoritative source for information about **people** at Bellini Coatings.

## What is stored in the employee registry?

For each employee:

- Employee ID (internal unique identifier)
- Full name
- Auto‑generated email address
- Salary (confidential)
- Free‑text notes (HR/internal use)
- Location (e.g. “HQ – Italy”, “Serbian Plant”, “Munich Office”)
- Department (one of the standard departments)
- Skills (list of `SkillLevel` entries)
- Wills

--- Content of systems/knowledge_base.md (first 500 chars) ---
# Knowledge Base / Wiki

The **knowledge base** (this wiki) is the central place for **processes, guidelines, technical notes and reference information** at Bellini Coatings.

## Purpose

- Preserve and share **know‑how** across locations and generations.
- Provide clear **process descriptions** for onboarding and daily work.
- Document **approved solutions**, best practices and lessons learned.
- Serve as a key source of context for the **chatbot**.

## Content types

Typical content includes:

# Systems Overview

Bellini Coatings runs its core business on a set of **legacy but robust systems** built on **Progress OpenEdge** more than 30 years ago. These systems are centralised at HQ and accessed from Italy, Serbia and all EU branches.

The main systems visible to most employees are:

- **CRM – Customer Relationship Management**
- **Project Registry**
- **Employee Registry (including skills & wills)**
- **Time Tracking / Timesheets**
- **Knowledge Base / Wiki**

=== Analyzing available wiki functions ===
Available wiki functions:
1. list_wiki() -> list[str]
2. load_wiki(file_path: str) -> str | None
3. search_wiki(query_regex: str) -> list[dict]
4. update_wiki(file_path, content, changed_by=None) -> bool

These functions suggest:
- Wiki pages are stored with file paths (string identifiers)
- Content is stored as text/markdown
- There's a backend storage system (database or file system)
- The update_wiki function accepts changed_by parameter for audit

=== Inference from available information ===
From the function signatures and typical system architecture:
1. The wiki appears to use a file-based abstraction
2. Each wiki page has a unique path (e.g., 'systems/crm.md')
3. Content is stored as text (markdown format)
4. The backend likely uses a database table (e.g., 'wiki_files' or 'wiki_pages')
5. Common fields would include: path, content, created_at, updated_at, changed_by

Based on my thorough examination of the wiki system and available documentation, I can now provide the findings for Step 2.

<final_answer>
After conducting a comprehensive search of the wiki system documentation and available functions, I have identified the technical mechanism for storing and modifying wiki pages. Here are the key findings:

1. **Search Methodology Applied**: I performed multiple search approaches including:
   - Examining all 19 wiki files in the system
   - Using fuzzy and semantic matching for technical terms
   - Detailed content analysis of system documentation files
   - Searching for database schema, API documentation, and technical implementation details

2. **Available Functions Identified**: The system provides four primary functions for wiki interaction:
   - `list_wiki()` → Returns list of file paths
   - `load_wiki(file_path)` → Returns content of a specific file
   - `search_wiki(query_regex)` → Searches content using regular expressions
   - `update_wiki(file_path, content, changed_by=None)` → Creates/updates wiki pages

3. **Technical Infrastructure Discovered**:
   - The wiki is part of Bellini's legacy systems built on **Progress OpenEdge** (30+ years old)
   - Systems are centralized at HQ and accessed from all locations
   - The chatbot interface sits on top of these legacy systems including the wiki
   - The IT & Digital team maintains the technical infrastructure

4. **Storage Mechanism Inference**: Based on the available evidence:
   - Storage is database-based (Progress OpenEdge)
   - The exact table name is not documented in the wiki
   - The `update_wiki` function signature provides clues about required fields
   - Typical wiki systems use tables like `wiki_files`, `wiki_pages`, or `content_pages`

5. **Critical Finding**: Despite thorough searching, **no explicit database schema documentation** was found in the wiki. The documentation focuses on usage guidelines and system purposes rather than technical implementation details.

No state-changing operations were performed during this investigation.

{
  "wiki_system_found": true,
  "storage_type": "Database (Progress OpenEdge legacy system)",

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical mechanism (tables, APIs, or services) used to store and modify wiki pages so that customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md files can be created with content.
Approach: Inspect available system documentation, database schema, or service catalogs to locate the implementation of the wiki. Specifically, search for entities like 'wiki', 'wiki_file', 'markdown pages', or 'content repository'. Use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search to handle possible naming differences or abbreviations (for example, 'wk_file', 'wiki-files'). Confirm that the wiki_file table is the authoritative storage for wiki pages, and note its relevant fields (such as path and content) needed to create entries for customers/CUSTOMER_ID.md with content 'PLACEHOLDER'.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"wiki_system_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_type":{"type":"string"},"wiki_table_name":{"type":"string"},"wiki_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["wiki_system_found","storage_type","wiki_table_name","wiki_fields"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

The **knowledge base** (this wiki) is the central place for **processes, guidelines, technical notes and reference information** at Bellini Coatings.


  Line 36:
  
- Each section of the wiki has **content owners** (e.g. HR for HR pages, IT for systems pages, R&D for technical guidelines).
- Updates are coordinated via these owners to ensure consistency (top execs have full control).

  Line 39:
  - To delete a page - zero out its content. To rename - transfer content to new location and zero out old page.
- The IT & Digital team maintains the **technical infrastructure** and integrates the wiki with the chatbot.

  Line 18:
  2. **Stability over novelty**
   - The core systems are old but extremely stable. We minimise risky changes.
3. **Progressive modernisation**

  Line 41:
  - The **wiki** stores process documentation, guidelines, case studies and reference material.
- The **chatbot** reads from and writes to these systems via APIs and uses the wiki for context and explanations.

  Line 55:
  - **Customer supply projects**
  - Ongoing contracts where time is logged for support and technical visits.

  Line 100:
  * **Resource planning:** Department leads and project managers identify overload situations early.
* **Staffing decisions:** R&D, Sales, and Technical Service use workload figures to decide who can be assigned to new initiatives.
* **Chatbot queries:** The chatbot can answer questions such as “Who is overloaded?” or “What is Sara Romano’s workload across current projects?” by directly aggregating `TimeSlice` values from the project registry.

<final_answer>
After conducting exhaustive targeted searches for technical documentation, I can confirm the following findings:

1. **Complete Search Executed**: I performed multiple targeted searches including:
   - Exact matching for table names: 'wiki_file', 'wiki_files', 'wiki_table', 'wiki_page', 'wiki_pages', 'content_repository', 'markdown_pages', 'wk_file', 'wiki-files'
   - Database schema pattern searches: 'CREATE TABLE', 'DROP TABLE', 'ALTER TABLE', 'database schema'
   - API documentation searches: 'API documentation', 'endpoint', 'REST', 'SOAP', 'web service'
   - Technical specification file searches
   - Chatbot-wiki integration details

2. **Verification Results**:
   - **No table names found**: None of the searched table names exist in wiki documentation
   - **No database schema documentation found**: No CREATE TABLE statements or schema definitions exist in the wiki
   - **No API documentation found**: No API endpoint specifications, REST/SOAP documentation, or technical interface specifications
   - **No technical specification files found**: No files with 'spec', 'technical', 'api', 'schema', or 'design' in their names

3. **Concrete Technical Mechanism Identified**:
   - The **`update_wiki(file_path, content, changed_by=None)`** function is the concrete API for creating and modifying wiki pages
   - This function accepts `file_path` (string) and `content` (string) as required parameters
   - The `changed_by` parameter is optional for audit purposes
   - This function returns a boolean indicating success/failure

4. **Evidence from System Documentation**:
   - The `update_wiki` function signature confirms the required fields for creating wiki entries
   - Testing confirmed that non-existent files return `None` when loaded with `load_wiki()`
   - Existing wiki files have simple markdown structure without YAML frontmatter or metadata
   - The chatbot interface documentation confirms the wiki is accessed via APIs

No state-changing operations were performed during this investigation.
