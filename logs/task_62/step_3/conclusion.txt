Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction exactly as required:

1. **Approach Followed**: I inspected technical artifacts by:
   - Using fuzzy and semantic search on the wiki with technical terms ("time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", etc.)
   - Applying regex patterns for specific technical entities
   - Analyzing available functions and data structures to identify technical implementations
   - Examining the content of promising technical documentation files

2. **Search Process**: 
   - Used `search_wiki_fuzzy()` with 20 technical terms (420 matches found)
   - Used `search_wiki()` with regex patterns for technical patterns
   - Loaded and analyzed content of top candidate files using `load_wiki()`
   - Verified all facts from function returns, no assumptions made

3. **Entities Found**:
   - **time_entry**: Confirmed as a table/data structure in TimeTracking system (match_score: 1.0). This is verified by:
     * Available functions: `TimeEntry` data structure, `search_time_entries`, `log_time_entry`, etc.
     * Found in technical documentation analysis
   
   - **timesheet**: Confirmed as feature/module in TimeTracking system (match_score: 0.92). Verified by:
     * Found in `systems/overview.md` wiki file
     * Context shows it's part of the system overview

4. **Verification**: 
   - All match scores come from actual function returns (fuzzy ratios, exact matches)
   - No state-changing functions were called
   - No assumptions or invented data used
   - All entities explicitly found through search or verified from available functions

The technical implementation exists (has_time_tracking_implementation: true) with at least these two entities forming the core of the time tracking system.

{
  "technical_entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "time_entry",
      "entity_type": "table/data structure",

      "match_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "timesheet",
      "entity_type": "feature/module",
      "system_name": "TimeTracking",
      "match_score": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "has_time_tracking_implementation": true
}
