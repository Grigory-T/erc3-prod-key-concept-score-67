Step 3: Search for related technical implementation of time tracking in company systems (for example, database tables or services that implement time tracking) using fuzzy and semantic or logical search for relevant entities.
Approach: Inspect the known technical artifacts (such as the SQL schema and any available service registry or internal developer documentation) to find entities and services that implement time tracking. Specifically, look for tables and services whose names or descriptions indicate time logging, such as the time_entry table and any TimeTracking service. Use a fuzzy and semantic or logical search to match on terms like "time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", and similar variations or misspellings. Confirm that the identified technical implementation (for example, the time_entry table in the TimeTracking system) is what the wiki documentation likely refers to when explaining how time tracking works. If no technical implementation objects can be found at all, mark that fact so that the overall task could be aborted due to missing implementation, but only if this completely prevents answering the user’s question.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"technical_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "entity_type": {"type": "string"}, "system_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["entity_name", "entity_type", "system_name"]}}, "has_time_tracking_implementation": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["technical_entities", "has_time_tracking_implementation"]}
