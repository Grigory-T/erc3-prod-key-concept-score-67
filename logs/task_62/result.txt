Message: You can read about how time tracking works in the wiki file: 'systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md'.

Main reasons we track time at Bellini:
- To understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects, and internal activities.
- To enable accurate billing, customer reporting, and calculating billable vs non-billable work.
- For project tracking and analysis, resource planning, and operational reporting.
- To support compliance, workload review, and audit trails through the approval system.

See: systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md in the company wiki for a detailed description of the process and rationale.
