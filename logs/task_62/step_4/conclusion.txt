STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:12:55

I have successfully executed Step 4 as instructed. I selected the most relevant wiki file "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" based on the candidate_wiki_files list with highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms. I loaded its full content (2,931 characters) and parsed it to identify three process description sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works:

1. **Overview section** ("# Time Tracking & Reporting"): Describes the central time tracking system, its purpose, and who is required to use it.
2. **Structure section** ("## Time entry structure"): Details all fields employees must fill when creating time entries (employee ID, customer, project, date, hours, work category, notes, billable flag, and status).
3. **Workflow section** ("## Lifecycle of time entries"): Explains the submission and approval workflow with the five statuses (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) and the correction process.

These sections collectively describe how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, and the submission and approval workflow. No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions.

    "# Time Tracking & Reporting\n\nBellini Coatings uses a central **time tracking system** to understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects and internal activities.\n\nMost non‑production employees (and selected production roles) are required to log time regularly.",
    "## Time entry structure\n\nEach time entry contains:\n\n- Employee (employee ID)\n- Customer (optional, usually derived from project)\n- Project (project ID, customer or internal)\n- Date (YYYY‑MM‑DD)\n- Hours (decimal, e.g. 1.0, 7.5)\n- Work category (e.g. `customer_project`, `internal`, `support`, `admin`)\n- Notes (short free text)\n- Billable flag (billable vs non‑billable)\n- Status:\n  - `draft`\n  - `submitted`\n  - `approved`\n  - `invoiced`\n  - `voided`",
    "## Lifecycle of time entries\n\n1. **Draft**\n   - Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed.\n2. **Submitted**\n   - Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month).\n3. **Approved**\n   - Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency.\n4. **Invoiced**\n   - Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked.\n5. **Voided**\n   - Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry.\n\nAfter approval, employees cannot change entries directly; corrections require specific processes to ensure an audit trail."
