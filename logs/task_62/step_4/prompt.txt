Step 4: Select the most relevant wiki file that explains how time tracking works and read its content to identify process details.
Approach: From the candidate_wiki_files list, choose the wiki file with the highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms (for example, a path like "processes/time_tracking.md" or "operations/timesheets/how_time_tracking_works.md"). Use deterministic tie-breaking rules if needed (for example, prefer files under a processes or operations folder over others). Retrieve the full content field from the wiki_file record for that selected path. Parse the content to locate sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works (for example, how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, submission and approval workflow, and any references to time_entry or TimeTracking systems). This step focuses only on understanding and extracting the "how it works" procedural or functional description.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"selected_wiki_path": {"type": "string"}, "wiki_title": {"type": "string"}, "process_description_sections": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["selected_wiki_path", "process_description_sections"]}
