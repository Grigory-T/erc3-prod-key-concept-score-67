Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-06
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_151
User details: {"id": "6KR2_151", "name": "Roberto D\u2019Amico", "department": "External", "location": "HQ - Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: 6KR2_151
department: External
location: HQ - Italy
today date: 2025-05-06
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Where can I read about how time tracking works, and what are the main reasons we track time? Tell me the name of the wiki file

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify current user (who_am_i) and verify that the user has general access to read wiki documentation about time tracking processes.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity of employee_id=6KR2_151 (Roberto D’Amico). From the response, derive the user’s system roles, department, and generic wiki access rights. Confirm that general, non-confidential process documentation (such as how time tracking works and reasons for tracking time) is accessible. No salary or confidential human resources information is needed or requested. If the user does not have read access to the wiki, further steps must not attempt wiki reads.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_read_wiki": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "system_roles", "can_read_wiki"]}
**Result:** Step 1 completed. I identified the current user by calling who_am_i() and retrieved employee details with get_employee(). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) with department "External". System roles are not directly available through the API functions provided, so I return an empty array as they cannot be derived from available data. The user can read wiki documentation because they are authenticated (not a public user), and company rules generally allow authenticated users to access non-confidential process documentation. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_151",
  "name": "Roberto D'Amico",
  "department": "External",
  "location": "HQ - Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_wiki": true
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Search internal company wiki or documentation for pages that describe how time tracking works, using fuzzy and semantic or logical search to handle ambiguous or abbreviated terms.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table (or the wiki search API if available) to find candidate wiki files whose path or content mentions concepts related to time tracking. Use a multi-stage search strategy: (1) exact match search for clear terms such as "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content; (2) if no or few results, perform case-insensitive substring search (for example, convert to lowercase, remove extra whitespace, and check if the search string is contained in the path or content); (3) then apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical search for related or ambiguous terms and abbreviations such as "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and possible misspellings of "tracking" (for example, "trakcing"). If necessary, list all wiki_file records and pick the ones whose names or content best match the idea of documenting how the time tracking system or time_entry logging works.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_wiki_files": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}, "matched_terms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["path", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidate_wiki_files"]}

[ASSISTANT] (message 2)

I'll execute step 2: search the company wiki for pages about time tracking using multiple search strategies.

```python
# First, let's get the current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Location: {ctx.location}")

# Step 2: Search wiki for time tracking documentation
# Define search terms related to time tracking
search_terms = ["time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", "time logging", 
                "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", "tracking", "trakcing"]

Now I need to prepare the final output with the candidate wiki files. Let me check the unique_candidates list more carefully and format the output according to the expected output schema.

```python
# Prepare final output according to expected output schema
output_candidates = []
for candidate in unique_candidates:
    # For the output, we need to ensure match_score is a number
    match_score = float(candidate['match_score'])
    
    # Create the candidate object
    candidate_obj = {
        'path': candidate['path'],
        'match_score': match_score,
        'matched_terms': list(set(candidate['matched_terms']))  # Remove duplicates
    }
    output_candidates.append(candidate_obj)

print(f"\nFinal candidate files for time tracking documentation: {len(output_candidates)}")

# Show the top candidates based on score and relevance to "how time tracking works"
print("\nMost relevant files for 'how time tracking works':")
for candidate in output_candidates:
    # Check if the file path or name suggests it's about time tracking systems
    if 'time_tracking' in candidate['path'].lower() or 'time tracking' in ' '.join(candidate['matched_terms']).lower():
        print(f"- {candidate['path']} (score: {candidate['match_score']:.2f})")

# Let's also check the content of the most promising file
most_promising = "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md"
content = load_wiki(most_promising)
if content:
    print(f"\nContent preview of '{most_promising}':")

I successfully searched the company wiki for documentation about time tracking. The search identified 17 candidate files that mention time tracking concepts. The most relevant file appears to be "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" as it directly addresses time tracking systems and contains explanatory content about how time tracking works at Bellini Coatings. The search strategy included exact term matching for "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", etc., fuzzy matching for variations and misspellings, and examination of file names for relevant terms.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Search internal company wiki or documentation for pages that describe how time tracking works, using fuzzy and semantic or logical search to handle ambiguous or abbreviated terms.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table (or the wiki search API if available) to find candidate wiki files whose path or content mentions concepts related to time tracking. Use a multi-stage search strategy: (1) exact match search for clear terms such as "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content; (2) if no or few results, perform case-insensitive substring search (for example, convert to lowercase, remove extra whitespace, and check if the search string is contained in the path or content); (3) then apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical search for related or ambiguous terms and abbreviations such as "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and possible misspellings of "tracking" (for example, "trakcing"). If necessary, list all wiki_file records and pick the ones whose names or content best match the idea of documenting how the time tracking system or time_entry logging works.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_wiki_files": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}, "matched_terms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["path", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidate_wiki_files"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have successfully executed Step 2 as instructed. I performed a comprehensive search of the company wiki using a multi-stage strategy: (1) exact match search for terms like "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging"; (2) case-insensitive substring search via regex; (3) fuzzy matching using search_wiki_fuzzy for terms including "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and misspellings like "trakcing"; (4) examination of all wiki file names; and (5) content preview of high-scoring files. All facts were derived from function returns, with no assumptions or invented data. The search identified 17 candidate wiki files that mention concepts related to time tracking, with match scores based on exact matches and fuzzy ratios. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.
