Step 1: Identify current user (who_am_i) and verify that the user has general access to read wiki documentation about time tracking processes.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity of employee_id=6KR2_151 (Roberto D’Amico). From the response, derive the user’s system roles, department, and generic wiki access rights. Confirm that general, non-confidential process documentation (such as how time tracking works and reasons for tracking time) is accessible. No salary or confidential human resources information is needed or requested. If the user does not have read access to the wiki, further steps must not attempt wiki reads.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_read_wiki": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "system_roles", "can_read_wiki"]}
