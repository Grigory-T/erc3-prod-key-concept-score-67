Step 1 completed. I identified the current user by calling who_am_i() and retrieved employee details with get_employee(). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) with department "External". System roles are not directly available through the API functions provided, so I return an empty array as they cannot be derived from available data. The user can read wiki documentation because they are authenticated (not a public user), and company rules generally allow authenticated users to access non-confidential process documentation. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_151",
  "name": "Roberto D'Amico",
  "department": "External",
  "location": "HQ - Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_wiki": true
}
