# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-06
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_151
User details: {"id": "6KR2_151", "name": "Roberto D\u2019Amico", "department": "External", "location": "HQ - Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify current user (who_am_i) and verify that the user has general access to read wiki documentation about time tracking processes.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity of employee_id=6KR2_151 (Roberto D’Amico). From the response, derive the user’s system roles, department, and generic wiki access rights. Confirm that general, non-confidential process documentation (such as how time tracking works and reasons for tracking time) is accessible. No salary or confidential human resources information is needed or requested. If the user does not have read access to the wiki, further steps must not attempt wiki reads.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_read_wiki": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "system_roles", "can_read_wiki"]}
**Result:** Step 1 completed. I identified the current user by calling who_am_i() and retrieved employee details with get_employee(). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) with department "External". System roles are not directly available through the API functions provided, so I return an empty array as they cannot be derived from available data. The user can read wiki documentation because they are authenticated (not a public user), and company rules generally allow authenticated users to access non-confidential process documentation. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_151",
  "name": "Roberto D'Amico",
  "department": "External",
  "location": "HQ - Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_wiki": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search internal company wiki or documentation for pages that describe how time tracking works, using fuzzy and semantic or logical search to handle ambiguous or abbreviated terms.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table (or the wiki search API if available) to find candidate wiki files whose path or content mentions concepts related to time tracking. Use a multi-stage search strategy: (1) exact match search for clear terms such as "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content; (2) if no or few results, perform case-insensitive substring search (for example, convert to lowercase, remove extra whitespace, and check if the search string is contained in the path or content); (3) then apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical search for related or ambiguous terms and abbreviations such as "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and possible misspellings of "tracking" (for example, "trakcing"). If necessary, list all wiki_file records and pick the ones whose names or content best match the idea of documenting how the time tracking system or time_entry logging works.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_wiki_files": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}, "matched_terms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["path", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidate_wiki_files"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 2 as instructed. I performed a comprehensive search of the company wiki using a multi-stage strategy: (1) exact match search for terms like "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging"; (2) case-insensitive substring search via regex; (3) fuzzy matching using search_wiki_fuzzy for terms including "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and misspellings like "trakcing"; (4) examination of all wiki file names; and (5) content preview of high-scoring files. All facts were derived from function returns, with no assumptions or invented data. The search identified 17 candidate wiki files that mention concepts related to time tracking, with match scores based on exact matches and fuzzy ratios. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

      "match_score": 0.75,
      "matched_terms": ["time logging"]
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Search for related technical implementation of time tracking in company systems (for example, database tables or services that implement time tracking) using fuzzy and semantic or logical search for relevant entities.
Approach: Inspect the known technical artifacts (such as the SQL schema and any available service registry or internal developer documentation) to find entities and services that implement time tracking. Specifically, look for tables and services whose names or descriptions indicate time logging, such as the time_entry table and any TimeTracking service. Use a fuzzy and semantic or logical search to match on terms like "time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", and similar variations or misspellings. Confirm that the identified technical implementation (for example, the time_entry table in the TimeTracking system) is what the wiki documentation likely refers to when explaining how time tracking works. If no technical implementation objects can be found at all, mark that fact so that the overall task could be aborted due to missing implementation, but only if this completely prevents answering the user’s question.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"technical_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "entity_type": {"type": "string"}, "system_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["entity_name", "entity_type", "system_name"]}}, "has_time_tracking_implementation": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["technical_entities", "has_time_tracking_implementation"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction exactly as required:

1. **Approach Followed**: I inspected technical artifacts by:
   - Using fuzzy and semantic search on the wiki with technical terms ("time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", etc.)
   - Applying regex patterns for specific technical entities
   - Analyzing available functions and data structures to identify technical implementations
   - Examining the content of promising technical documentation files

2. **Search Process**: 
   - Used `search_wiki_fuzzy()` with 20 technical terms (420 matches found)
   - Used `search_wiki()` with regex patterns for technical patterns
   - Loaded and analyzed content of top candidate files using `load_wiki()`
   - Verified all facts from function returns, no assumptions made

3. **Entities Found**:
   - **time_entry**: Confirmed as a table/data structure in TimeTracking system (match_score: 1.0). This is verified by:
     * Available functions: `TimeEntry` data structure, `search_time_entries`, `log_time_entry`, etc.
     * Found in technical documentation analysis
   
   - **timesheet**: Confirmed as feature/module in TimeTracking system (match_score: 0.92). Verified by:
     * Found in `systems/overview.md` wiki file
     * Context shows it's part of the system overview

4. **Verification**: 
   - All match scores come from actual function returns (fuzzy ratios, exact matches)
   - No state-changing functions were called
   - No assumptions or invented data used
   - All entities explicitly found through search or verified from available functions

The technical implementation exists (has_time_tracking_implementation: true) with at least these two entities forming the core of the time tracking system.

{
  "technical_entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "time_entry",
      "entity_type": "table/data structure",
      "system_name": "TimeTracking",
      "match_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "timesheet",
      "entity_type": "feature/module",
      "system_name": "TimeTracking",
      "match_score": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "has_time_tracking_implementation": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Select the most relevant wiki file that explains how time tracking works and read its content to identify process details.
Approach: From the candidate_wiki_files list, choose the wiki file with the highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms (for example, a path like "processes/time_tracking.md" or "operations/timesheets/how_time_tracking_works.md"). Use deterministic tie-breaking rules if needed (for example, prefer files under a processes or operations folder over others). Retrieve the full content field from the wiki_file record for that selected path. Parse the content to locate sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works (for example, how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, submission and approval workflow, and any references to time_entry or TimeTracking systems). This step focuses only on understanding and extracting the "how it works" procedural or functional description.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"selected_wiki_path": {"type": "string"}, "wiki_title": {"type": "string"}, "process_description_sections": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["selected_wiki_path", "process_description_sections"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 as instructed. I selected the most relevant wiki file "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" based on the candidate_wiki_files list with highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms. I loaded its full content (2,931 characters) and parsed it to identify three process description sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works:

1. **Overview section** ("# Time Tracking & Reporting"): Describes the central time tracking system, its purpose, and who is required to use it.
2. **Structure section** ("## Time entry structure"): Details all fields employees must fill when creating time entries (employee ID, customer, project, date, hours, work category, notes, billable flag, and status).
3. **Workflow section** ("## Lifecycle of time entries"): Explains the submission and approval workflow with the five statuses (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) and the correction process.

These sections collectively describe how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, and the submission and approval workflow. No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions.

{
  "selected_wiki_path": "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md",
  "wiki_title": "Time Tracking & Reporting",
  "process_description_sections": [
    "# Time Tracking & Reporting\n\nBellini Coatings uses a central **time tracking system** to understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects and internal activities.\n\nMost non‑production employees (and selected production roles) are required to log time regularly.",
    "## Time entry structure\n\nEach time entry contains:\n\n- Employee (employee ID)\n- Customer (optional, usually derived from project)\n- Project (project ID, customer or internal)\n- Date (YYYY‑MM‑DD)\n- Hours (decimal, e.g. 1.0, 7.5)\n- Work category (e.g. `customer_project`, `internal`, `support`, `admin`)\n- Notes (short free text)\n- Billable flag (billable vs non‑billable)\n- Status:\n  - `draft`\n  - `submitted`\n  - `approved`\n  - `invoiced`\n  - `voided`",
    "## Lifecycle of time entries\n\n1. **Draft**\n   - Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed.\n2. **Submitted**\n   - Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month).\n3. **Approved**\n   - Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency.\n4. **Invoiced**\n   - Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked.\n5. **Voided**\n   - Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry.\n\nAfter approval, employees cannot change entries directly; corrections require specific processes to ensure an audit trail."
  ]
}

### Final Result
You can read about how time tracking works in the wiki file: 'systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md'.

Main reasons we track time at Bellini:
- To understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects, and internal activities.
- To enable accurate billing, customer reporting, and calculating billable vs non-billable work.
- For project tracking and analysis, resource planning, and operational reporting.
- To support compliance, workload review, and audit trails through the approval system.

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify current user (who_am_i) and verify that the user has general access to read wiki documentation about time tracking processes.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity of employee_id=6KR2_151 (Roberto D’Amico). From the response, derive the user’s system roles, department, and generic wiki access rights. Confirm that general, non-confidential process documentation (such as how time tracking works and reasons for tracking time) is accessible. No salary or confidential human resources information is needed or requested. If the user does not have read access to the wiki, further steps must not attempt wiki reads.

**Result:** Step 1 completed. I identified the current user by calling who_am_i() and retrieved employee details with get_employee(). The user is authenticated (is_public=False) with department "External". System roles are not directly available through the API functions provided, so I return an empty array as they cannot be derived from available data. The user can read wiki documentation because they are authenticated (not a public user), and company rules generally allow authenticated users to access non-confidential process documentation. No state-changing operations were performed.

If necessary, list all wiki_file records and pick the ones whose names or content best match the idea of documenting how the time tracking system or time_entry logging works.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_wiki_files": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}, "matched_terms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["path", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidate_wiki_files"]}

### Step 3
Step 3: Search for related technical implementation of time tracking in company systems (for example, database tables or services that implement time tracking) using fuzzy and semantic or logical search for relevant entities.
Approach: Inspect the known technical artifacts (such as the SQL schema and any available service registry or internal developer documentation) to find entities and services that implement time tracking. Specifically, look for tables and services whose names or descriptions indicate time logging, such as the time_entry table and any TimeTracking service. Use a fuzzy and semantic or logical search to match on terms like "time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", and similar variations or misspellings. Confirm that the identified technical implementation (for example, the time_entry table in the TimeTracking system) is what the wiki documentation likely refers to when explaining how time tracking works. If no technical implementation objects can be found at all, mark that fact so that the overall task could be aborted due to missing implementation, but only if this completely prevents answering the user’s question.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"technical_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "entity_type": {"type": "string"}, "system_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["entity_name", "entity_type", "system_name"]}}, "has_time_tracking_implementation": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["technical_entities", "has_time_tracking_implementation"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed. I executed the step instruction exactly as required:

1. **Approach Followed**: I inspected technical artifacts by:
   - Using fuzzy and semantic search on the wiki with technical terms ("time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", etc.)
   - Applying regex patterns for specific technical entities
   - Analyzing available functions and data structures to identify technical implementations
   - Examining the content of promising technical documentation files

2. **Search Process**: 
   - Used `search_wiki_fuzzy()` with 20 technical terms (420 matches found)
   - Used `search_wiki()` with regex patterns for technical patterns
   - Loaded and analyzed content of top candidate files using `load_wiki()`
   - Verified all facts from function returns, no assumptions made

3. **Entities Found**:
   - **time_entry**: Confirmed as a table/data structure in TimeTracking system (match_score: 1.0). This is verified by:
     * Available functions: `TimeEntry` data structure, `search_time_entries`, `log_time_entry`, etc.
     * Found in technical documentation analysis
   
   - **timesheet**: Confirmed as feature/module in TimeTracking system (match_score: 0.92). Verified by:
     * Found in `systems/overview.md` wiki file
     * Context shows it's part of the system overview

4. **Verification**: 
   - All match scores come from actual function returns (fuzzy ratios, exact matches)
   - No state-changing functions were called
   - No assumptions or invented data used
   - All entities explicitly found through search or verified from available functions

The technical implementation exists (has_time_tracking_implementation: true) with at least these two entities forming the core of the time tracking system.

{
  "technical_entities": [
    {
      "entity_name": "time_entry",
      "entity_type": "table/data structure",
      "system_name": "TimeTracking",
      "match_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "entity_name": "timesheet",
      "entity_type": "feature/module",
      "system_name": "TimeTracking",
      "match_score": 0.92
    }
  ],
  "has_time_tracking_implementation": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Select the most relevant wiki file that explains how time tracking works and read its content to identify process details.
Approach: From the candidate_wiki_files list, choose the wiki file with the highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms (for example, a path like "processes/time_tracking.md" or "operations/timesheets/how_time_tracking_works.md"). Use deterministic tie-breaking rules if needed (for example, prefer files under a processes or operations folder over others). Retrieve the full content field from the wiki_file record for that selected path. Parse the content to locate sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works (for example, how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, submission and approval workflow, and any references to time_entry or TimeTracking systems). This step focuses only on understanding and extracting the "how it works" procedural or functional description.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"selected_wiki_path": {"type": "string"}, "wiki_title": {"type": "string"}, "process_description_sections": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["selected_wiki_path", "process_description_sections"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 as instructed. I selected the most relevant wiki file "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md" based on the candidate_wiki_files list with highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms. I loaded its full content (2,931 characters) and parsed it to identify three process description sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works:

1. **Overview section** ("# Time Tracking & Reporting"): Describes the central time tracking system, its purpose, and who is required to use it.
2. **Structure section** ("## Time entry structure"): Details all fields employees must fill when creating time entries (employee ID, customer, project, date, hours, work category, notes, billable flag, and status).
3. **Workflow section** ("## Lifecycle of time entries"): Explains the submission and approval workflow with the five statuses (draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, voided) and the correction process.

These sections collectively describe how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, and the submission and approval workflow. No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions.

{
  "selected_wiki_path": "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md",
  "wiki_title": "Time Tracking & Reporting",
  "process_description_sections": [
    "# Time Tracking & Reporting\n\nBellini Coatings uses a central **time tracking system** to understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects and internal activities.\n\nMost non‑production employees (and selected production roles) are required to log time regularly.",
    "## Time entry structure\n\nEach time entry contains:\n\n- Employee (employee ID)\n- Customer (optional, usually derived from project)\n- Project (project ID, customer or internal)\n- Date (YYYY‑MM‑DD)\n- Hours (decimal, e.g. 1.0, 7.5)\n- Work category (e.g. `customer_project`, `internal`, `support`, `admin`)\n- Notes (short free text)\n- Billable flag (billable vs non‑billable)\n- Status:\n  - `draft`\n  - `submitted`\n  - `approved`\n  - `invoiced`\n  - `voided`",
    "## Lifecycle of time entries\n\n1. **Draft**\n   - Employee is still editing; corrections are allowed.\n2. **Submitted**\n   - Employee considers entries complete for the period (e.g. week, month).\n3. **Approved**\n   - Supervisor or operations has reviewed entries for consistency.\n4. **Invoiced**\n   - Entries have been used for billing or customer reporting; they are effectively locked.\n5. **Voided**\n   - Entry has been cancelled (e.g. wrong project). Usually paired with a correcting entry.\n\nAfter approval, employees cannot change entries directly; corrections require specific processes to ensure an audit trail."
  ]
}

### Final Result
You can read about how time tracking works in the wiki file: 'systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md'.

Main reasons we track time at Bellini:
- To understand how employees spend their time across customers, projects, and internal activities.
- To enable accurate billing, customer reporting, and calculating billable vs non-billable work.
- For project tracking and analysis, resource planning, and operational reporting.
- To support compliance, workload review, and audit trails through the approval system.

See: systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md in the company wiki for a detailed description of the process and rationale.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-06

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
