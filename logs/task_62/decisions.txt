DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:56:25
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The process is proceeding as planned. Step 1 confirmed the user is authenticated and can read the relevant wiki material according to company policies and the original plan. There are no errors or unexpected results. Step 2 should now be executed to search for candidate wiki files related to time tracking. The plan remains valid and all steps are achievable.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:01:30
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both completed steps (user authentication/authorization and the wiki file candidate search) strictly follow the original plan and produced expected, relevant results. The next step—locating the technical implementation of time tracking—can proceed as described. There are no inconsistencies or missing information impeding progress. Thus, the correct action is to continue with Step 3 per the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:05:23
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have followed the original plan exactly and have produced expected, relevant results. The remaining steps (Step 4 and 5) can be executed as planned: select and analyze the most relevant wiki file describing time tracking, extract process and business rationale details, and provide the final answer. No discrepancies, missing information, or unexpected results have appeared that would require replanning. Task is on track and can proceed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:13:04
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been executed successfully. Step 5 is the only remaining step and can be completed precisely as described: the content from 'systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md' is available, with clearly identified process description sections and rationale. The main reasons the company tracks time can be derived from these sections: understanding employee work, supporting reporting and invoicing, ensuring proper project/customer allocation, enabling approval and audit trails, and supporting both internal and customer needs. All requirements of the original user task can now be fulfilled with the exact wiki file path and a concise summary of the main reasons. Therefore, the task is COMPLETE and the FINAL_ANSWER should be given.
