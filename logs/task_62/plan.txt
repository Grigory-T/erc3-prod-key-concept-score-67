Steps:
  1. Identify current user (who_am_i) and verify that the user has general access to read wiki documentation about time tracking processes.
     Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session endpoint (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity of employee_id=6KR2_151 (Roberto D’Amico). From the response, derive the user’s system roles, department, and generic wiki access rights. Confirm that general, non-confidential process documentation (such as how time tracking works and reasons for tracking time) is accessible. No salary or confidential human resources information is needed or requested. If the user does not have read access to the wiki, further steps must not attempt wiki reads.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "can_read_wiki": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "system_roles", "can_read_wiki"]}
  2. Search internal company wiki or documentation for pages that describe how time tracking works, using fuzzy and semantic or logical search to handle ambiguous or abbreviated terms.
     Approach: Query the wiki_file table (or the wiki search API if available) to find candidate wiki files whose path or content mentions concepts related to time tracking. Use a multi-stage search strategy: (1) exact match search for clear terms such as "time tracking", "timesheet", "time entry", and "time logging" in wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content; (2) if no or few results, perform case-insensitive substring search (for example, convert to lowercase, remove extra whitespace, and check if the search string is contained in the path or content); (3) then apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical search for related or ambiguous terms and abbreviations such as "TT", "time sheets", "work hours", and possible misspellings of "tracking" (for example, "trakcing"). If necessary, list all wiki_file records and pick the ones whose names or content best match the idea of documenting how the time tracking system or time_entry logging works.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"candidate_wiki_files": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"path": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}, "matched_terms": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["path", "match_score"]}}}, "required": ["candidate_wiki_files"]}
  3. Search for related technical implementation of time tracking in company systems (for example, database tables or services that implement time tracking) using fuzzy and semantic or logical search for relevant entities.
     Approach: Inspect the known technical artifacts (such as the SQL schema and any available service registry or internal developer documentation) to find entities and services that implement time tracking. Specifically, look for tables and services whose names or descriptions indicate time logging, such as the time_entry table and any TimeTracking service. Use a fuzzy and semantic or logical search to match on terms like "time entry", "time tracking", "timesheet", "work hours", and similar variations or misspellings. Confirm that the identified technical implementation (for example, the time_entry table in the TimeTracking system) is what the wiki documentation likely refers to when explaining how time tracking works. If no technical implementation objects can be found at all, mark that fact so that the overall task could be aborted due to missing implementation, but only if this completely prevents answering the user’s question.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"technical_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"entity_name": {"type": "string"}, "entity_type": {"type": "string"}, "system_name": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["entity_name", "entity_type", "system_name"]}}, "has_time_tracking_implementation": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["technical_entities", "has_time_tracking_implementation"]}
  4. Select the most relevant wiki file that explains how time tracking works and read its content to identify process details.
     Approach: From the candidate_wiki_files list, choose the wiki file with the highest match_score and most relevant matched_terms (for example, a path like "processes/time_tracking.md" or "operations/timesheets/how_time_tracking_works.md"). Use deterministic tie-breaking rules if needed (for example, prefer files under a processes or operations folder over others). Retrieve the full content field from the wiki_file record for that selected path. Parse the content to locate sections that explicitly describe how the time tracking system works (for example, how employees create time entries, which fields they fill, submission and approval workflow, and any references to time_entry or TimeTracking systems). This step focuses only on understanding and extracting the "how it works" procedural or functional description.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"selected_wiki_path": {"type": "string"}, "wiki_title": {"type": "string"}, "process_description_sections": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["selected_wiki_path", "process_description_sections"]}
  5. From the same wiki content, extract the main reasons why the company tracks time and prepare the final answer, including the exact name (path) of the wiki file where the user can read more.
     Approach: Analyze the content of the selected wiki file’s process_description_sections and any introductory or rationale sections to identify explicit statements of why time is tracked. Use keyword and semantic or logical analysis to locate phrases about business reasons (for example, invoicing and billing, project profitability, resource planning, compliance, capacity planning, understanding workloads, or reporting). Summarize these primary reasons into a concise list while keeping the original meaning. Combine: (1) the wiki file’s path or name (for example, "processes/time_tracking_overview.md"), and (2) the summarized list of main reasons, into a structured output that can directly answer the user’s question about where to read about time tracking and what the main reasons for tracking time are.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"wiki_file_path": {"type": "string"}, "wiki_file_name": {"type": "string"}, "main_reasons_for_time_tracking": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["wiki_file_path", "main_reasons_for_time_tracking"]}
