DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:51:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been fully and correctly executed: the employee 'Olivera Tomić' was uniquely identified with no ambiguity and in compliance with all company and task requirements. The next planned step (Step 2) is to check user permissions for viewing/modifying salary for the identified employee, which is expected and necessary before any access or updates to sensitive fields. There are no inconsistencies, unexpected results, or missing information. The step progression aligns exactly with the original plan and company policy, so the process should proceed as laid out.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:53:59
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 produced expected results and strictly followed all permissions checks in the original plan. The user does not have permission to view or modify salary, which will make actual salary update impossible, but the next step (Step 3) involves only retrieving notes—this is allowed. The company rules say do not abort if the next step can still theoretically complete, and the plan does not instruct to reconsider based on lack of permission at this point; it only requires reporting in the final outcome. Therefore, continue to Step 3.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:58:02
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The original plan is being followed and all completed steps have produced relevant, correct, and expected results. Step 3 confirmed that there is no CEO approval note for a salary increase for the employee Olivera Tomić, which means the precondition for carrying out Steps 4 and 5 (salary update) is not satisfied. According to the original plan, if no CEO approval note is found, the process should output a summary (Step 5) concluding that no CEO approval exists and thus no salary update will occur. No replanning is necessary, and the task can be completed with a final answer per plan.
