Step 1: Identify and uniquely resolve the employee record for "Tomić Olivera" in the EmployeeRegistry (employee table), handling possible diacritics, typos, or name-order variations using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the target employee. First attempt an exact match on the full name "Tomić Olivera" using a normalized form (lowercasing, trimming whitespace, and normalizing Unicode diacritics). If no exact match is found, relax filters: search where the normalized input string is contained in employee.name (using a case-insensitive, whitespace-normalized comparison). If still not found, perform fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) over all employee.name values to account for typos, missing diacritics, or swapped first and last names, and optionally apply SEMANTIC / LOGICAL checks (e.g., tokenized comparison of first and last name order). Use a confidence threshold (for example, 0.8) to decide if a single best match is acceptable. If multiple candidates exceed the threshold, mark the result as ambiguous (requiring clarification). Do not retrieve the salary field at this step; only retrieve non-sensitive fields such as id, name, email, location, and department. 
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]}}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidates"]}
