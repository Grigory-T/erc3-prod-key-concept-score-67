I have executed Step 1 as instructed. The employee "Tomić Olivera" was uniquely identified as "Olivera Tomić" with employee ID "BwFV_098". The search process involved:
1. **Exact match on normalized name**: No match found after normalizing diacritics and case.
2. **Contained match**: No matches where the normalized target string is contained in employee names or vice versa.
3. **Semantic/Logical match**: Found one employee where the tokenized name matches exactly: "Olivera Tomić" (id: BwFV_098). The tokens "tomic" and "olivera" are present in reverse order, confirming it's the same person.
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy_compare with a confidence threshold of 0.8. The top match was "Olivera Tomić" with a ratio of 0.538, below the threshold, indicating no high-confidence fuzzy matches. No other candidates exceeded the threshold, so no ambiguity.

Only non-sensitive fields (id, name, email, location, department) were accessed during the main identification process via list_all_employees() and subsequent filtering. The verification step included a call to get_employee() for confirmation, but salary and notes fields were not retrieved or used in the output. No state-changing operations were performed.
