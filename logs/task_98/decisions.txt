DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:23:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 1) was done correctly per the original plan: requirements were parsed, structured, and confirmed. The next step in the plan is to identify the target project using the specified matching criteria. No inconsistencies or unexpected issues have arisen. There is no reason to deviate from the plan. Continue with Step 2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:27:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both Step 1 and Step 2 produced results exactly as expected per the plan. All matching strategies succeeded, and there is a definitive, unambiguous project match. There are no errors, ambiguities, or missing functionalities. The original plan remains applicable, and the immediate next step is to check current user permissions for time_entry data per Step 3.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:29:41
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All planned steps so far have been executed successfully and have produced results perfectly matching the expectations set by the original plan. The last completed step was a permission check for access to project time entries, which returned positive (access granted) with no unexpected issues or data inconsistencies. The next step is to retrieve the actual time_entry records as described in the plan. There are no discrepancies or new information requiring a replan. Therefore, it is appropriate to continue with the next step as outlined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:30:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have returned expected and correct results according to the exact plan. The data from step 4 provides the necessary time entries, and the current stage is to aggregate them (step 5) and prepare the summary (step 6), which are straightforward given the available information. No errors, ambiguities, or missing information encountered, so the original stepwise plan is still fully valid. There is no indication that replanning or aborting is needed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:32:46
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have returned correct and expected results: (1) the requirements were structured, (2) the project was found unambiguously, (3) permissions were checked and access allowed, (4) time entry data was fetched as expected, (5) total/billable/non-billable hours were accurately aggregated. The last remaining step is to prepare the final summary. This is a straightforward output synthesis from the data returned in step 5. No new information, errors, or inconsistencies are present; all steps followed the original plan and there is enough verified data to prepare the final answer. There is no need to replan or abort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:34:08
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan were executed precisely as described. Each step produced the expected and correct result, and no inconsistencies or unexpected results occurred at any stage. The final output (summary of total, billable, and non-billable hours for the specified project and date range) is directly derived from validated data, meeting the user's request and the planned end goal. No further steps are necessary and the task is complete.
