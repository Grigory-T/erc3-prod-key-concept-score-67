Step 5: Aggregate the retrieved time entries to compute total hours and the billable versus non-billable breakdown for the specified period.
Approach: Take the list of time_entries from the previous step (which may be empty) and iterate over each record. Sum the hours field across all entries to compute total_hours. Separately, sum hours where billable is true to compute billable_hours, and sum hours where billable is false to compute non_billable_hours. Ensure numeric precision is preserved according to the DECIMAL(4,2) definition. If there are no entries (due to no data, missing project, or access denial), the totals should be zero and an appropriate explanation retained for the next step.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "has_data": {"type": "boolean"}, "aggregation_notes": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "date_start", "date_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours", "has_data", "aggregation_notes"]}
