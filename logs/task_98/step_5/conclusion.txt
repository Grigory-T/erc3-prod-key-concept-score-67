STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:32:43

Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as described: I aggregated the time entries retrieved in Step 4 by iterating over each record, summing the hours field across all entries to compute total_hours, and separately summing hours where billable is true (billable_hours) and where billable is false (non_billable_hours). All facts were verified from function returns:

1. Project name was retrieved via get_project() and verified by printing: "Bogie component coating system"
2. Time entries were retrieved via search_time_entries() with proper pagination (max 5 per page)
3. Found exactly 2 time entries matching Step 4 results
4. Aggregated values: 4.0 hours (billable) + 2.5 hours (non-billable) = 6.5 total hours
5. All numeric values preserved DECIMAL(4,2) precision as shown in printed results
6. No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations)
7. No data was invented or assumed - all values come from actual function returns
