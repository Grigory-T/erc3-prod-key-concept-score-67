Step 6: Prepare the final response summarizing total, billable, and non-billable hours for the project 'Bogie component coating system' in March 2025.
Approach: Using the aggregation results, construct a clear textual summary that answers: (1) the total number of hours logged on the project between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, and (2) the breakdown into billable and non-billable hours. If the project was not found, time entries were not accessible, or no entries exist, explicitly state this along with zero totals as appropriate. Ensure the answer references the project by its resolved name and clarifies the exact date range covered.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_reported": {"type": "string"}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "summary_text": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["project_name_reported", "date_start", "date_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours", "summary_text"]}
