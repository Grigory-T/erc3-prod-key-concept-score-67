Step 6 completed successfully. I used the verified aggregation results from Step 5 to prepare the final response summarizing total, billable, and non-billable hours for the project "Bogie component coating system" for March 2025. The summary includes the exact date range, total hours, and breakdown as requested.

All data comes directly from verified function returns in previous steps. No state-changing operations were performed in this step - only data presentation.
