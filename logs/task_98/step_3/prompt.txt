Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (BwFV_139 / Ignazio Bianco) to read time entry data for the identified project and period.
Approach: After the target project has been identified (or ambiguity established), call an internal authorization or who_am_i-style mechanism using the bound identity of the current user (employee id BwFV_139, department Finance and Administration, location HQ – Italy). Determine whether this user is allowed to read time_entry records for the given project_id and the date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31. Use company policies about roles and data visibility; do not assume elevated rights beyond what is granted to this user. The step outcome should clearly state whether access is allowed or denied, and if denied, provide a non-sensitive reason. No time_entry data should be returned if access is denied.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "can_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["employee_id", "project_id", "date_start", "date_end", "can_view_time_entries", "denial_reason"]}
