I have executed the step instruction exactly as described. I parsed the task text to extract the exact start date, end date, and project reference string. I confirmed the period is from 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31 inclusive and identified the required metrics: total hours and a breakdown into billable and non-billable hours. No API or database calls were made, as this step is purely about structuring requirements.

{
  "project_name_ref": "Bogie component coating system",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",
  "date_end": "2025-03-31",
  "need_total_hours": true,
  "need_billable_breakdown": true
}
