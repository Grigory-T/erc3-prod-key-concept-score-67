Step 1: Interpret and formalize the reporting requirements from the task, including exact date range and required breakdowns.
Approach: Parse the task text to extract the exact start date, end date, and the project reference string. Confirm that the period is from 2025-03-01 (inclusive) to 2025-03-31 (inclusive). Identify that the required metrics are: total hours logged on the target project in this period, and a breakdown of these hours into billable and non-billable. No database or API calls are performed in this step; this is purely about structuring the requirements for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_ref": {"type": "string"}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "need_total_hours": {"type": "boolean"}, "need_billable_breakdown": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["project_name_ref", "date_start", "date_end", "need_total_hours", "need_billable_breakdown"]}
