We are in Step 1: Interpret and formalize the reporting requirements from the task, including exact date range and required breakdowns.
 We are to parse the task text and extract the exact start date, end date, and the project reference string.
 The task text: "Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, how many hours in total did we log on project Bogie component coating system? Please also break it down into billable and non‑billable hours."

 From this, we extract:
   - project_name_ref: "Bogie component coating system"
   - date_start: "2025-03-01"
   - date_end: "2025-03-31"
   - need_total_hours: True (because the question asks for total hours)
   - need_billable_breakdown: True (because it asks for breakdown into billable and non-billable)

 We are to output a JSON object with these properties.

 Since no API calls are needed, we just need to produce the JSON.

 However, note that the step says "No database or API calls are performed in this step; this is purely about structuring the requirements for subsequent steps."

 We are to output in the following JSON structure:
   {
     "project_name_ref": "Bogie component coating system",
     "date_start": "2025-03-01",
     "date_end": "2025-03-31",
     "need_total_hours": true,
     "need_billable_breakdown": true
   }

 Let's double-check the task: It says "Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31", so inclusive of both dates.
 We are to confirm that the period is from 2025-03-01 (inclusive) to 2025-03-31 (inclusive).

 We are also to note that the project reference string is "Bogie component coating system".

 We'll output the JSON as required.

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-10 00:23:32
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The step requires interpreting and formalizing the reporting requirements from the task text. The task text is: "Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, how many hours in total did we log on project Bogie component coating system? Please also break it down into billable and non‑billable hours."

From this, I need to extract:
- project reference string: "Bogie component coating system"
- date range: start date 2025-03-01, end date 2025-03-31
- need total hours: yes (the question asks "how many hours in total")
- need billable breakdown: yes ("break it down into billable and non‑billable hours")

No API calls are to be made in this step. The output is a JSON object with those properties.

I have already provided that. The verification asks to confirm that I executed the step instruction, did not skip or assume anything, and all facts are verified.

I did not call any functions; I only parsed the text. The facts are from the task description itself. The step says "No database or API calls are performed in this step". So I'm fine.

Thus, my previous answer is correct. I'll repeat the final_answer and json blocks.
