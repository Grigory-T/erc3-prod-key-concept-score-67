Step 2: Identify the target project in the project table that corresponds to the name reference 'Bogie component coating system'.
Approach: Query the project table to find the project whose name matches the reference 'Bogie component coating system'. First, attempt an exact match on project.name (case-sensitive), then a case-insensitive exact match, then a case-insensitive substring search where the normalized reference string is contained in the normalized project.name. If still unclear, use **FUZZY** matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar fuzzy_compare) along with **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (e.g., token-based similarity, handling possible typos, pluralization, and word order changes) across project.name and project.id. If multiple candidates are found with similar scores, collect them all and mark the result as ambiguous; if no sufficiently similar candidate is found, mark the project as not found. Account explicitly for potential misspellings, partial names, or naming variations when searching.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_ref_used": {"type": "string"}, "matched": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidate_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "similarity_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "similarity_score"]}}}, "required": ["project_name_ref_used", "matched", "ambiguous", "project_id", "project_name", "candidate_projects"]}
