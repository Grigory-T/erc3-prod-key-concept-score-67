Step 2 completed successfully. I identified the target project by querying the project table using multiple matching strategies as instructed: exact case-sensitive match, case-insensitive exact match, case-insensitive substring search, token-based semantic search, and fuzzy matching. The project "Bogie component coating system" has an exact match with project ID "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system". The fuzzy matching results show no other projects with similarly high scores (next highest is 0.6670), so the match is not ambiguous. All data was verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.
