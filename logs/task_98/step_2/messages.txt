## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-04-10
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_139
User details: {"id": "BwFV_139", "name": "Ignazio Bianco", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, how many hours in total did we log on project Bogie component coating system? Please also break it down into billable and non‑billable hours.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Interpret and formalize the reporting requirements from the task, including exact date range and required breakdowns.
Approach: Parse the task text to extract the exact start date, end date, and the project reference string. Confirm that the period is from 2025-03-01 (inclusive) to 2025-03-31 (inclusive). Identify that the required metrics are: total hours logged on the target project in this period, and a breakdown of these hours into billable and non-billable. No database or API calls are performed in this step; this is purely about structuring the requirements for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_ref": {"type": "string"}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "need_total_hours": {"type": "boolean"}, "need_billable_breakdown": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["project_name_ref", "date_start", "date_end", "need_total_hours", "need_billable_breakdown"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction exactly as described. I parsed the task text to extract the exact start date, end date, and project reference string. I confirmed the period is from 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31 inclusive and identified the required metrics: total hours and a breakdown into billable and non-billable hours. No API or database calls were made, as this step is purely about structuring requirements.

{
  "project_name_ref": "Bogie component coating system",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",
  "date_end": "2025-03-31",
  "need_total_hours": true,
  "need_billable_breakdown": true
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the target project in the project table that corresponds to the name reference 'Bogie component coating system'.
Approach: Query the project table to find the project whose name matches the reference 'Bogie component coating system'. First, attempt an exact match on project.name (case-sensitive), then a case-insensitive exact match, then a case-insensitive substring search where the normalized reference string is contained in the normalized project.name. If still unclear, use **FUZZY** matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar fuzzy_compare) along with **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (e.g., token-based similarity, handling possible typos, pluralization, and word order changes) across project.name and project.id. If multiple candidates are found with similar scores, collect them all and mark the result as ambiguous; if no sufficiently similar candidate is found, mark the project as not found. Account explicitly for potential misspellings, partial names, or naming variations when searching.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_ref_used": {"type": "string"}, "matched": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidate_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "similarity_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "similarity_score"]}}}, "required": ["project_name_ref_used", "matched", "ambiguous", "project_id", "project_name", "candidate_projects"]}

I'll execute step 2 to identify the target project corresponding to "Bogie component coating system". Let me start by getting all projects and then applying various matching strategies.

```python
# First, get current context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, department: {ctx.department}")

# Get all projects to search through
all_projects = list_all_projects()
print(f"Total projects available: {len(all_projects)}")

# Print first few to see structure
print("\nFirst 5 projects:")
for i, proj in enumerate(all_projects[:5]):
    print(f"  {i+1}. ID: {proj.id}, Name: {proj.name}, Customer: {proj.customer}")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[USER] (message 3)

Now let me search for the project "Bogie component coating system" using various matching strategies as described in the step.

```python
# Define the target project reference
project_ref = "Bogie component coating system"
print(f"Target project reference: '{project_ref}'")

    normalized_id = proj.id.lower().replace("_", "")
    
    # Check if reference is contained in name or id
    if project_ref.lower() in proj.name.lower() or normalized_ref in normalized_name:
        substring_matches.append(proj)
        print(f"Found in name substring: ID: {proj.id}, Name: {proj.name}")
    elif project_ref.lower() in proj.id.lower() or normalized_ref in normalized_id:
        substring_matches.append(proj)
        print(f"Found in ID substring: ID: {proj.id}, Name: {proj.name}")

# Strategy 4: Try searching by individual words/tokens
print("\n=== Strategy 4: Token-based search ===")
tokens = ["bogie", "component", "coating", "system"]
token_matches = {}
for token in tokens:
    matches_for_token = []
    for proj in all_projects:
        if token in proj.name.lower() or token in proj.id.lower():

candidate_projects = []

# Add the exact match with score 1.0
candidate_projects.append({
    "project_id": "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system",
    "project_name": "Bogie component coating system",
    "similarity_score": 1.0
})

# Add other candidates from fuzzy matching that might be relevant

Step 2 completed successfully. I identified the target project by searching through all available projects using multiple matching strategies: exact match (case-sensitive and case-insensitive), substring search, token-based search, and fuzzy matching. The project "Bogie component coating system" has an exact match in the system with project ID "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system". There is no ambiguity as the next highest similarity score from fuzzy matching is only 0.6670, significantly lower than the perfect 1.0 match.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the target project in the project table that corresponds to the name reference 'Bogie component coating system'.
Approach: Query the project table to find the project whose name matches the reference 'Bogie component coating system'. First, attempt an exact match on project.name (case-sensitive), then a case-insensitive exact match, then a case-insensitive substring search where the normalized reference string is contained in the normalized project.name. If still unclear, use **FUZZY** matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance or similar fuzzy_compare) along with **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (e.g., token-based similarity, handling possible typos, pluralization, and word order changes) across project.name and project.id. If multiple candidates are found with similar scores, collect them all and mark the result as ambiguous; if no sufficiently similar candidate is found, mark the project as not found. Account explicitly for potential misspellings, partial names, or naming variations when searching.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_name_ref_used": {"type": "string"}, "matched": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_name": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "candidate_projects": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_name": {"type": "string"}, "similarity_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "similarity_score"]}}}, "required": ["project_name_ref_used", "matched", "ambiguous", "project_id", "project_name", "candidate_projects"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

Step 2 completed successfully. I identified the target project by querying the project table using multiple matching strategies as instructed: exact case-sensitive match, case-insensitive exact match, case-insensitive substring search, token-based semantic search, and fuzzy matching. The project "Bogie component coating system" has an exact match with project ID "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system". The fuzzy matching results show no other projects with similarly high scores (next highest is 0.6670), so the match is not ambiguous. All data was verified through function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.
