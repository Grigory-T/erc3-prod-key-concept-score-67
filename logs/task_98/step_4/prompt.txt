Step 4: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified project within the date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31, provided access is allowed.
Approach: If the previous step confirms that the user can view time entries for the project, execute a SQL query on the time_entry table filtering by the resolved project_id and by entry_date between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive. Do not add any extra filters not stated in the task (for example, do not filter by status; include entries in any status such as draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, or voided). Select at least the columns: id, employee_id, project_id, entry_date, hours, billable, and status. If the project was not found or access was denied, this step should return an empty list and a flag explaining why no data was fetched.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "date_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "data_accessed": {"type": "boolean"}, "no_data_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["id", "employee_id", "project_id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["project_id", "date_start", "date_end", "data_accessed", "no_data_reason", "time_entries"]}
