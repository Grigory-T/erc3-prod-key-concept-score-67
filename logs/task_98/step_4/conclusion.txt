STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:30:52

I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I verified all facts directly from function returns without making assumptions:

1. Confirmed project ID "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system" from previous step
2. Confirmed date range "2025-03-01" to "2025-03-31" 
3. Used the search_time_entries() function with project filter and date range to retrieve all records
4. Did not add any extra filters (no status filtering) as instructed
5. Retrieved all required columns: id, employee_id, project_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status
6. Verified through pagination that all 2 entries were retrieved
7. All data in the JSON response comes directly from printed function returns
8. No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations)

The search returned 2 time entries for the specified project and date range, confirming data access was successful.
