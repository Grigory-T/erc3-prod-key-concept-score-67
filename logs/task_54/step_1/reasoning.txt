We are acting on behalf of user Bhwa_050 (Riccardo Benedetti) from R&D and Technical Service, HQ Italy.
 The step is to identify and retrieve the target project record for project identifier 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'.
 We must first try exact match on the 'id' field, then progressively relax the search if not found.

 Approach:
 1. Use get_project(project_id) to attempt exact match on id.
 2. If not found, we will search by query (which likely searches in id, name, description) and also apply fuzzy matching.

 However, note: the available function for searching projects is `search_projects` which takes a `query` parameter.
 We can also use `list_all_projects` to get all projects and then apply our own fuzzy matching.

 Since the step requires fuzzy and semantic matching, we might need to use `fuzzy_compare` or `fuzzy_find_in_text` on the list of projects.

 Let's break down:

 Step 1: Exact match by id.
 Step 2: If not found, search by query (case-insensitive, partial) in id, name, description.
 Step 3: If still not found, use fuzzy matching on the list of project ids and names.

 We have to be careful about the number of projects. We can use `list_all_projects` to get all projects and then apply our own matching.

 However, note: `list_all_projects` returns a list of ProjectBrief, which has fields: id, name, customer, status.
 We don't have description in ProjectBrief. For description, we would need to get each project individually, which is expensive.

 Alternatively, we can use `search_projects` with query set to the normalized string (without underscores) and see if it returns any.

 Let's follow the step instructions:

 1. Exact match on id: call get_project('proj_nordport_ramp_flooring')
 2. If not found, then:
    - Normalize the string by removing underscores and lowercasing: 'projnordportrampflooring'
    - Use `search_projects` with query as the normalized string? But note: the search_projects function might do a text search in multiple fields.
    - We can also use `list_all_projects` and then filter by checking if the normalized string is in the id or name (without underscores and lowercased).
 3. If still not found, use fuzzy matching with `fuzzy_compare` on the list of project ids and names.

 We'll try to get the exact match first.

 Also note: the expected output includes a project object with fields: id, name, description, customer_id, status.
 We can get the project by `get_project` which returns ProjectFull, which has description and customer (which is the customer id).

 However, if we don't find by exact id, we might have to get the project by the id we found via fuzzy, and then return the full project.

 Let's code accordingly.

We are done with the exact match. We found the project.
 Now we need to structure the output according to the expected format.
 Since we found exactly one project, project_found=True, ambiguous=False, candidate_count=1.
 We need to return the project object with the required properties.

Let's verify the step execution thoroughly.

Step 1 requires:
1. Exact match on 'id' field: I used `get_project("proj_nordport_ramp_flooring")` and found a project.
2. If exactly one project is found, return that record.

The output shows:
- Found exact match with ID=proj_nordport_ramp_flooring, Name=Loading ramp and dock floor system, Status=exploring.
- Customer: cust_nordport_logistics, Description length: 82.

But note: the description length is 82, meaning there is a description (not null). However, in the JSON I set "description": null. That's incorrect based on the print statement: "Description length: 82". Actually, the print statement says "Description length: 82", which implies there is a description string of length 82. But the `project_exact.description` might be a string. I didn't print the actual description content, but the length is non-zero. So "description" should not be null.

Let me check: In the print statement, I printed `len(project_exact.description) if project_exact.description else 0`. Since the length is 82, that means `project_exact.description` is truthy, i.e., a non-empty string. Therefore, in the JSON, "description" should be that string, not null.

But wait: I didn't actually retrieve the description string value. I only have the length. To include the description in the JSON, I need to get the actual description content. However, the expected output schema says description is of type ["string","null"]. So I need to provide the actual description string if it exists.

I could either:
1. Assume that since length is 82, description is a string, and I can get it from the project object.
2. Actually print the description to verify.

But note: The step says "retrieve the target project record". The `get_project` function returns a `ProjectFull` object which includes description. I already have that object. So I should extract the description field from it.

In my code, I stored the result in `project_exact`. I can access `project_exact.description`.

Let me run additional code to print the description (or at least a snippet) to verify its content. However, note that the step is already complete? Actually, the verification asks to confirm that I executed the step instruction fully.

I should ensure that all facts are verified. The description field is part of the expected output. I should include the actual description string, not assume null.

Let me adjust: Since I already have the project object, I can just use its description attribute. But I need to be careful: The `ProjectFull` object has a description attribute. In the print statement, I only printed the length, not the content. But the object is still in memory? Actually, in the code execution, I printed and then the code ended. The variable `project_exact` is not available now for additional queries because the execution environment might have reset.

But I can run another code block to retrieve the project again, or I could have stored it in a variable that persists. However, the verification step is happening now, and I can run more code.

Given the instruction: "If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks." But I realize my JSON had an error: I set description to null when it actually has content. So I need to correct that.

I should run a quick code to get the project again (or use the existing variable if possible) and extract the description. Since the execution environment might be fresh, I'll run a new code block.

But note: The verification step allows me to execute missing actions. So I'll run a small code to get the project and print the description, then update JSON accordingly.

However, I must be careful: calling `get_project` again is a read operation, not state-changing, so it's fine.

Let me run:

```python
# Retrieve the project again to get description
project = get_project("proj_nordport_ramp_flooring")
if project:
    print(f"Project ID: {project.id}")
    print(f"Description: {project.description}")
    # Show first 100 chars if long
    if project.description:
        print(f"Description snippet: {project.description[:100]}...")
    else:
        print("Description is None")
```

But wait: In the initial output, I printed "Description length: 82". So it's likely a string of 82 characters. So I can set description to that string.

Alternatively, since I already know the length is 82, I can be confident that description is not null. However, to be safe and follow "all facts verified", I should actually retrieve and verify.

Let me run the code.

We have successfully found the project with the exact match. The verification step confirms the same.
 We have not changed any state (only read operations).
 The description is not null, so we should include it in the JSON.

 Let me adjust the JSON to include the actual description.
