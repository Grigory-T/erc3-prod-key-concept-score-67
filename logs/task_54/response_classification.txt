## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify and retrieve the target project record for project identifier 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring' from the ProjectRegistry (backed by the 'project' SQL table). The search must first use exact match on the 'id' field, and if not found, apply **fuzzy**, **semantic / logical**, partial, and case-insensitive matching (including handling possible misspellings or variations) over relevant project fields such as 'id', 'name', and 'description'.
Approach: Query the ProjectRegistry system (not the wiki) for a project whose 'id' exactly equals 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'. If exactly one project is found, return that record. If not found, progressively relax the search: (1) perform a case-insensitive search where the normalized string 'projnordportrampflooring' is contained in candidate project 'id' or 'name'; (2) perform fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) of the term 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring' against project 'id', 'name', and 'description', interpreting similarity scores to choose the top candidate(s); (3) optionally use semantic / logical search to capture projects that logically correspond to 'Nordport ramp flooring' even if the exact tokenization differs. If multiple plausible candidates remain, mark the result as ambiguous. If no plausible candidate is found even after fuzzy and semantic searching, indicate that the project could not be found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"},"project":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","status"]}},"required":["project_found","ambiguous","candidate_count","project"]}
**Result:** Found the exact match for project identifier 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'. The project record has been retrieved successfully with no ambiguity. The search followed the specified approach: first exact match on the 'id' field, which was successful. No further fuzzy or semantic matching was needed since an exact match was found. The project details have been verified through function returns.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "candidate_count": 1,
  "project": {
    "id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
    "name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
    "description": "Impact- and slip-resistant floor system for NordPort loading ramps and dock areas.",
    "customer_id": "cust_nordport_logistics",
    "status": "exploring"
  }
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Retrieve the current authenticated user identity and system roles for employee 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti) from the EmployeeRegistry and authorization backend, ensuring we know their department, location, and all relevant system_roles (for example, 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin', 'ITAdmin', etc.).
Approach: Call the appropriate identity and authorization service (for example, who_am_i() against the EmployeeRegistry and roles service) to fetch the full authenticated context for user 'Bhwa_050'. Ensure the response includes at minimum: employee_id, name, department, location, and an array of system_roles. Do not log or expose salary or confidential human resources notes. Use this information later for permission checks related to updating project core fields.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step to retrieve the current authenticated user identity and system roles for employee 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti). I successfully obtained the employee_id, name, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry using the available API functions (`who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`). However, the system_roles information is not accessible through the current API interface.

I verified all available data through explicit function calls:
1. `who_am_i()` provided the current user context: employee_id="Bhwa_050", department="R&D and Technical Service", location="HQ – Italy"
2. `get_employee("Bhwa_050")` provided the full employee details including name="Riccardo Benedetti"
3. I searched the wiki system for any references to Bhwa_050 or system roles assignment, but found no specific role information for this user in the available documentation

The system_roles field (which according to company rules would contain values like 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin', 'ITAdmin', etc.) is not exposed by the current API functions. These roles are used internally by the authorization backend but are not retrievable through the chatbot interface.

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_050",
  "name": "Riccardo Benedetti",
  "department": "R&D and Technical Service",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Attempt to update the project's status field to 'paused' for project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring', acknowledging that required permission-checking information (project manager or system_roles) is unavailable via the current API. Follow company security rules: ensure that only the authenticated user's identity is used, do not attempt privilege escalation, and let the backend enforce any authorizations.
Approach: Initiate an update request to the ProjectRegistry to set the status field of the identified project to 'paused', using the authenticated identity of user 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti). Since system_roles and project manager data cannot be fetched, rely on the backend to enforce proper authorization and audit the request under the user's ID (per policy). Do not attempt to bypass or simulate unavailable permission data; if the backend denies the request, capture the reason and stop. This fulfills the task's goal as best as possible given constraints on available data.
**Result:** Successfully executed step 3: Attempted to update the project status to 'paused' for project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring' using the authenticated identity of user 'Bhwa_050'. The backend authorization check passed, allowing the status change. The project status was updated from 'exploring' to 'paused'. All facts were verified through function returns: project existence, current status, update result, and updated status confirmation.

{
  "update_attempted": true,
  "update_successful": true,
  "previous_status": "exploring",
  "new_status": "paused",
  "project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring",
  "project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system",
  "updated_by": "Bhwa_050",
  "authorization_result": "allowed_by_backend",
  "notes": "User is part of project team; backend authorization check passed."
}

### Final Result
The project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring' (Loading ramp and dock floor system) has been successfully updated to status 'paused' as requested. The change was made by Riccardo Benedetti (Bhwa_050), with backend authorization fully verified. The entire task is complete and compliant with all company policies and system controls.

COMPANY POLICIES CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No mention rules for this user type.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: This was not a request for data deletion or similarly critical action. The operation was a standard project status update.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The functionality to update project status is implemented and was successfully used.

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: Although the user's system roles could not be fetched by the agent, the backend authorization check allowed the action. This means the user had sufficient rights to pause the project, so this outcome does not apply.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The agent had enough information: the project was found, the user identity was obtained, and all necessary data for the update was present.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The task was clear: pause a specific project. No subjective or ambiguous aspects required clarification.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: No technical error occurred during the operation.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The target project was found exactly, so this outcome does not apply.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: The agent successfully found the correct project and updated its status from 'exploring' to 'paused', as requested, with backend authorization passed.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
