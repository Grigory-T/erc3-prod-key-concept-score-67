Step 2: Retrieve the current authenticated user identity and system roles for employee 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti) from the EmployeeRegistry and authorization backend, ensuring we know their department, location, and all relevant system_roles (for example, 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin', 'ITAdmin', etc.).
Approach: Call the appropriate identity and authorization service (for example, who_am_i() against the EmployeeRegistry and roles service) to fetch the full authenticated context for user 'Bhwa_050'. Ensure the response includes at minimum: employee_id, name, department, location, and an array of system_roles. Do not log or expose salary or confidential human resources notes. Use this information later for permission checks related to updating project core fields.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
