STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

I have executed the step to retrieve the current authenticated user identity and system roles for employee 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti). I successfully obtained the employee_id, name, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry using the available API functions (`who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`). However, the system_roles information is not accessible through the current API interface.

I verified all available data through explicit function calls:
1. `who_am_i()` provided the current user context: employee_id="Bhwa_050", department="R&D and Technical Service", location="HQ – Italy"
2. `get_employee("Bhwa_050")` provided the full employee details including name="Riccardo Benedetti"
3. I searched the wiki system for any references to Bhwa_050 or system roles assignment, but found no specific role information for this user in the available documentation

The system_roles field (which according to company rules would contain values like 'DepartmentLeader', 'ProjectAdmin', 'ITAdmin', etc.) is not exposed by the current API functions. These roles are used internally by the authorization backend but are not retrievable through the chatbot interface.

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.
