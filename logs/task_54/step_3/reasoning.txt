We are at step 3. We have already found the project in step 1 and retrieved user identity in step 2.
 Step 3: Attempt to update the project's status field to 'paused' for project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'.
 Approach: We will call the update_project_status function with the project_id and the new status 'paused', and set changed_by to the current user's id (Bhwa_050).
 However, note the company rules: only the project manager or users with certain system roles (DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin) can update project core fields.
 Since we don't have the project manager information and the system_roles are not available, we rely on the backend to enforce authorization.

 Steps:
 1. We already have the project id from step 1: 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'
 2. We have the current user id: 'Bhwa_050'
 3. Call update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by) with status='paused' and changed_by='Bhwa_050'
 4. The function returns a boolean indicating success.
 5. If the update fails (returns False) or if there is an authorization denial, we capture that.

 However, note the company rules: 
   IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
     REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
   ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';

 Since we don't have the project manager, we cannot check. We will attempt the update and let the backend decide.

 Important: We should first get the current project to see its status and who the project manager is? 
 But note: the function update_project_status only requires project_id and status. We don't have a way to get the project manager via the current API? 
 Actually, the ProjectFull object returned by get_project does not include a project_manager field. It includes a team list, but we don't know which one is the manager.

 However, the company rules mention that the project manager is stored (probably in the project record) and we don't have access to that field via the current API.

 So we will proceed with the update and let the backend enforce.

 Let's do it step by step.

 But note: We are not allowed to use any invented defaults. We must use the exact function.

 Also, note that the update_project_status function signature is:
   update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool

 We will call it and print the result.

 Since this is a state-changing operation, we call it once and print the result.

 Let's write the code.

We have successfully updated the project status to 'paused'. The update_project_status function returned True, indicating the backend allowed the change.
 Let's now provide the final answer in the required JSON format.
 Since the step was to attempt the update and we succeeded, we can report the success.

The user is asking for verification of step completion. I need to review what I did in step 3 against the checklist and step description.

Step description: "Attempt to update the project's status field to 'paused' for project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring'... acknowledge permission-checking info unavailable... use authenticated identity... backend enforces authorization."

I executed exactly that:
1. I retrieved current context with who_am_i().
2. I verified project exists with get_project().
3. I attempted update_project_status with status="paused" and changed_by=ctx.current_user.
4. The backend allowed it (returned True).
5. I printed results and verified updated status.

Checklist:
- Executed step instruction: Yes, I initiated update request with authenticated user identity.
- Skipped or assumed: I did not skip any actions. I did not assume any permissions; I relied on backend enforcement as instructed.
- All facts verified: I printed function returns: project details, update result, and verified updated status.
- JSON contains only printed/verified values: The JSON I provided includes fields that were printed (update_successful, previous_status, new_status, etc.). All derived from function returns.
- No made-up data: All data from prints.
- No fuzzy matching needed because project ID exact match.
- I called update function only once (as shown in code output with warning).
- I included explicit info about state change in final_answer.

Thus, step is complete. I should repeat final_answer and JSON blocks.
