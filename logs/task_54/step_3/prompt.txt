Step 3: Attempt to update the project's status field to 'paused' for project 'proj_nordport_ramp_flooring', acknowledging that required permission-checking information (project manager or system_roles) is unavailable via the current API. Follow company security rules: ensure that only the authenticated user's identity is used, do not attempt privilege escalation, and let the backend enforce any authorizations.
Approach: Initiate an update request to the ProjectRegistry to set the status field of the identified project to 'paused', using the authenticated identity of user 'Bhwa_050' (Riccardo Benedetti). Since system_roles and project manager data cannot be fetched, rely on the backend to enforce proper authorization and audit the request under the user's ID (per policy). Do not attempt to bypass or simulate unavailable permission data; if the backend denies the request, capture the reason and stop. This fulfills the task's goal as best as possible given constraints on available data.
