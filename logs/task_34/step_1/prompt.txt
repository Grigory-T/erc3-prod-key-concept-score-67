Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Y = Valentina Rinaldi, user id 6KR2_001) and retrieve her core profile and system roles using a who_am_i() style call to the EmployeeRegistry / authentication service.
Approach: Call the authentication/identity service (who_am_i or equivalent) to resolve the current session user to an employee record. Use the returned identifier to look up the corresponding row in the employee table by exact id match if possible; if the id format differs, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on employee.id, employee.email, and employee.name to robustly locate the correct employee record (handling potential formatting differences, typos, or variations). From the identity service and/or related roles table, retrieve the list of system_roles (for example: 'ProjectLead', 'TimesheetAdmin', 'DepartmentLeader', 'Executive', etc.). Do not access or expose salary. The goal is to obtain the definitive user_id, department, location, and system_roles for subsequent permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","system_roles"]}
