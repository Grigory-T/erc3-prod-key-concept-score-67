I have verified the execution of Step 5 and confirm that all requirements were met:

1. **Step Execution**: I followed the exact approach specified in the step description:
   - Used the projects list from Step 3 (4 projects where Schneider Jonas/6KR2_033 is a member)
   - Used the Lead projects from Step 4 (0 projects where Valentina Rinaldi/6KR2_001 is Lead)
   - Implemented Steps 2, 5, and 6 of the mandatory algorithm as specified

2. **Algorithm Implementation**:
   - **Step 2 (Filtering)**: Applied exact, case-insensitive match of project_ref against project.name and project.id
     - Found exact match: "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade" = "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade" (project ID: proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts)
     - No need for substring or fuzzy matching since exact match was found
   - **Step 5 (Actionable Projects)**: Computed intersection of filtered X projects and Y lead projects
     - Filtered projects: 1 project (proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts)
     - Y's lead projects: 0 projects
     - Intersection: empty set → n_actionable = 0
   - **Step 6 (Outcome Determination)**: Applied logic based on n_filtered and n_actionable
     - n_filtered = 1, n_actionable = 0
     - Outcome: 'denied_security' (single project found but Y is NOT Lead)
     - target_project_id set to proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts

3. **Fact Verification**: All data was verified from function returns:
   - X's projects retrieved via `search_projects(team_employee="6KR2_033")` → 4 projects
   - Y's lead projects retrieved via `search_projects(team_employee="6KR2_001", team_role="Lead")` → 0 projects
   - Project details verified via `get_project()` for each project
   - Exact match verified by comparing project_ref with project.name (case-insensitive)
   - All printed values match the function returns

4. **No State Changes**: Only read/search operations were performed. No update functions were called.

5. **No Assumptions**: All data came directly from function returns. No sensible defaults or invented data were used.

The results are consistent with the printed output from code execution. The algorithm correctly identified the target project but determined the current user cannot proceed due to not being the project Lead.
