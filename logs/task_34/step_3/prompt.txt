Step 3: Retrieve all projects where X (the resolved employee for "Schneider Jonas") is a team member, as required by Step 1 of the mandatory time logging algorithm.
Approach: Using the matched employee_id from Step 2, query the team_member table for all rows where team_member.employee_id equals this id (exact match). Join these results to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to obtain project names and basic metadata. If no rows are returned, the projects list will be empty. This step should only use exact matching on employee_id; any ambiguity in employee_id should be resolved in Step 2. Handle potential data issues (for example, duplicate memberships) by relying on the UNIQUE(project_id, employee_id) constraint in team_member. No fuzzy search is needed for ids in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
