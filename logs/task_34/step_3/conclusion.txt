I have successfully executed Step 3 to retrieve all projects where employee "Schneider Jonas" (resolved as ID 6KR2_033) is a team member. I followed the approach exactly as specified:

1. Used the exact employee_id "6KR2_033" from Step 2 (no fuzzy search needed for IDs in this step)
2. Queried the project system using `search_projects` with `team_employee="6KR2_033"` to find all projects where this employee is a team member
3. Retrieved 4 projects where employee 6KR2_033 is a team member
4. For verification, examined detailed project information for the first 3 projects using `get_project` to confirm team membership
5. All facts were verified from function returns (printed values), no assumptions were made
6. No state-changing operations were performed in this step

The results match exactly what was printed from the function calls.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
