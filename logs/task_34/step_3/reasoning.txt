We are executing Step 3: Retrieve all projects where the employee (matched in Step 2, ID 6KR2_033) is a team member.

Approach:
- Use the employee_id from Step 2: 6KR2_033
- We'll query the projects that have this employee as a team member.
- We can use `search_projects` with `team_employee` filter set to the employee_id.
- Alternatively, we can list all projects and filter, but that is inefficient. Using `search_projects` with the exact employee_id is the way.

Note: The function `search_projects` allows filtering by `team_employee` (exact match). We'll use that.

We need to handle pagination because the limit is 5 per page. We'll loop until we get all projects.

We are expected to output:
{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
  "projects": [
    {"project_id": "...", "project_name": "..."},
    ...
  ]
}

Let's code accordingly.

We have successfully retrieved all projects where employee 6KR2_033 (Jonas Schneider) is a team member.
 The search_projects function returned 4 projects, and we verified that the employee is indeed in the team of the first 3 projects.
 Since we only checked the first 3 for verification, we trust that the search_projects function correctly returned all projects where the employee is a team member.

 The expected output is an object with employee_id and a list of projects (each with project_id and project_name).

 Let's format the output accordingly.

We are executing Step 3 of the task. We have already retrieved the matched employee_id for "Schneider Jonas" from Step 2, which is "6KR2_033". Now we need to retrieve all projects where this employee is a team member.

We have already executed code to do this and printed the results. We found 4 projects. We also verified by checking the team members of the first 3 projects that employee 6KR2_033 is indeed in the team.

We must ensure that the JSON output contains only the data we printed and verified.

The expected output is:
{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
  "projects": [
    { "project_id": "...", "project_name": "..." },
    ...
  ]
}

We have the following from the code execution:

1. Employee ID: 6KR2_033 (confirmed by get_employee)
2. Projects found (4 in total):
   - Project ID: proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts, Name: Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade
   - Project ID: proj_machina_press_high_temp, Name: High-temperature coating for presses
   - Project ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining, Name: Hygienic tank lining series
   - Project ID: proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2, Name: Wall and ceiling coating phase 2

We have verified that in the first 3 projects, the employee is indeed in the team. We assume the same for the fourth project, but note that the step does not require verifying each project's team membership beyond the initial query. However, the initial query (search_projects with team_employee) should only return projects where the employee is a team member.

We have not performed any state-changing operations (only read operations). Therefore, we can proceed to output the JSON.

We must also note that the step says: "If no rows are returned, the projects list will be empty." We have rows, so we list them.

Thus, we can now produce the final answer and JSON.
