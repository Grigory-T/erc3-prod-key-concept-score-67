STEP 6 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 21:03:12

I have verified the execution of Step 6 and confirm all requirements were met:

1. **Step Execution**: I followed the exact approach specified in the step description:
   - Used the user profile and system_roles from Step 1
   - Used the employee_id for X from Step 2 (6KR2_033)
   - Used target_project_id and outcome from Step 5 (proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts, 'denied_security')

2. **Approach Implementation**:
   - **First check**: Since Step 5 outcome is not 'ok_answer' (it's 'denied_security'), I immediately set allowed = false as per the instruction
   - **Reason provided**: "Step 5 outcome is 'denied_security', not 'ok_answer'. Cannot proceed."
   - **Company rules check**: Not required because the first condition already failed (outcome not 'ok_answer')

3. **Fact Verification**: All data was verified from function returns:
   - Current user: Verified via `who_am_i()` → 6KR2_001
   - Target employee: Verified via `get_employee("6KR2_033")` → Jonas Schneider
   - Target project: Verified via `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")` → "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade"
   - Step 5 outcome: From previous step result → 'denied_security'
   - All printed values match the function returns

4. **No State Changes**: Only read operations were performed. No update functions were called.

5. **No Assumptions**: All data came directly from function returns. No sensible defaults or invented data were used.

The permission check correctly determined that the user cannot proceed due to the Step 5 outcome being 'denied_security', which takes precedence over any role-based permissions the user might have.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
  "target_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts",
  "action": "Create time entry for another employee with status 'approved'",
  "allowed": false,
  "reason": "Step 5 outcome is 'denied_security', not 'ok_answer'. Cannot proceed."
}
