Step 4: Retrieve all projects where Y (current user Valentina Rinaldi) is the Lead, corresponding to Step 4 of the mandatory time logging algorithm.
Approach: Using the user_id from Step 1, query the team_member table for rows with team_member.employee_id equal to this id and role = 'Lead'. Join these rows with the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to obtain the list of projects where the current user is designated as Lead. This step uses exact matching on identifiers and role values only (no fuzzy search needed), since we already have a definitive user_id from Step 1.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"lead_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["employee_id","lead_projects"]}
