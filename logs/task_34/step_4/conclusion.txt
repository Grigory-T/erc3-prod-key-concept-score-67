I have successfully executed Step 4 to retrieve all projects where the current user (Valentina Rinaldi, user_id 6KR2_001) is the Lead. I followed the approach exactly as specified:

1. Used the exact employee_id "6KR2_001" from Step 1
2. Queried the project system using `search_projects` with `team_employee="6KR2_001"` and `team_role='Lead'` to find all projects where this employee is designated as Lead (found 0 projects)
3. Double-checked by scanning all 36 projects in the system and examining their team membership - user 6KR2_001 is not a team member of any project with any role
4. All facts were verified from function returns (printed values), no assumptions were made
5. No state-changing operations were performed in this step

The results match exactly what was printed from the function calls. Valentina Rinaldi (ID 6KR2_001) is not listed as a team member (with any role, including Lead) on any project in the system.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_001",
  "lead_projects": []
}
