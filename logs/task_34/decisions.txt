DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:46:09
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 is fully completed and matches the plan's requirements: the session user (Valentina Rinaldi) is identified with all required properties (user_id, name, department, location, system_roles). There are no anomalous or missing results, and the data gathered will support accurate authorization and next step execution. No new issues, risks, or policy conflicts have emerged. According to the plan, the next step is to locate 'Schneider Jonas' in the employee table, which is both possible and expected. Thus, the plan remains valid and should proceed as originally written.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:51:24
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have been executed exactly as specified in the plan, with all expected results and output fields produced and matching requirements. The results confirm that the process is progressing as intended (current user identified with roles, matched target employee found with high confidence). There are no discrepancies, unexpected results, or blockers. The next logical action is to proceed with Step 3 as laid out in the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:52:43
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced expected and valid results according to the Original Plan. Authenticated user was successfully resolved; target employee was found with high confidence; all projects where the target employee is a member were successfully retrieved. No unexpected results, missing information, or errors have occurred. There is no indication a replan is needed: the defined workflow can continue as originally specified. The next step is to retrieve all projects where the current user is the Lead (Step 4).

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:57:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced results that match the original plan exactly. The plan is still valid with no unexpected results or inconsistencies. Employee X ('Schneider Jonas') has been located with high confidence, his relevant projects have been found, and the lead projects for Y (Valentina Rinaldi) have been retrieved. The next step is to carry out the mandatory project filtering and intersection as per Step 5 of the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:59:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have returned expected, correct, and relevant results per the Original Plan. Step 5 determined with certainty (due to company rules and precise matching) that the user is NOT the project Lead and thus cannot log time on behalf of Schneider Jonas for the approved status. According to the Original Plan, Step 6 must still be executed to perform the formal permission check (using the denial outcome from Step 5 as input), followed by Step 7 if allowed (which it will not be). There is no unexpected data, system malfunction, nor ambiguity requiring replanning. The process is proceeding exactly as designed, and the task cannot yet be marked as finalized or aborted. Strictly per instruction, continue to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:03:20
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
According to the original plan, Step 6 permission check resulted in 'allowed = false' due to the workflow outcome from Step 5 ('denied_security'), which means the user is not authorized to create an approved time entry for Schneider Jonas on this project. Step 7 proceeds only if Step 6 'allowed = true' and Step 5 outcome is 'ok_answer', which is not the case here. All task steps have executed correctly and precisely according to the plan. The final result is that the task cannot be completed due to company authorization restrictions, i.e., the current user is not project lead or otherwise allowed per mandatory policy. This is not an error or exceptional situation—it's the correct and planned outcome if the lead intersection is empty. Therefore, the task is complete, and the final answer is what happened: no time entry was created as permission was denied.
