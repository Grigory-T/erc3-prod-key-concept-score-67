Step 2: Locate the target employee X = "Schneider Jonas" in the employee table in order to log time on his behalf.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record for the person referred to as "Schneider Jonas". First attempt an exact match on employee.name with normalized formats (for example, "Jonas Schneider" vs "Schneider Jonas" by splitting and reordering). If no exact match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on employee.name and employee.email fields, accounting for potential misspellings, different order of first and last name, extra middle names, or special characters. Use a fuzzy comparison algorithm (for example, token sort ratio) to compute a confidence score for each candidate and select the highest confidence candidate above a reasonable threshold. Return the best matched employee_id and a ranked list of candidates with confidence scores; if no plausible match is found, matched_employee_id should be null.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"confidence":{"type":"number"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","matched_employee_id","confidence","candidates"]}
