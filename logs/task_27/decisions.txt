Time: 2025-12-09 20:21:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been fully and successfully completed, providing a correct understanding of the schema and relationship required for the next query. The task's original plan remains perfectly applicable and there are no surprises, errors, or missing data functions noted. The remaining steps are appropriate and feasible. Therefore, the best course is to proceed according to the original plan by moving to Step 2.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:23:56
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have proceeded exactly as described in the Original Plan, with expected results and no discrepancies. The next step (Step 3) is to retrieve the customer record using the already found 'customer_id_from_project' (cust_freshfoods). No unexpected results or issues have occurred, so there is no need to replan or abort. The plan is still valid and execution should continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:25:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The execution has followed the original plan exactly so far and has returned the expected results for every step. All information required to proceed is present. According to the plan, the next action is to check permissions for the user to read the primary contact email on the identified customer, before attempting to read and return the email itself. No unexpected issues or results have occurred, and all required data and lookups have been successful and as expected. Therefore, continue with Step 4.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:28:46
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have proceeded according to the original plan with no discrepancies or unexpected results. The previous step has confirmed, with supporting detail and compliance with company rules, that the user is allowed to access the needed data. The remaining plan step (step 5) is clearly defined and can be executed as planned to retrieve and return the primary contact email for the customer linked to the project. No problems or blockers have emerged, so the correct action is to continue.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:29:46
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed exactly as instructed. Data has been verified at each stage, permissions were correctly checked, and the requested final value (primary contact email) was obtained and returned. There are no remaining steps. The task's original goal—to provide the primary contact email for the project—has been fully met with verified data.
