We are given the project's customer_id from Step 2: "cust_freshfoods".
 Step 3: Retrieve the customer record linked to the located project via the customer_id field.
 Approach: Use the exact customer_id to get the customer record via get_customer(customer_id).
 If that fails, we will relax the search.

 However, note that we are expected to follow the exact approach: start with exact match on customer.id.

 Since we have the exact customer_id, we can directly call get_customer.

 But let's also note that the step says: "If, due to data inconsistencies, this exact lookup fails, apply the defined search strategy..."

 We'll do:
  1. Exact match by customer.id.
  2. If not found, then we can try to search by the customer_id string in customer.id and customer.name (partial matches).
  3. Then fuzzy and semantic if needed.

 However, since we are confident the project had a customer_id, we expect an exact match.

 Let's execute.

We are in Step 3. The exact match for customer ID "cust_freshfoods" was found.
 We have the customer object. We need to return the required JSON.

 However, note that the expected output requires:
   - customer_id_requested (the customer ID we were looking for)
   - customer_found (boolean)
   - customer_match_type (string)
   - customer_id (string, the actual customer ID found)
   - customer_name (string)

 We have:
   customer_id_requested = "cust_freshfoods"
   customer_found = True
   customer_match_type = "exact_id"
   customer_id = customer.id (which is "cust_freshfoods")
   customer_name = customer.name (which is "FreshFoods Processing")

 We must return these in the JSON.

 But note: the expected output does not require the full customer record, just the specified properties.

 Let's print the customer details to confirm and then construct the JSON.

We have successfully completed Step 3. The customer record was found via exact ID match. We have the required information.
 We must now provide the final answer in the specified JSON format.

The user asks for verification of the step. I need to confirm that I executed the step instruction properly.

Step 3: Retrieve the customer record linked to the located project via the customer_id field.

Approach: Using the 'customer_id_from_project' obtained from the located project record, query the 'customer' table by exact 'customer.id'. If fails, apply search strategy.

From Step 2 result, we have customer_id_from_project = "cust_freshfoods". I used that to query get_customer("cust_freshfoods") exactly. It succeeded, returning a customer. I printed the customer details.

I did not skip any action. I followed the exact approach: first exact match, which succeeded, so no need for partial/fuzzy/semantic matching. That's acceptable per the approach: "If, due to data inconsistencies, this exact lookup fails, apply the defined search strategy". Since it succeeded, we stop.

All facts were verified: I printed the customer ID and name from the function return.

I did not change any state; only read operations.

The JSON response contains values that were explicitly printed: customer_id_requested, customer_found, customer_match_type, customer_id, customer_name.

Thus step is complete.

I'll repeat the final answer and JSON blocks.
