Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly: using the customer_id "cust_freshfoods" from Step 2, I queried the customer table with an exact match on customer.id using get_customer("cust_freshfoods"). The exact lookup succeeded, returning the customer record. No relaxed searches were needed because the exact match worked. All facts (customer ID and name) were explicitly printed from the function return. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "customer_id_requested": "cust_freshfoods",
  "customer_found": true,
  "customer_match_type": "exact_id",
  "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
  "customer_name": "FreshFoods Processing"
}
