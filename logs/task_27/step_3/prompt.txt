Step 3: Retrieve the customer record linked to the located project via the customer_id field.
Approach: Using the 'customer_id_from_project' obtained from the located project record, query the 'customer' table by exact 'customer.id'. If, due to data inconsistencies, this exact lookup fails, apply the defined search strategy using the customer identifier or any available customer name from project.description or project.name: attempt partial matches on 'customer.id' and 'customer.name', and if still not found, apply FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to handle potential misspellings or slightly different naming. Confirm that exactly one customer record has been reliably identified.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id_requested":{"type":"string"},"customer_found":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_match_type":{"type":"string","description":"Type of match used for the customer, for example 'exact_id', 'partial_id', 'fuzzy_name', or 'semantic'."},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id_requested","customer_found"]}
