Step 5: If access is allowed, read and return the primary contact email for the customer associated with 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'.
Approach: Provided that the previous step confirmed 'read_primary_contact_email_allowed' is true, query the already-identified customer record (without changing any data) and read the value of 'customer.primary_contact_email'. Prepare the final answer that directly addresses the task by returning this email address, together with contextual identifiers such as the project id and customer id. If permissions are denied or required records were not found in earlier steps, instead prepare an appropriate status indicating 'denied_security' or 'not_found' without exposing any restricted data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"status":{"type":"string","description":"Overall outcome, for example 'ok_answer', 'not_found', or 'denied_security'."},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"primary_contact_email":{"type":"string"}},"required":["status"]}
