We are at Step 5. We have completed Step 4 and found that read_primary_contact_email_allowed is true.
 Therefore, we are allowed to read the primary contact email.

 In Step 2, we found the project and its customer ID: "cust_freshfoods".
 In Step 3, we retrieved the customer record and confirmed the customer ID and name.

 Now, we need to get the primary contact email from the customer record.

 Approach:
 1. We already have the customer ID, so we can call `get_customer` again to get the full customer record.
    However, note that in Step 3 we only retrieved the customer and printed the ID and name, but we didn't store the full record.
    We can either store the full customer object from Step 3 (but we didn't) or we can retrieve it again.

    Since the step says: "query the already-identified customer record", we can get it again.

 2. We must be cautious: the user might not have permission to read the email? But Step 4 said we are allowed.

 3. We'll get the customer by the exact ID we have: "cust_freshfoods".

 4. Then, we extract the `primary_contact_email` field.

 5. We then return the required JSON.

 However, note that the expected output requires:
   - status: "ok_answer" if we found the email, or "not_found" if the customer record doesn't exist or the email is missing, or "denied_security" if permissions are denied.

 Since Step 4 said we are allowed, we should not get "denied_security". But if the customer record is not found, we return "not_found".

 Let's proceed.

We have successfully retrieved the customer record and the primary contact email.
 The previous step confirmed that read access is allowed.
 We'll now prepare the final answer with the required JSON structure.

We are at Step 5. The previous step (Step 4) confirmed that read access is allowed for the user.
 We have the project ID and customer ID from previous steps.
 We need to retrieve the customer record and read the primary_contact_email.

 We already executed the code and got the email: claire.martin@freshfoods.com

 Let me double-check by ensuring the customer record is indeed the one linked to the project.
 Although we already have the customer ID from Step 2, let me verify the project again to be absolutely sure.

 However, the step instruction says: "query the already-identified customer record (without changing any data)"
 We have the customer ID from Step 3: cust_freshfoods.

 We did retrieve the customer and printed the email. Now, we must confirm that the project ID we are using is correct.

 Let me get the project again to confirm the customer ID.
 But note: the step says we already have the customer record identified. We are to read the email from that.

 We have two options:
   Option 1: Trust the previous steps and use the customer ID we have.
   Option 2: Re-fetch the project to double-check the customer ID.

 Since the step says "already-identified", I think we can use the customer ID from Step 3.

 However, to be thorough and avoid any inconsistency, let me quickly re-fetch the project and customer.

 But note: the user might have changed data in between? Unlikely, but we are to use the current state.

 Let me do:

 1. Get the project again to confirm the customer ID.
 2. Then get the customer again to confirm the email.

 However, we already did that in the code above and printed the email.

 But let me do it again in this verification step to be absolutely sure.

 We must be cautious: we are not changing data, just reading.

 Let me write a small verification code:
