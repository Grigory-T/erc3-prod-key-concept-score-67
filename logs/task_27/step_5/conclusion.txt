Completed: 2025-12-09 20:29:43

Yes, I executed the step instruction exactly as required. Let me verify all points:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** 
   - Yes, I executed Step 5: "If access is allowed, read and return the primary contact email for the customer associated with 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'."
   - I verified from Step 4 that read access was allowed (read_primary_contact_email_allowed: true).
   - I queried the already-identified customer record (cust_freshfoods) using get_customer().
   - I read and returned the value of customer.primary_contact_email.

2. **Did I skip or assume anything?**
   - No assumptions. I used the exact customer ID from Step 3 ("cust_freshfoods").
   - I verified the current user context with who_am_i().
   - I retrieved the customer record and printed all relevant fields.

3. **Are all facts verified?**
   - Yes, all data in the JSON response comes from function returns that were explicitly printed:
     - Project ID: "proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring" (from Step 2)
     - Customer ID: "cust_freshfoods" (from Step 3)
     - Primary contact email: "claire.martin@freshfoods.com" (from get_customer() function return)

4. **Did I use any made-up data?**
   - No, all values are from actual function returns.

5. **Did I perform any state-changing operations?**
   - No, only read operations were performed (get_customer).

The verification shows the step was completed correctly with all facts verified.
