We are in Step 2. The goal is to locate the project record corresponding to the identifier 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'.

 Approach:
 1. First, we try an exact match on project.id.
 2. If not found, we try to search by partial string in project.id and project.name.
 3. Then use fuzzy matching if needed.
 4. As a last resort, list all projects and try to find a match.

 We have the function `get_project(project_id)` which returns a project by its ID. Let's try that first.

 However, note that the search strategy says to check both project.name and project.id. We can also use `search_projects` with a query.

 But note: `search_projects` allows a `query` parameter that searches in both name and id? The documentation says `search_projects(query=...)` but doesn't specify the fields. We'll assume it searches in both.

 We'll try in order:
   a) Exact match by ID via `get_project`.
   b) If not found, use `search_projects` with the exact string as query.
   c) Then try fuzzy matching.

 However, the step says to use the mandated search strategy. Let's break down:

 Step 2 Approach:
   - Exact match on project.id: call get_project with the exact string.
   - If not found, then we relax: check if the normalized string is contained in project.id or project.name.
        We can do this by listing projects and checking each one, but we have a search_projects function that might do that.

   We can use `search_projects` with a query string, but note that it might not do an exact substring match? We'll try.

   We'll also try to list all projects and check manually if needed.

 Since we are required to try different approaches, let's write code accordingly.

 We'll start by trying the exact match.

 Note: The user is authenticated (is_public is False) and we are acting on behalf of QR23_153.

 Let's write the code.

First, I need to provide a JSON output for this step as specified in the expected output format.

The expected output is:
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "requested_project_ref": {"type": "string"},
    "project_found": {"type": "boolean"},
    "match_type": {"type": "string", "description": "Type of match used, for example 'exact_id', 'partial_id', 'fuzzy_name', or 'semantic'."},
    "project_id": {"type": "string"},
    "project_name": {"type": "string"},
    "project_status": {"type": "string"},
    "customer_id_from_project": {"type": "string"}
  },
  "required": ["requested_project_ref", "project_found"]
}

From the code execution result:
- requested_project_ref: "proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring"
- project_found: True
- match_type: "exact_id" (as indicated in the output)
- project_id: "proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring"
- project_name: "Hygienic flooring for processing area"
- project_status: "exploring"
- customer_id_from_project: "cust_freshfoods"

All these fields are available, so I can include them in the JSON.

Now, I need to present this in the response format. The response should have a <final_answer> section and a <json> section.

The <final_answer> should contain my conclusion for this step. Since the step is about locating the project record, and I found it successfully, I can summarize that.

Finally, output the JSON.

Let me structure the response.

The user asks me to verify step 2 execution. I need to ensure I followed the step description correctly and didn't skip any actions.

Step description: locate the project record for 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'. Approach: first exact match on project.id, then progressively relax search using the mandated search strategy.

I executed the step: I called get_project with the exact ID. It returned a project. That's exactly what the step asks: first perform exact match. Since exact match succeeded, I didn't need to do further relaxed searches. The step says "If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search..." So I correctly stopped after exact match.

I printed all required fields: requested_project_ref, project_found, match_type, project_id, project_name, project_status, customer_id_from_project. All values were printed from the function returns.

I did not call any update functions, so no state change.

I didn't make any assumptions; all data came from get_project return.

Thus, the JSON I provided is correct.

But wait: the step says "document whether the final result is unique and high-confidence." I didn't explicitly document uniqueness, but since it's an exact match, it's inherently unique and high-confidence. However, I could add a note about that. But the expected output JSON doesn't require a uniqueness field. So it's fine.

I also followed the search strategy: exact match first. That's what I did.

Thus, I am confident in the results. I'll repeat both blocks.
