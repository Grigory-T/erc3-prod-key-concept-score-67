Step 2: Locate the project record corresponding to the identifier 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring' in the project table.
Approach: Query the 'project' table to find the record for the project. First perform an exact match on 'project.id' using the literal value 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search using the mandated search strategy: check if the normalized search string (lowercased and whitespace-trimmed) is contained within 'project.id' or 'project.name'; then attempt fuzzy matching (for example fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) on 'project.id' and 'project.name' to handle potential typos or minor variations; and, if still unresolved, use broader FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over all project fields and, as a last resort, list projects and manually pick the closest match. Throughout, prioritize exact matches over fuzzy matches and document whether the final result is unique and high-confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"requested_project_ref":{"type":"string"},"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"match_type":{"type":"string","description":"Type of match used, for example 'exact_id', 'partial_id', 'fuzzy_name', or 'semantic'."},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"},"customer_id_from_project":{"type":"string"}},"required":["requested_project_ref","project_found"]}
