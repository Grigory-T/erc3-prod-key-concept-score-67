Step 2 completed successfully. I executed the exact match approach as instructed by first calling get_project('proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'), which returned the project record. Since an exact match was found, I did not need to proceed to relaxed searches. All data in the JSON response comes directly from the function return values printed during execution. No state-changing operations were performed.
