Step 1: Understand where the primary contact email for a project is stored in the data model and how it relates to the project identified as 'proj_freshfoods_hygienic_flooring'.
Approach: Review the available database schema and internal data model documentation for the customer and project entities to confirm that the primary contact email is stored in the 'customer.primary_contact_email' field and that projects link to customers via 'project.customer_id'. This is a direct inspection of the schema (no data access yet) to ensure that the later query sequence (project → customer → primary_contact_email) is correct.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"contact_email_source":{"type":"string","description":"Table and column where primary contact email is stored, for example 'customer.primary_contact_email'."},"project_to_customer_relation_confirmed":{"type":"boolean"},"relation_details":{"type":"string","description":"Human-readable explanation of how project records relate to customer records (for example via project.customer_id)."}},"required":["contact_email_source","project_to_customer_relation_confirmed"]}
