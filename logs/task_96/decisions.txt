DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:22:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was completed successfully – candidate customers and projects were clearly identified with high match scores according to the plan, explicitly fulfilling the required level of precision. The results provide a strong, non-ambiguous highest match: the project 'Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line' under customer 'BalkanMetal Fabrication'. There are no inconsistencies or missing data, nor any reason to replan. The next step is Step 2: confirm the current user identity, map their permissions, and check policy compliance for access to non-confidential project/team/skill data. This is a direct continuation as described in the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:25:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 2) successfully confirmed both the concrete project match and the authenticated user's permissions according to the Original Plan. The plan’s steps have produced expected, valid results so far, with no errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected findings. Therefore, there is no need to replan. There is no reason to abort, and the task is not yet complete because we do not have the required skills table. Next, as per the Original Plan, we should proceed to Step 3 to retrieve the team members for the specific project.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:26:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is being strictly followed and all completed steps have produced the expected results with no errors, missing information, or need for alternate logic. The output so far includes correctly identified project and team members and has verified compliance with company access and data policies. The next step (fetching team member skills via direct lookup) can be completed as planned, and there are no obstacles or deviations from the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:29:16
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have executed as intended, producing correct and relevant results at each stage strictly following the original plan. Each prerequisite fact is established via explicit function results. The next and final step (Step 5) is to aggregate the already gathered data into a consolidated table-format answer as specified by the original plan. There are no errors, missing data, or discrepancies requiring replanning. Therefore, the plan remains valid and should continue to the final aggregation/answer step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:34:18
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been completed successfully. Each step produced the expected results: the project and customer were correctly identified, permissions for data access were confirmed, the project team and their roles were retrieved, employee skills were accurately gathered and filtered, and finally, all results were consolidated into a complete skill table. No steps remain and the requested table is available. No errors, omissions, or needs for replanning were found.
