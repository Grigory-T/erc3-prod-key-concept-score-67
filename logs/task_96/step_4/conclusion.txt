STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed:

1. **Verified execution**: I used the exact employee_ids from Step 3 (BwFV_013 and BwFV_051) and queried the employee data using `get_employee()` which accesses the employee_skill table through the EmployeeFull object's `skills` field.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I filtered for skills only (excluding wills) by using `employee.skills` (wills are in a separate `wills` field)
   - I used exact matching on employee_id
   - I retrieved skill_name and level for each skill
   - I did not query or expose any salary or notes fields
   - I built the collection mapping employee_id to skills list

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Printed exact skill names and levels from `get_employee()` returns
   - Verified employee names match Step 3 data
   - Confirmed no sensitive fields (salary, notes) were accessed
   - All data in JSON comes directly from printed function outputs

4. **No state changes**: Only read operations were performed using `get_employee()` - no update functions were called.

The approach correctly implements querying the employee_skill table (via the employee object) and filtering by skill_type='skill' (by using the `skills` field which already excludes wills).
