We are given the project_id from previous steps: "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer".
 We need to get the project team and then for each team member, get their employee details (name, email).
 Approach:
 1. Get the project by ID to get the team list (which is a list of TeamMember objects).
 2. For each team member in the team, we have the employee ID, time_slice, and role.
 3. We then need to get the employee details (name, email) for each employee ID.
 4. Compile the list of team members with the required fields.

 Note: The function get_project(project_id) returns a ProjectFull object, which has a team field (list of TeamMember).
 The TeamMember object has: employee (str), time_slice (float), role (str).

 We'll use get_employee(employee_id) to get the employee's name and email.

 Steps in code:
   project = get_project("proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer")
   If project is None, then project does not exist. But from previous step we know it exists.
   team_members = []
   for tm in project.team:
        emp = get_employee(tm.employee)
        if emp:
            team_members.append({
                "employee_id": tm.employee,
                "employee_name": emp.name,
                "email": emp.email,
                "role": tm.role,
                "time_slice": tm.time_slice
            })

 5. Return the result in the expected format.

 However, note that the expected output requires:
   - project_id (string)
   - team_members (list of objects, each with employee_id, employee_name, email, role, time_slice)

 6. We must also consider that the employee email might be None? But we can get it from the employee object.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

We have successfully retrieved the project and its team members.
 Now we need to format the output as per the expected JSON structure.
 The output should include project_id and team_members array.
 We have two team members, each with employee_id, employee_name, email, role, and time_slice.
 Note: The expected output requires employee_id, employee_name, and role as required fields.
 We have all these for each team member.

 Let's create the JSON accordingly.

[REASONING #9] 2025-12-10 00:26:42
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are given the project_id from previous step: "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer"
 We have already retrieved the project and its team members.
 The code executed successfully and printed the team members.
 We have two team members: BwFV_013 and BwFV_051, with their roles and time slices.
 We also retrieved their names and emails from the employee table.

 However, note that the expected output requires the following for each team member:
   - employee_id (string)
   - employee_name (string)
   - email (string)
   - role (string)
   - time_slice (number)

 We have all these for both team members.

 Let's double-check that we didn't miss any team members by checking if the project team list is complete.
 The project.team list from get_project() should be the authoritative source for team members.

 We have printed that there are 2 team members, and we processed both.

 The output JSON should be as per the expected output.

 We are not changing any state, just reading.

 Let's ensure that the email field is correctly obtained. In our code, we used employee.email.

 Also, note that the role in the project is from the team_member.role, which is already a string.

 We have verified the data by printing it.

 Therefore, the JSON we provided is correct.

 However, let's note that the expected output does not require the email to be present? Actually it does: 
   the properties include "email" of type string, but the required fields are only employee_id, employee_name, and role.
   We have email, so we include it.

 We are confident.

 We will repeat the final answer and JSON blocks.
