Step 3: Retrieve all team members associated with the identified zinc-rich primer project from the team_member and employee tables.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and a single concrete project_id has been determined, query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id equals that project_id using an exact match on project_id. For each team_member row, join to the employee table on employee.id = team_member.employee_id to fetch the employee's name and email. Because employee_id and project_id are exact keys, do not alter them, but when displaying or further processing names, be aware that they can contain minor inconsistencies; however, no fuzzy logic is needed for this join. Return a structured list of all team members including employee_id, employee_name, email, their role on the project (Lead, Engineer, Designer, Quality Assurance, Operations, Other), and time_slice. If there are no team members, return an empty list but still include the project_id in the result.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","role"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}
