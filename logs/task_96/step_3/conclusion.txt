I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I queried the team_member table by getting the project with ID "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer" using an exact match, then for each team member in the project.team list, I joined to the employee table using get_employee() to fetch the employee's name and email. All facts were explicitly verified from function returns: the project exists, has 2 team members, and both employees were found in the employee registry with their details. No assumptions were made, no fuzzy logic was needed as the keys are exact, and no state-changing operations were performed. All data in the JSON comes directly from printed function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
  "team_members": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_013",
      "employee_name": "Antonio Esposito",
      "email": "BwFV_013@bellini.internal",
      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_051",
      "employee_name": "Emanuele Sartori",
      "email": "BwFV_051@bellini.internal",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
