Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions for Antonio Esposito to access project team and skill data for the selected project.
Approach: Using the bound identity from the EmployeeRegistry (employee table), perform a who_am_i check for user id "BwFV_013" to confirm the employee record (name, department, location) and derive system roles (for example, 'SalesUser', 'R&DUser') from the appropriate role-mapping source. Once a specific target project_id has been selected from Step 1 (for example, by choosing the highest-confidence unambiguous match, or by requiring user clarification if multiple candidates are similarly likely), evaluate access restrictions according to company rules: this task only reads project, team_member, and employee_skill data and does not touch salary or HR notes, so check that the user's department and system_roles allow read-only access to these tables. Explicitly verify that no restricted fields such as salary or confidential HR notes are queried. Return whether Antonio is allowed to read project membership and skills for the chosen project, with a clear reason string. If project_id is still ambiguous at execution time, mark can_access as false and reason as requiring project clarification rather than a security denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"can_access":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_access","reason"]}
