I have executed the step instruction by verifying the current user identity through `who_am_i()` and confirming the selected project exists via `get_project()`. The user Antonio Esposito (BwFV_013) is authenticated, belongs to Sales & Customer Success, and is not a public user. The target project "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer" exists and is the highest-confidence match from Step 1. According to company rules, authenticated users can read project data and, via chatbot access, can view context-relevant subsets of employee skills and wills. This task only involves reading project team membership and employee skills—no sensitive fields (salary, HR notes) are accessed. Therefore, the user has permission to access the requested data. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_013",
  "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
  "can_access": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and has read access to project team and employee skills via chatbot; no restricted fields are accessed."
}
