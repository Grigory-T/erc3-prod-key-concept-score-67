Step 1: Identify the target project record(s) corresponding to the "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal" in the project and customer tables.
Approach: Query the customer table first to find candidate customers whose name matches the literal string "BalkanMetal" using an exact match; if not found, progressively relax the search by checking if the lowercased, whitespace-normalized query string is contained in customer.name, then by using fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical similarity search to account for typos, partial words, and minor name variations (for example, "Balkan Metal", "Balkan Metals"). Next, query the project table to find candidate projects whose name or description matches the literal phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal" using an exact match first; if not found, relax the search by checking for substrings such as "zinc-rich primer", "primer fabrication", and by combining project and customer matches (for example, project.customer_id equals a matched BalkanMetal customer id). Use fuzzy matching, partial matching, regular expressions, and semantic or logical search over project.name and project.description to handle possible misspellings or wording differences, always preferring exact and higher-confidence matches. Collect all matching customers and projects along with a numeric match score indicating confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","customer_id","match_score"]}}},"required":["project_candidates"]}
