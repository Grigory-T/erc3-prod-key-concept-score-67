Step 5: Aggregate the retrieved data into a consolidated table of all skills in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal.
Approach: Combine the project information from Step 1, the team members from Step 3, and the skills data from Step 4 into a single tabular structure. For each employee in the project team, create one row per skill containing at least: project_id, project_name (from the chosen project candidate), skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, the numeric level, and, if available, the role of the employee on the project. Optionally de-duplicate rows only if exact duplicates of (employee_id, skill_name, level, role) are encountered; otherwise keep one row per employee-skill combination. The resulting structure should be ready to render as a human-readable table (for example, a markdown table) for the user. Ensure that only skill-related data and non-sensitive employee identifiers are included in the table, with no salary or HR notes.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"skills_table":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["skill_name","employee_id","employee_name","level"]}}},"required":["skills_table"]}
