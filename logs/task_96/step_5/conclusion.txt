STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:34:03

I have verified the execution of Step 5. All requirements were met:

1. **Step executed correctly**: I combined project information from Step 1, team members from Step 3, and skills data from Step 4 into a single tabular structure.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project ID and name from function returns (`get_project()`)
   - Used the exact team member data from Step 3 (verified through project team listing)
   - Used the exact skills data from Step 4 (verified through employee records)
   - Created one row per employee-skill combination (30 total rows)
   - Checked for and found no duplicate rows
   - Included all required fields: skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, level, and role

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Project ID and name: Printed from `get_project()` return
   - Team members: Verified from project.team list
   - Skills: Verified from `get_employee()` returns for both employees
   - No sensitive data (salary, HR notes) included
   - All data in JSON comes directly from printed function outputs

4. **No state changes**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The resulting table is ready to render as a human-readable table with all skills in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal.
