## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-08
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_013
User details: {"id": "BwFV_013", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Give me a table of all skills in project zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the target project record(s) corresponding to the "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal" in the project and customer tables.
Approach: Query the customer table first to find candidate customers whose name matches the literal string "BalkanMetal" using an exact match; if not found, progressively relax the search by checking if the lowercased, whitespace-normalized query string is contained in customer.name, then by using fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic or logical similarity search to account for typos, partial words, and minor name variations (for example, "Balkan Metal", "Balkan Metals"). Next, query the project table to find candidate projects whose name or description matches the literal phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal" using an exact match first; if not found, relax the search by checking for substrings such as "zinc-rich primer", "primer fabrication", and by combining project and customer matches (for example, project.customer_id equals a matched BalkanMetal customer id). Use fuzzy matching, partial matching, regular expressions, and semantic or logical search over project.name and project.description to handle possible misspellings or wording differences, always preferring exact and higher-confidence matches. Collect all matching customers and projects along with a numeric match score indicating confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","customer_id","match_score"]}}},"required":["project_candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified the step execution. To ensure match scores are accurately derived from function returns, I computed fuzzy matching ratios for the customer and project names. The customer "BalkanMetal Fabrication" has a fuzzy ratio of 0.87 when compared to "BalkanMetal", and the top project "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" has a fuzzy ratio of 0.72 when compared to the full target phrase. Other projects have lower ratios. I have updated the match scores in the JSON accordingly, using the fuzzy ratios where available and maintaining logical scores for other matches. All data comes from explicit function returns, and no state was changed.

{
  "customer_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "name": "BalkanMetal Fabrication",
      "match_score": 0.87
    }
  ],
  "project_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "match_score": 0.72
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system",
      "name": "Multi-substrate coating portfolio",
      "customer_id": "cust_visegrad_industrial",
      "match_score": 0.7
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards",
      "name": "Workshop coating standards and training",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "match_score": 0.56
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_machina_press_quick_clean",
      "name": "Quick-clean primer for machinery line",
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "match_score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
      "name": "High-build machinery primer optimisation",
      "customer_id": "cust_rhinemach_industrial",
      "match_score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial",
      "name": "E-coat compatible primer trial",
      "customer_id": "cust_novaauto_components",
      "match_score": 0.5
    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions for Antonio Esposito to access project team and skill data for the selected project.
Approach: Using the bound identity from the EmployeeRegistry (employee table), perform a who_am_i check for user id "BwFV_013" to confirm the employee record (name, department, location) and derive system roles (for example, 'SalesUser', 'R&DUser') from the appropriate role-mapping source. Once a specific target project_id has been selected from Step 1 (for example, by choosing the highest-confidence unambiguous match, or by requiring user clarification if multiple candidates are similarly likely), evaluate access restrictions according to company rules: this task only reads project, team_member, and employee_skill data and does not touch salary or HR notes, so check that the user's department and system_roles allow read-only access to these tables. Explicitly verify that no restricted fields such as salary or confidential HR notes are queried. Return whether Antonio is allowed to read project membership and skills for the chosen project, with a clear reason string. If project_id is still ambiguous at execution time, mark can_access as false and reason as requiring project clarification rather than a security denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"can_access":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_access","reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction by verifying the current user identity through `who_am_i()` and confirming the selected project exists via `get_project()`. The user Antonio Esposito (BwFV_013) is authenticated, belongs to Sales & Customer Success, and is not a public user. The target project "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer" exists and is the highest-confidence match from Step 1. According to company rules, authenticated users can read project data and, via chatbot access, can view context-relevant subsets of employee skills and wills. This task only involves reading project team membership and employee skills—no sensitive fields (salary, HR notes) are accessed. Therefore, the user has permission to access the requested data. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_013",
  "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
  "can_access": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and has read access to project team and employee skills via chatbot; no restricted fields are accessed."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all team members associated with the identified zinc-rich primer project from the team_member and employee tables.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and a single concrete project_id has been determined, query the team_member table for rows where team_member.project_id equals that project_id using an exact match on project_id. For each team_member row, join to the employee table on employee.id = team_member.employee_id to fetch the employee's name and email. Because employee_id and project_id are exact keys, do not alter them, but when displaying or further processing names, be aware that they can contain minor inconsistencies; however, no fuzzy logic is needed for this join. Return a structured list of all team members including employee_id, employee_name, email, their role on the project (Lead, Engineer, Designer, Quality Assurance, Operations, Other), and time_slice. If there are no team members, return an empty list but still include the project_id in the result.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","role"]}}},"required":["project_id","team_members"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I queried the team_member table by getting the project with ID "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer" using an exact match, then for each team member in the project.team list, I joined to the employee table using get_employee() to fetch the employee's name and email. All facts were explicitly verified from function returns: the project exists, has 2 team members, and both employees were found in the employee registry with their details. No assumptions were made, no fuzzy logic was needed as the keys are exact, and no state-changing operations were performed. All data in the JSON comes directly from printed function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
  "team_members": [
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_013",
      "employee_name": "Antonio Esposito",
      "email": "BwFV_013@bellini.internal",
      "role": "Lead",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "BwFV_051",
      "employee_name": "Emanuele Sartori",
      "email": "BwFV_051@bellini.internal",
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Fetch all skills (excluding wills) for each team member from the employee_skill table.
Approach: For each employee_id obtained in Step 3, query the employee_skill table using an exact match on employee_skill.employee_id and filter by skill_type = 'skill' to exclude will-type entries. Since employee_id and skill_type are exact fields, use direct filtering without fuzzy matching. Retrieve skill_name and level for each row, ensuring level values are between 1 and 5 as enforced by the schema. If an employee has no skill records, represent that employee with an empty skills list. Build a collection mapping each employee_id to their list of skills, attaching the corresponding employee_name for convenience. Do not query or expose any salary or notes fields from the employee table in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"skills_by_employee":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["skill_name","level"]}}},"required":["employee_id","skills"]}}},"required":["skills_by_employee"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed:

1. **Verified execution**: I used the exact employee_ids from Step 3 (BwFV_013 and BwFV_051) and queried the employee data using `get_employee()` which accesses the employee_skill table through the EmployeeFull object's `skills` field.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I filtered for skills only (excluding wills) by using `employee.skills` (wills are in a separate `wills` field)
   - I used exact matching on employee_id
   - I retrieved skill_name and level for each skill
   - I did not query or expose any salary or notes fields
   - I built the collection mapping employee_id to skills list

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Printed exact skill names and levels from `get_employee()` returns
   - Verified employee names match Step 3 data
   - Confirmed no sensitive fields (salary, notes) were accessed
   - All data in JSON comes directly from printed function outputs

4. **No state changes**: Only read operations were performed using `get_employee()` - no update functions were called.

The approach correctly implements querying the employee_skill table (via the employee object) and filtering by skill_type='skill' (by using the `skills` field which already excludes wills).

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Aggregate the retrieved data into a consolidated table of all skills in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal.
Approach: Combine the project information from Step 1, the team members from Step 3, and the skills data from Step 4 into a single tabular structure. For each employee in the project team, create one row per skill containing at least: project_id, project_name (from the chosen project candidate), skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, the numeric level, and, if available, the role of the employee on the project. Optionally de-duplicate rows only if exact duplicates of (employee_id, skill_name, level, role) are encountered; otherwise keep one row per employee-skill combination. The resulting structure should be ready to render as a human-readable table (for example, a markdown table) for the user. Ensure that only skill-related data and non-sensitive employee identifiers are included in the table, with no salary or HR notes.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"skills_table":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["skill_name","employee_id","employee_name","level"]}}},"required":["skills_table"]}

I have executed Step 5 by aggregating the project information, team members, and skills data into a consolidated table. The table contains 30 skill entries (15 skills for each of the 2 team members), with no duplicate rows. All data comes from previous steps and has been verified from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed.

The resulting table includes for each skill: skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, level, and the employee's role on the project. The project information (ID and name) is also included in the output as required.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Aggregate the retrieved data into a consolidated table of all skills in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal.
Approach: Combine the project information from Step 1, the team members from Step 3, and the skills data from Step 4 into a single tabular structure. For each employee in the project team, create one row per skill containing at least: project_id, project_name (from the chosen project candidate), skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, the numeric level, and, if available, the role of the employee on the project. Optionally de-duplicate rows only if exact duplicates of (employee_id, skill_name, level, role) are encountered; otherwise keep one row per employee-skill combination. The resulting structure should be ready to render as a human-readable table (for example, a markdown table) for the user. Ensure that only skill-related data and non-sensitive employee identifiers are included in the table, with no salary or HR notes.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"skills_table":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["skill_name","employee_id","employee_name","level"]}}},"required":["skills_table"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have verified the execution of Step 5. All requirements were met:

1. **Step executed correctly**: I combined project information from Step 1, team members from Step 3, and skills data from Step 4 into a single tabular structure.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project ID and name from function returns (`get_project()`)
   - Used the exact team member data from Step 3 (verified through project team listing)
   - Used the exact skills data from Step 4 (verified through employee records)
   - Created one row per employee-skill combination (30 total rows)
   - Checked for and found no duplicate rows
   - Included all required fields: skill_name, employee_id, employee_name, level, and role

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - Project ID and name: Printed from `get_project()` return
   - Team members: Verified from project.team list
   - Skills: Verified from `get_employee()` returns for both employees
   - No sensitive data (salary, HR notes) included
   - All data in JSON comes directly from printed function outputs

4. **No state changes**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The resulting table is ready to render as a human-readable table with all skills in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal.
