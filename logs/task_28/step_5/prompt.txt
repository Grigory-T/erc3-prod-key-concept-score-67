Step 5: Retrieve the customer associated with the uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' and prepare the final answer.
Approach: If Step 2 confirmed an implementation and Step 4 indicates that Laurent Pons has read permissions, and if Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate, use that project_id to query the project table for its customer_id. Then query the customer table for that customer_id to obtain the customer name (and optionally other non-sensitive metadata). If there are zero candidates or multiple equally plausible candidates from Step 3, or if implementation was not found in Step 2, or permissions are denied in Step 4, set appropriate flags to indicate that the customer cannot be determined or access is denied, without fabricating information.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"resolved":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"access_denied":{"type":"boolean"},"not_implemented":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["resolved","multiple_candidates","access_denied","not_implemented"]}
