We are now at Step 5.
 We have from previous steps:
   - Step 2: Implementation found (true) and we know how to access project and customer data.
   - Step 3: We have a list of candidate projects. The top candidate is "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation" with match_score 0.71.
   - Step 4: The user (Laurent Pons) has read permissions for both projects and customers.

 We need to check if there is exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate.

 Looking at the candidates from Step 3, we have 15 candidates. However, note that the match scores are provided.
 The top candidate has a score of 0.71, the next one is 0.49. There's a significant gap.

 We must decide if we have a unique best candidate. We'll consider the top candidate as the best match.

 Steps:
   1. Get the project_id of the top candidate: "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
   2. Retrieve the full project details using get_project(project_id)
   3. From the project, get the customer_id.
   4. Retrieve the customer details using get_customer(customer_id)
   5. Extract the customer name.

 However, note that the project might be linked to a customer by customer_id. We must verify.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll also consider the possibility of multiple equally plausible candidates? But the scores are not equal.

 We'll set:
   - resolved: true if we can get a unique customer, false otherwise.
   - multiple_candidates: true if we have more than one candidate with the same top score? But here only one top.

 Let's proceed.

 Important: We must print the results of each step.

 We'll also check the project status to see if it's paused? The task is about a paused project. We should verify.

 But note: The step description does not require us to check the status again. However, the task is about a paused project.

 We can check the project status and if it's not paused, then we might need to reconsider.

 However, the step says "uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems'". We assume the top candidate is the one.

 Let's first get the project and see its status.

 We'll do:

   project = get_project("proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation")

   If project is None, then we cannot resolve.

   Then, get customer_id from project.customer.

   Then, customer = get_customer(project.customer)

   Then, we have the customer name.

 Let's code.

We have successfully retrieved the project and customer details.
 The project is indeed paused, and the customer is Machina Press Systems.
 Since we have exactly one clear candidate (the top one from Step 3) and we have read permissions (Step 4) and implementation is found (Step 2), we can proceed.
 We'll set the output accordingly.

We need to verify that the step was executed correctly according to the checklist and that all facts are verified.

 Let's review:

 Step 5 Approach:
 - Step 2 confirmed implementation (yes, found)
 - Step 4 indicated read permissions (yes, can read projects and customers)
 - Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate? We have a list of 15 candidates, but the top candidate has a match_score of 0.71 and the next is 0.49, so it's clearly the best.

 We used the top candidate: proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation.

 We then:
  1. Queried the project table for that project_id -> got project with customer_id = cust_machina_press
  2. Queried the customer table for that customer_id -> got customer with name = Machina Press Systems

 All facts were printed from function returns.

 The JSON output must contain:
   resolved: true (because we successfully retrieved the customer)
   project_id, project_name, customer_id, customer_name: as printed
   multiple_candidates: false? But note: Step 3 had 15 candidates, but the step says "if Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate". We have a clear best match (0.71 vs 0.49). However, the existence of other candidates does not necessarily mean multiple equally plausible candidates. The top candidate is clearly the best. So multiple_candidates should be false.

   access_denied: false (we were able to read both project and customer)
   not_implemented: false (Step 2 found implementation)

 Let's double-check the candidate list from Step 3: The top candidate is the only one that contains "coating rationalisation" and is for the customer Machina Press Systems. The others are different projects.

 Also, we should note that the project status is 'paused', which matches the task description.

 Therefore, the JSON we provided is correct.

 However, let's verify that we didn't miss any other possible project that might be equally plausible.

 We can quickly check the other candidates with higher match scores? Actually, the second candidate has 0.49, which is significantly lower. Also, we know from Step 3 that the top candidate is the only one that contains "coating rationalisation" and is associated with the customer Machina Press Systems.

 But note: the project name is "Press line coating rationalisation", which is a variation of "coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems". The customer is Machina Press Systems. So it's a perfect match.

 Let's also verify that the customer name is exactly "Machina Press Systems" as printed.

 We printed:
   Customer name: Machina Press Systems

 So all good.

 We did not change any state, so no state-changing operations were performed.

 Therefore, we are confident.

 We'll repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
