## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-04-03
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_024
User details: {"id": "6KR2_024", "name": "Laurent Pons", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "Paris Office \u2013 France"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who is customer for paused coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify domain-specific terms and project naming conventions related to 'coating rationalisation' and 'Machina Press Systems' using internal wiki or documentation.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in the wiki_file table (and any internal documentation index if available) for terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases. Account explicitly for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names using fuzzy matching, partial string matching, and semantic similarity. Use these findings to better understand whether 'Machina Press Systems' is typically a customer name, a project name component, or an internal codename, and capture any canonical spellings or abbreviations.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"wiki_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}}},"required":["wiki_entries"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by performing an extensive fuzzy and semantic search across all internal wiki files. The search covered the exact terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases, accounting for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names. All findings are based directly on function returns from the search operations, with no assumptions or made-up data.

Key findings from the search:
- "MachinaPress" appears in the CRM documentation (systems/crm.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.75, suggesting this is likely a customer name format used internally.
- "Machina Press Systems" appears in marketing context (business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.71.
- "rationalisation" appears in company history (company/history.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.73, but not specifically linked to coatings.
- No exact matches were found for "coating rationalisation" or "coating rationalization" in any wiki file.
- Project naming conventions are documented in systems/project_registry.md, with examples of coating-related projects.

Based on these findings, "Machina Press Systems" appears to be a customer name rather than a project name component, and "coating rationalisation" is not a documented project type in the wiki, though it could be a specific project description.

    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records to answer questions about project customers.
Approach: Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms (for example, SQL tables, APIs, or services). Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data. Verify accessible interfaces (for example direct SQL query layer or an internal service) that can be used to read from these tables. If no such technical mechanism is available, this will be used later to justify aborting the task as not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_storage":{"type":"string"},"customer_storage":{"type":"string"},"access_method":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_storage","customer_storage","implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 by thoroughly executing the required fuzzy and semantic/logical search across all available system architecture documentation. I examined wiki files, performed targeted searches for storage mechanisms, and verified all facts directly from function returns. The search confirmed that project records are stored in the Project Registry system and customer records in the CRM system, both built on the legacy Progress OpenEdge database technology. Access is provided through a chatbot API wrapper that exposes functions for reading and writing to these systems. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "project_storage": "Project Registry system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "customer_storage": "CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "access_method": "Chatbot API wrapper providing functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.) to interact with legacy systems via APIs",
  "implementation_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using a tiered search strategy. First attempt exact match filters on the name field for phrases like 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' (normalized to lowercase and trimmed). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the criteria: (1) check if normalized substrings such as 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', and 'machina press systems' are contained in the project.name or project.description using lowercase, whitespace-stripped comparisons; (2) apply regular expressions or partial-word matches; (3) use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to compare the query phrase against project.name and project.description, including tolerance for misspellings, swapped word order, and abbreviations. Return a list of candidate projects with their identifiers, names, and match scores, clearly indicating if zero, one, or multiple candidates were found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","match_score"]}},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["candidates","candidate_count"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 by executing the exact tiered search strategy as specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search followed this precise approach:

1. **Exact match filters**: Searched for the full phrase "coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems" - returned 0 projects
2. **Normalized substring checks**: 
   - "coating rationalisation" in project.name: found 1 project (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation)
   - "coating rationalization" in project.name: found 0 projects  
   - "machina press systems" in project.name: found 0 projects (but found in customer records)
3. **Customer verification**: Found customer "Machina Press Systems" (cust_machina_press) and searched projects by customer ID
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy comparison of target phrases against all project names, generating match scores
5. **Description verification**: For top candidates, loaded full project details to check descriptions
6. **Status checking**: Verified project statuses, particularly looking for "paused" projects

All 15 candidate projects and their match scores were derived directly from function returns. The top candidate (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation) has the highest match score (0.71) and matches all key criteria: contains "coating rationalisation" in name, associated with customer "Machina Press Systems", and has status "paused".

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "project_name": "Press line coating rationalisation", "match_score": 0.71},

### Step 4
Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user Laurent Pons to read project and associated customer information for the identified candidate projects.
Approach: Using who_am_i() or equivalent identity introspection, confirm the current user details (employee id 6KR2_024, department Sales and Customer Success, location Paris Office – France) and derive system roles or access flags. Based on company rules, evaluate whether this user is allowed to READ (not modify) records from the project and customer data sources identified in Step 2. This check should be done generically for read-only access to the candidate projects from Step 3 and their linked customers, without adding extra rules beyond those specified. Output explicit booleans indicating whether reading project metadata and reading customer metadata is permitted; if reading is not permitted, this will later lead to a security-based denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_read_projects","can_read_customers"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been completed by verifying the current user context and analyzing company rules for read access permissions. The user Laurent Pons (ID: 6KR2_024) is authenticated and belongs to the Sales & Customer Success department. Based on the provided company rules, there are no explicit restrictions on reading project or customer metadata for authenticated employees. Specifically, the rule regarding CRM mutations states that "Other roles may read CRM where allowed," indicating read access to customer data is permitted. For projects, no read restrictions are mentioned. Therefore, the user has permission to read both project and customer information.

All facts were derived from the who_am_i() function and the provided company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "6KR2_024",
  "can_read_projects": true,
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "reason": "Authenticated employees have read access to project and customer metadata; no explicit read restrictions found in company rules for these resources, and CRM rules explicitly allow other roles to read CRM."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Retrieve the customer associated with the uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' and prepare the final answer.
Approach: If Step 2 confirmed an implementation and Step 4 indicates that Laurent Pons has read permissions, and if Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate, use that project_id to query the project table for its customer_id. Then query the customer table for that customer_id to obtain the customer name (and optionally other non-sensitive metadata). If there are zero candidates or multiple equally plausible candidates from Step 3, or if implementation was not found in Step 2, or permissions are denied in Step 4, set appropriate flags to indicate that the customer cannot be determined or access is denied, without fabricating information.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"resolved":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"access_denied":{"type":"boolean"},"not_implemented":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["resolved","multiple_candidates","access_denied","not_implemented"]}

Based on the executed code, I have successfully retrieved the customer associated with the uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems'. The project "Press line coating rationalisation" (ID: proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation) is indeed paused and is associated with customer "Machina Press Systems" (ID: cust_machina_press).

<final_answer>
I have completed Step 5 by retrieving the customer associated with the paused coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems. The project was uniquely identified in Step 3, and based on the user's permissions (verified in Step 4) and available implementation (confirmed in Step 2), I was able to access both the project and customer records. The project is confirmed to be paused, and its customer is Machina Press Systems.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have completed Step 5 by executing the exact approach specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. Here's what was verified:

1. **Step 2 implementation confirmed**: Yes (from Step 2 result)
2. **Step 4 permissions confirmed**: Yes, user can read projects and customers (from Step 4 result)
3. **Step 3 candidate verification**: There was one clearly best-matching candidate with match_score 0.71 (next best was 0.49), so we used project_id "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
4. **Project retrieval**: Successfully retrieved project with customer_id "cust_machina_press"
5. **Customer retrieval**: Successfully retrieved customer with name "Machina Press Systems"
6. **Project status verification**: Confirmed the project is "paused" as specified in the task

No state-changing operations were performed. All data comes directly from function returns.
