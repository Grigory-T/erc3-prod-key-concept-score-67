Completed: 2025-12-09 20:43:40

I have completed Step 5 by executing the exact approach specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. Here's what was verified:

1. **Step 2 implementation confirmed**: Yes (from Step 2 result)
2. **Step 4 permissions confirmed**: Yes, user can read projects and customers (from Step 4 result)
3. **Step 3 candidate verification**: There was one clearly best-matching candidate with match_score 0.71 (next best was 0.49), so we used project_id "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
4. **Project retrieval**: Successfully retrieved project with customer_id "cust_machina_press"
5. **Customer retrieval**: Successfully retrieved customer with name "Machina Press Systems"
6. **Project status verification**: Confirmed the project is "paused" as specified in the task

No state-changing operations were performed. All data comes directly from function returns.
