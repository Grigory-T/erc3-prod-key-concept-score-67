STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

I have completed Step 1 by performing an extensive fuzzy and semantic search across all internal wiki files. The search covered the exact terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases, accounting for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names. All findings are based directly on function returns from the search operations, with no assumptions or made-up data.

Key findings from the search:
- "MachinaPress" appears in the CRM documentation (systems/crm.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.75, suggesting this is likely a customer name format used internally.
- "Machina Press Systems" appears in marketing context (business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.71.
- "rationalisation" appears in company history (company/history.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.73, but not specifically linked to coatings.
- No exact matches were found for "coating rationalisation" or "coating rationalization" in any wiki file.
- Project naming conventions are documented in systems/project_registry.md, with examples of coating-related projects.

Based on these findings, "Machina Press Systems" appears to be a customer name rather than a project name component, and "coating rationalisation" is not a documented project type in the wiki, though it could be a specific project description.
