## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify domain-specific terms and project naming conventions related to 'coating rationalisation' and 'Machina Press Systems' using internal wiki or documentation.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in the wiki_file table (and any internal documentation index if available) for terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases. Account explicitly for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names using fuzzy matching, partial string matching, and semantic similarity. Use these findings to better understand whether 'Machina Press Systems' is typically a customer name, a project name component, or an internal codename, and capture any canonical spellings or abbreviations.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"wiki_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}}},"required":["wiki_entries"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by performing an extensive fuzzy and semantic search across all internal wiki files. The search covered the exact terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases, accounting for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names. All findings are based directly on function returns from the search operations, with no assumptions or made-up data.

Key findings from the search:
- "MachinaPress" appears in the CRM documentation (systems/crm.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.75, suggesting this is likely a customer name format used internally.
- "Machina Press Systems" appears in marketing context (business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.71.
- "rationalisation" appears in company history (company/history.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.73, but not specifically linked to coatings.
- No exact matches were found for "coating rationalisation" or "coating rationalization" in any wiki file.
- Project naming conventions are documented in systems/project_registry.md, with examples of coating-related projects.

Based on these findings, "Machina Press Systems" appears to be a customer name rather than a project name component, and "coating rationalisation" is not a documented project type in the wiki, though it could be a specific project description.

    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records to answer questions about project customers.
Approach: Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms (for example, SQL tables, APIs, or services). Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data. Verify accessible interfaces (for example direct SQL query layer or an internal service) that can be used to read from these tables. If no such technical mechanism is available, this will be used later to justify aborting the task as not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_storage":{"type":"string"},"customer_storage":{"type":"string"},"access_method":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_storage","customer_storage","implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 by thoroughly executing the required fuzzy and semantic/logical search across all available system architecture documentation. I examined wiki files, performed targeted searches for storage mechanisms, and verified all facts directly from function returns. The search confirmed that project records are stored in the Project Registry system and customer records in the CRM system, both built on the legacy Progress OpenEdge database technology. Access is provided through a chatbot API wrapper that exposes functions for reading and writing to these systems. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "project_storage": "Project Registry system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "customer_storage": "CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "access_method": "Chatbot API wrapper providing functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.) to interact with legacy systems via APIs",
  "implementation_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using a tiered search strategy. First attempt exact match filters on the name field for phrases like 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' (normalized to lowercase and trimmed). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the criteria: (1) check if normalized substrings such as 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', and 'machina press systems' are contained in the project.name or project.description using lowercase, whitespace-stripped comparisons; (2) apply regular expressions or partial-word matches; (3) use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to compare the query phrase against project.name and project.description, including tolerance for misspellings, swapped word order, and abbreviations. Return a list of candidate projects with their identifiers, names, and match scores, clearly indicating if zero, one, or multiple candidates were found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","match_score"]}},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["candidates","candidate_count"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 by executing the exact tiered search strategy as specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search followed this precise approach:

1. **Exact match filters**: Searched for the full phrase "coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems" - returned 0 projects
2. **Normalized substring checks**: 
   - "coating rationalisation" in project.name: found 1 project (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation)
   - "coating rationalization" in project.name: found 0 projects  
   - "machina press systems" in project.name: found 0 projects (but found in customer records)
3. **Customer verification**: Found customer "Machina Press Systems" (cust_machina_press) and searched projects by customer ID
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy comparison of target phrases against all project names, generating match scores
5. **Description verification**: For top candidates, loaded full project details to check descriptions
6. **Status checking**: Verified project statuses, particularly looking for "paused" projects

All 15 candidate projects and their match scores were derived directly from function returns. The top candidate (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation) has the highest match score (0.71) and matches all key criteria: contains "coating rationalisation" in name, associated with customer "Machina Press Systems", and has status "paused".

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "candidates": [
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "project_name": "Press line coating rationalisation", "match_score": 0.71},
    {"project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "project_name": "High-build machinery primer optimisation", "match_score": 0.49},
    {"project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring", "project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts", "project_name": "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "project_name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "project_name": "High-temperature coating for presses", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards", "project_name": "Workshop coating standards and training", "match_score": 0.45},
    {"project_id": "proj_iberia_structural_steel", "project_name": "Structural steel protection system", "match_score": 0.44},
    {"project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system", "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system", "project_name": "Bogie component coating system", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "project_name": "Multi-substrate coating portfolio", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "project_name": "Quick-clean primer for machinery line", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "project_name": "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform", "match_score": 0.42},
    {"project_id": "proj_alpinerail_depot_refurb", "project_name": "Depot steel refurbishment system", "match_score": 0.41},
    {"project_id": "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "project_name": "Port crane repainting specification", "match_score": 0.41}
  ],
  "candidate_count": 15
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user Laurent Pons to read project and associated customer information for the identified candidate projects.
Approach: Using who_am_i() or equivalent identity introspection, confirm the current user details (employee id 6KR2_024, department Sales and Customer Success, location Paris Office – France) and derive system roles or access flags. Based on company rules, evaluate whether this user is allowed to READ (not modify) records from the project and customer data sources identified in Step 2. This check should be done generically for read-only access to the candidate projects from Step 3 and their linked customers, without adding extra rules beyond those specified. Output explicit booleans indicating whether reading project metadata and reading customer metadata is permitted; if reading is not permitted, this will later lead to a security-based denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_read_projects","can_read_customers"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been completed by verifying the current user context and analyzing company rules for read access permissions. The user Laurent Pons (ID: 6KR2_024) is authenticated and belongs to the Sales & Customer Success department. Based on the provided company rules, there are no explicit restrictions on reading project or customer metadata for authenticated employees. Specifically, the rule regarding CRM mutations states that "Other roles may read CRM where allowed," indicating read access to customer data is permitted. For projects, no read restrictions are mentioned. Therefore, the user has permission to read both project and customer information.

All facts were derived from the who_am_i() function and the provided company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "6KR2_024",
  "can_read_projects": true,
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "reason": "Authenticated employees have read access to project and customer metadata; no explicit read restrictions found in company rules for these resources, and CRM rules explicitly allow other roles to read CRM."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve the customer associated with the uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' and prepare the final answer.
Approach: If Step 2 confirmed an implementation and Step 4 indicates that Laurent Pons has read permissions, and if Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate, use that project_id to query the project table for its customer_id. Then query the customer table for that customer_id to obtain the customer name (and optionally other non-sensitive metadata). If there are zero candidates or multiple equally plausible candidates from Step 3, or if implementation was not found in Step 2, or permissions are denied in Step 4, set appropriate flags to indicate that the customer cannot be determined or access is denied, without fabricating information.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"resolved":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"access_denied":{"type":"boolean"},"not_implemented":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["resolved","multiple_candidates","access_denied","not_implemented"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 5 by executing the exact approach specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. Here's what was verified:

1. **Step 2 implementation confirmed**: Yes (from Step 2 result)
2. **Step 4 permissions confirmed**: Yes, user can read projects and customers (from Step 4 result)
3. **Step 3 candidate verification**: There was one clearly best-matching candidate with match_score 0.71 (next best was 0.49), so we used project_id "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
4. **Project retrieval**: Successfully retrieved project with customer_id "cust_machina_press"
5. **Customer retrieval**: Successfully retrieved customer with name "Machina Press Systems"
6. **Project status verification**: Confirmed the project is "paused" as specified in the task

No state-changing operations were performed. All data comes directly from function returns.

{
  "resolved": true,
  "project_id": "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation",
  "project_name": "Press line coating rationalisation",
  "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
  "customer_name": "Machina Press Systems",

## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify domain-specific terms and project naming conventions related to 'coating rationalisation' and 'Machina Press Systems' using internal wiki or documentation.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in the wiki_file table (and any internal documentation index if available) for terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases. Account explicitly for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names using fuzzy matching, partial string matching, and semantic similarity. Use these findings to better understand whether 'Machina Press Systems' is typically a customer name, a project name component, or an internal codename, and capture any canonical spellings or abbreviations.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"wiki_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}}},"required":["wiki_entries"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by performing an extensive fuzzy and semantic search across all internal wiki files. The search covered the exact terms and variations including 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', 'Machina Press Systems', 'MachinaPress', and related phrases, accounting for potential spelling mistakes, spacing differences, hyphenation, and partial names. All findings are based directly on function returns from the search operations, with no assumptions or made-up data.

Key findings from the search:
- "MachinaPress" appears in the CRM documentation (systems/crm.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.75, suggesting this is likely a customer name format used internally.
- "Machina Press Systems" appears in marketing context (business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.71.
- "rationalisation" appears in company history (company/history.md) with a fuzzy match ratio of 0.73, but not specifically linked to coatings.
- No exact matches were found for "coating rationalisation" or "coating rationalization" in any wiki file.
- Project naming conventions are documented in systems/project_registry.md, with examples of coating-related projects.

Based on these findings, "Machina Press Systems" appears to be a customer name rather than a project name component, and "coating rationalisation" is not a documented project type in the wiki, though it could be a specific project description.

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records to answer questions about project customers.
Approach: Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms (for example, SQL tables, APIs, or services). Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data. Verify accessible interfaces (for example direct SQL query layer or an internal service) that can be used to read from these tables. If no such technical mechanism is available, this will be used later to justify aborting the task as not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_storage":{"type":"string"},"customer_storage":{"type":"string"},"access_method":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_storage","customer_storage","implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 by thoroughly executing the required fuzzy and semantic/logical search across all available system architecture documentation. I examined wiki files, performed targeted searches for storage mechanisms, and verified all facts directly from function returns. The search confirmed that project records are stored in the Project Registry system and customer records in the CRM system, both built on the legacy Progress OpenEdge database technology. Access is provided through a chatbot API wrapper that exposes functions for reading and writing to these systems. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

  "project_storage": "Project Registry system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "customer_storage": "CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "access_method": "Chatbot API wrapper providing functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.) to interact with legacy systems via APIs",
  "implementation_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using a tiered search strategy. First attempt exact match filters on the name field for phrases like 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' (normalized to lowercase and trimmed). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the criteria: (1) check if normalized substrings such as 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', and 'machina press systems' are contained in the project.name or project.description using lowercase, whitespace-stripped comparisons; (2) apply regular expressions or partial-word matches; (3) use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to compare the query phrase against project.name and project.description, including tolerance for misspellings, swapped word order, and abbreviations. Return a list of candidate projects with their identifiers, names, and match scores, clearly indicating if zero, one, or multiple candidates were found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","match_score"]}},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["candidates","candidate_count"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 by executing the exact tiered search strategy as specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search followed this precise approach:

1. **Exact match filters**: Searched for the full phrase "coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems" - returned 0 projects
2. **Normalized substring checks**: 
   - "coating rationalisation" in project.name: found 1 project (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation)
   - "coating rationalization" in project.name: found 0 projects  
   - "machina press systems" in project.name: found 0 projects (but found in customer records)
3. **Customer verification**: Found customer "Machina Press Systems" (cust_machina_press) and searched projects by customer ID
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy comparison of target phrases against all project names, generating match scores
5. **Description verification**: For top candidates, loaded full project details to check descriptions
6. **Status checking**: Verified project statuses, particularly looking for "paused" projects

All 15 candidate projects and their match scores were derived directly from function returns. The top candidate (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation) has the highest match score (0.71) and matches all key criteria: contains "coating rationalisation" in name, associated with customer "Machina Press Systems", and has status "paused".

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "candidates": [
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation", "project_name": "Press line coating rationalisation", "match_score": 0.71},
    {"project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer", "project_name": "High-build machinery primer optimisation", "match_score": 0.49},
    {"project_id": "proj_nordport_ramp_flooring", "project_name": "Loading ramp and dock floor system", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts", "project_name": "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer", "project_name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_high_temp", "project_name": "High-temperature coating for presses", "match_score": 0.46},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards", "project_name": "Workshop coating standards and training", "match_score": 0.45},
    {"project_id": "proj_iberia_structural_steel", "project_name": "Structural steel protection system", "match_score": 0.44},
    {"project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system", "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system", "project_name": "Bogie component coating system", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_visegrad_multi_substrate_system", "project_name": "Multi-substrate coating portfolio", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_machina_press_quick_clean", "project_name": "Quick-clean primer for machinery line", "match_score": 0.43},
    {"project_id": "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini", "project_name": "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform", "match_score": 0.42},
    {"project_id": "proj_alpinerail_depot_refurb", "project_name": "Depot steel refurbishment system", "match_score": 0.41},
    {"project_id": "proj_adriatic_port_crane_repaint", "project_name": "Port crane repainting specification", "match_score": 0.41}
  ],
  "candidate_count": 15
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user Laurent Pons to read project and associated customer information for the identified candidate projects.
Approach: Using who_am_i() or equivalent identity introspection, confirm the current user details (employee id 6KR2_024, department Sales and Customer Success, location Paris Office – France) and derive system roles or access flags. Based on company rules, evaluate whether this user is allowed to READ (not modify) records from the project and customer data sources identified in Step 2. This check should be done generically for read-only access to the candidate projects from Step 3 and their linked customers, without adding extra rules beyond those specified. Output explicit booleans indicating whether reading project metadata and reading customer metadata is permitted; if reading is not permitted, this will later lead to a security-based denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_read_projects","can_read_customers"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been completed by verifying the current user context and analyzing company rules for read access permissions. The user Laurent Pons (ID: 6KR2_024) is authenticated and belongs to the Sales & Customer Success department. Based on the provided company rules, there are no explicit restrictions on reading project or customer metadata for authenticated employees. Specifically, the rule regarding CRM mutations states that "Other roles may read CRM where allowed," indicating read access to customer data is permitted. For projects, no read restrictions are mentioned. Therefore, the user has permission to read both project and customer information.

All facts were derived from the who_am_i() function and the provided company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "6KR2_024",
  "can_read_projects": true,
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "reason": "Authenticated employees have read access to project and customer metadata; no explicit read restrictions found in company rules for these resources, and CRM rules explicitly allow other roles to read CRM."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve the customer associated with the uniquely identified 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' and prepare the final answer.
Approach: If Step 2 confirmed an implementation and Step 4 indicates that Laurent Pons has read permissions, and if Step 3 yielded exactly one clearly best-matching project candidate, use that project_id to query the project table for its customer_id. Then query the customer table for that customer_id to obtain the customer name (and optionally other non-sensitive metadata). If there are zero candidates or multiple equally plausible candidates from Step 3, or if implementation was not found in Step 2, or permissions are denied in Step 4, set appropriate flags to indicate that the customer cannot be determined or access is denied, without fabricating information.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"resolved":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"multiple_candidates":{"type":"boolean"},"access_denied":{"type":"boolean"},"not_implemented":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["resolved","multiple_candidates","access_denied","not_implemented"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 5 by executing the exact approach specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. Here's what was verified:

1. **Step 2 implementation confirmed**: Yes (from Step 2 result)
2. **Step 4 permissions confirmed**: Yes, user can read projects and customers (from Step 4 result)
3. **Step 3 candidate verification**: There was one clearly best-matching candidate with match_score 0.71 (next best was 0.49), so we used project_id "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
4. **Project retrieval**: Successfully retrieved project with customer_id "cust_machina_press"
5. **Customer retrieval**: Successfully retrieved customer with name "Machina Press Systems"
6. **Project status verification**: Confirmed the project is "paused" as specified in the task

No state-changing operations were performed. All data comes directly from function returns.

{
  "resolved": true,
  "project_id": "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation",
  "project_name": "Press line coating rationalisation",
  "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
  "customer_name": "Machina Press Systems",
  "multiple_candidates": false,
  "access_denied": false,
  "not_implemented": false
}

### Final Result
The customer for the paused coating rationalisation project ('Press line coating rationalisation') is Machina Press Systems.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
