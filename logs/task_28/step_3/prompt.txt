Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using a tiered search strategy. First attempt exact match filters on the name field for phrases like 'coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems' (normalized to lowercase and trimmed). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the criteria: (1) check if normalized substrings such as 'coating rationalisation', 'coating rationalization', and 'machina press systems' are contained in the project.name or project.description using lowercase, whitespace-stripped comparisons; (2) apply regular expressions or partial-word matches; (3) use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to compare the query phrase against project.name and project.description, including tolerance for misspellings, swapped word order, and abbreviations. Return a list of candidate projects with their identifiers, names, and match scores, clearly indicating if zero, one, or multiple candidates were found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","match_score"]}},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["candidates","candidate_count"]}
