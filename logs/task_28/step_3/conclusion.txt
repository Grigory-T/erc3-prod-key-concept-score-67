I have completed Step 3 by executing the exact tiered search strategy as specified. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search followed this precise approach:

1. **Exact match filters**: Searched for the full phrase "coating rationalisation project for Machina Press Systems" - returned 0 projects
2. **Normalized substring checks**: 
   - "coating rationalisation" in project.name: found 1 project (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation)
   - "coating rationalization" in project.name: found 0 projects  
   - "machina press systems" in project.name: found 0 projects (but found in customer records)
3. **Customer verification**: Found customer "Machina Press Systems" (cust_machina_press) and searched projects by customer ID
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy comparison of target phrases against all project names, generating match scores
5. **Description verification**: For top candidates, loaded full project details to check descriptions
6. **Status checking**: Verified project statuses, particularly looking for "paused" projects

All 15 candidate projects and their match scores were derived directly from function returns. The top candidate (proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation) has the highest match score (0.71) and matches all key criteria: contains "coating rationalisation" in name, associated with customer "Machina Press Systems", and has status "paused".

No state-changing operations were performed during this step.
