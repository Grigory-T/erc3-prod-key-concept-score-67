Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user Laurent Pons to read project and associated customer information for the identified candidate projects.
Approach: Using who_am_i() or equivalent identity introspection, confirm the current user details (employee id 6KR2_024, department Sales and Customer Success, location Paris Office – France) and derive system roles or access flags. Based on company rules, evaluate whether this user is allowed to READ (not modify) records from the project and customer data sources identified in Step 2. This check should be done generically for read-only access to the candidate projects from Step 3 and their linked customers, without adding extra rules beyond those specified. Output explicit booleans indicating whether reading project metadata and reading customer metadata is permitted; if reading is not permitted, this will later lead to a security-based denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","can_read_projects","can_read_customers"]}
