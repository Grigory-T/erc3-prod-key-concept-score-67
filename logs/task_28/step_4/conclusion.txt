Step 4 has been completed by verifying the current user context and analyzing company rules for read access permissions. The user Laurent Pons (ID: 6KR2_024) is authenticated and belongs to the Sales & Customer Success department. Based on the provided company rules, there are no explicit restrictions on reading project or customer metadata for authenticated employees. Specifically, the rule regarding CRM mutations states that "Other roles may read CRM where allowed," indicating read access to customer data is permitted. For projects, no read restrictions are mentioned. Therefore, the user has permission to read both project and customer information.

All facts were derived from the who_am_i() function and the provided company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.
