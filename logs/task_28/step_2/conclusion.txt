I have completed Step 2 by thoroughly executing the required fuzzy and semantic/logical search across all available system architecture documentation. I examined wiki files, performed targeted searches for storage mechanisms, and verified all facts directly from function returns. The search confirmed that project records are stored in the Project Registry system and customer records in the CRM system, both built on the legacy Progress OpenEdge database technology. Access is provided through a chatbot API wrapper that exposes functions for reading and writing to these systems. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "project_storage": "Project Registry system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "customer_storage": "CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)",
  "access_method": "Chatbot API wrapper providing functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.) to interact with legacy systems via APIs",
  "implementation_found": true
}
