We need to execute Step 2: Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records to answer questions about project customers.
 Approach: Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms (for example, SQL tables, APIs, or services). Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data. Verify accessible interfaces (for example direct SQL query layer or an internal service) that can be used to read from these tables.

 We have access to a wiki system. We should search the wiki for terms related to storage, databases, tables, services, etc. for project and customer.

 We'll use search_wiki_fuzzy to look for words like:
   - "project storage"
   - "customer table"
   - "database"
   - "SQL"
   - "project registry"
   - "CRM"
   - "authoritative source"

 Also, note that in the previous step we saw a wiki file "systems/project_registry.md" and "systems/crm.md". These likely contain information about storage.

 We should also check for any other documentation about the system architecture.

 Since we are expected to output:
   - project_storage: string describing where project data is stored (e.g., "SQL table 'project' in the project_registry database")
   - customer_storage: string describing where customer data is stored (e.g., "SQL table 'customer' in the CRM database")
   - access_method: string describing how to access (e.g., "via internal API functions: get_project, search_projects, etc.")
   - implementation_found: boolean indicating if we found such information.

 We can also use the functions we have (like get_project, get_customer) as evidence of the access method.

 Let's search the wiki for relevant terms.

 We'll break down the search into multiple steps to cover different terms.

We need to find technical implementation details about project and customer storage. We have already seen that the CRM and project systems are mentioned as "single source of truth" in business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md. Let's examine that file and also look for systems architecture documentation.

We should also check the systems/ directory for any technical documentation. Let's load and examine relevant files.

We'll search for "project" and "customer" in the context of storage, tables, databases, etc.

Let's first examine the systems/ directory files that might contain such information.

We have:
- systems/crm.md (already loaded)
- systems/project_registry.md (already loaded)
- systems/employee_registry.md (mentioned above)

Let's load the employee_registry.md and also check for any other systems-related files.

We'll also search for "SQL" or "database" in the wiki.

We'll do a more targeted search by loading the systems/ files and looking for technical details.

Let's write code to examine the systems/ files.

We need to examine the systems/overview.md file as it seems to contain high-level system architecture information.
 Let's load it and see what it says about project and customer storage.

We are now in Step 2. The goal is to identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records.

From the wiki search and examination, we have found:

1. **Systems Overview** (systems/overview.md) states:
   - The **CRM** stores customers and basic opportunities.
   - The **project registry** tracks all major customer and internal projects.
   - The **employee registry** stores employee profiles.

2. **Chatbot Interface** (systems/chatbot_interface.md) states that the chatbot is a modern interface on top of legacy systems (CRM, project registry, employee registry, time tracking).

3. **Legacy Technology**: The systems are built on **legacy technology** (Progress OpenEdge) and are the **single source of truth** for customer and project data.

4. **Available Functions**: We have a set of functions (APIs) that provide access to project and customer data. These are the interfaces we use to read from these systems.

5. **No Explicit SQL/Table Definitions**: We did not find explicit references to SQL tables or database schemas in the wiki. However, we do have references to "Progress OpenEdge" which is a database system.

Based on the findings, we can conclude:

- **Project Storage**: The project registry system (likely a Progress OpenEdge database) is the authoritative source for project data.
- **Customer Storage**: The CRM system (likely a Progress OpenEdge database) is the authoritative source for customer data.
- **Access Method**: The primary access method for the chatbot (and thus for us) is through the provided API functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.). These functions are the wrapper around the legacy systems.

However, note that the task asks for "technical implementation (databases, tables, or services)". We have identified the services (CRM and project registry) and the database technology (Progress OpenEdge). We do not have table names, but we have the service names and the access method (API functions).

Let's structure the output:

- project_storage: "Project Registry (Progress OpenEdge database)"
- customer_storage: "CRM (Progress OpenEdge database)"
- access_method: "Chatbot API wrapper (via provided functions: list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.)"
- implementation_found: True

We should also note that the systems are legacy and the chatbot provides a modern interface.

Let's craft the final answer.

[REASONING #11] 2025-12-09 20:35:43
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have completed Step 2 by thoroughly examining the internal wiki and available documentation.
 Based on the findings, we can now provide the expected output.

 Key findings:
 1. Project storage: The Project Registry system, built on Progress OpenEdge database.
 2. Customer storage: The CRM system, built on Progress OpenEdge database.
 3. Access method: The chatbot API wrapper provides a set of functions (like list_projects, get_customer, etc.) to interact with these legacy systems.
 4. Implementation found: Yes, the technical implementation is documented.

 Let's structure the output accordingly.

I need to verify that I executed the step instruction correctly and that all facts are derived from function returns.

Step 2 required: "Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records..."

Approach: "Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms..."

I performed:
1. Examined wiki files from Step 1 (systems/project_registry.md, systems/crm.md).
2. Performed fuzzy search for storage-related terms (database, table, SQL, etc.) using `search_wiki_fuzzy`.
3. Searched for specific regex patterns: "project.*storage", "customer.*storage", "authoritative source", etc.
4. Listed all wiki files and examined systems directory files.
5. Loaded and analyzed key systems documentation: systems/overview.md, systems/chatbot_interface.md, systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md.
6. Searched for SQL/database references: "SQL|Progress.*OpenEdge|table.*schema|database.*schema".
7. Verified API functions available for accessing project and customer data.

All facts were derived from function returns:
- `load_wiki()` returned content of various files.
- `search_wiki_fuzzy()` returned matches for storage terms.
- `search_wiki()` returned regex matches.
- `list_wiki()` returned all wiki file paths.

Key findings from function returns:
1. From `company/history.md` line 20: "The company implements its first integrated business systems, built on **Progress OpenEdge**. These systems (CRM, project registry, time tracking, employee registry) form t..."
2. From `systems/overview.md`: "The **CRM** stores customers and basic opportunities." and "The **project registry** tracks all major customer and internal projects."
3. From `systems/chatbot_interface.md`: "The **chatbot** is a modern, conversational interface that sits on top of Bellini’s legacy systems (CRM, project registry, employee registry, time tra..."
4. From `business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md`: "Even though our CRM and project systems are built on **legacy technology**, they are the **single source of truth** for: - C..."
5. From `hr/example_employee_profiles.md`: "Progress OpenEdge administration – 8" and "Database querying & reporting – 8".

I confirmed that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources? Actually, the documentation refers to "CRM" and "project registry" as the systems, not specifically SQL tables named 'project' and 'customer'. However, the step asked to confirm that SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are authoritative sources. I did not find explicit references to table names. The documentation mentions "Progress OpenEdge" which is a database, but table names are not specified.

I should note that I did not find explicit SQL table names. The step says: "Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data." I cannot confirm specific table names because they are not documented. However, I confirmed that the CRM and project registry systems are the authoritative sources.

The expected output does not require confirming specific table names, only identifying technical implementation.

I used fuzzy and semantic search as instructed. I did not skip any actions. All facts were verified from function returns.

The JSON response I provided contains:
- project_storage: "Project Registry system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)" - derived from systems/overview.md and company/history.md.
- customer_storage: "CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system built on Progress OpenEdge database (legacy system)" - derived from systems/overview.md and company/history.md.
- access_method: "Chatbot API wrapper providing functions (list_projects, get_project, search_projects, list_customers, get_customer, search_customers, etc.) to interact with legacy systems via APIs" - derived from systems/chatbot_interface.md and the list of available functions.
- implementation_found: true - because technical implementation details are documented.

I think my execution is complete. I did not change any state (no update functions called). All good.

I'll repeat the final answer and JSON blocks.
