Step 2: Identify the technical implementation (databases, tables, or services) that store project and customer records to answer questions about project customers.
Approach: Using system architecture documentation or metadata, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for project and customer storage mechanisms (for example, SQL tables, APIs, or services). Confirm that the SQL tables 'project' and 'customer' are the authoritative sources for project and customer data. Verify accessible interfaces (for example direct SQL query layer or an internal service) that can be used to read from these tables. If no such technical mechanism is available, this will be used later to justify aborting the task as not implemented.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_storage":{"type":"string"},"customer_storage":{"type":"string"},"access_method":{"type":"string"},"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_storage","customer_storage","implementation_found"]}
