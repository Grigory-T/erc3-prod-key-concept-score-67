DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:50:00
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 is fully completed according to the original plan and definitions. The operational criteria and schema mapping are solid, all details match with the actual data structures, and company policy compliance is satisfied (especially in regard to allowable employee fields and workload calculations). There are no gaps, unexpected results, or need for replanning. Step 2 is next: verify the current user's permissions to access the required non-confidential information. There are no blockers at this stage and all subsequent steps are theoretically performable if data and permissions are present.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:53:53
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The first two steps have been executed correctly and in full compliance with both company policies and the original plan wording. All key permissions and access rights have been validated and align with company rules. No unexpected results, errors, or missing capabilities have appeared. The approach and plan remain fully applicable to the data structures and authorization framework in use. Therefore, there is no need to replan, abort, or issue a final answer yet; the task should proceed to the next step in sequence.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 01:10:48
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Each step so far has delivered the expected result exactly according to the original plan: Step 1 defined the criteria and data structures; Step 2 verified the user's access and permissions for the needed data; Step 3 executed a multi-stage search and correctly identified all employees with the interest (will) for cross-site collaboration. No errors or unexpected conditions have occurred. The next plan step is to compute workload metrics for these candidates using the defined approach. There is no evidence or result so far that would require changing the plan, so continuing to Step 4 is the correct and policy-compliant decision.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 01:17:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Each step so far has produced the expected output per the original plan. The tasks of extracting candidates, measuring workload, and handling permissions were completed with no gaps or unexpected issues. The current step (Step 4) returned a full set of candidate workload metrics matching the plan. There are no inconsistencies or strange results that require replanning, and the next step as written by the plan is fully executable with the available data and system functions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 01:30:42
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the Original Plan have been strictly executed and produced expected, valid, and complete results. No inconsistencies or missing data were found. The task goal (find the least busy person(s) with interest in cross-site collaboration, using company-allowed data) has been fully achieved—the output lists all employees with minimal workload and the relevant interest, with no deviation from the plan. According to the plan instructions, the next action is to deliver the final answer.
