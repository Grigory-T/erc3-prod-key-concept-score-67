## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-03-11
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_001
User details: {"id": "CjTb_001", "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Find me the least busy person with interest in Interest in cross-site collaboration

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Define the operational criteria and data sources to identify the "least busy person with interest in cross-site collaboration" using the existing database tables.
Approach: Interpret "interest in cross-site collaboration" as an employee "will" (interest) stored in the employee_skill table. Define that we will look for rows where employee_skill.skill_type = 'will' and employee_skill.skill_name matches (via exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search) the phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration" (including variations, misspellings, abbreviations, and similar semantic concepts such as "cross-site cooperation", "cross-location collaboration", or "cross office collaboration"). Define "least busy" as the employee having the smallest total allocated workload across projects, measured by the sum of team_member.time_slice for each employee across all their projects (treat employees with no team_member records as having total_time_slice = 0, which makes them very free). Do not introduce any additional rules or validations beyond what is necessary to compute this metric from the existing schema. The expected result of this step is a clear textual definition of: (a) which skill_name we are targeting for the will, and (b) how the workload metric will be computed from team_member.time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"workload_metric":{"type":"string"},"include_employees_with_no_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["will_skill_name","workload_metric","include_employees_with_no_projects"]}
**Result:** Based on verifying the actual data structures, I confirm my definitions are accurate:

1. **Will Skill Name**: We'll search for the will (interest) named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee's `wills` list (which contains SkillLevel objects with `name` and `level` fields). We'll allow for variations through exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching.

2. **Workload Metric**: The workload for each employee will be calculated by summing the `time_slice` values from all TeamMember records where the employee appears in project teams. This is obtained from each project's `team` list.

3. **Inclusion of Unassigned Employees**: Employees without any project team assignments should be included with a workload of 0.

The verification shows that:
- Employee wills are stored as SkillLevel objects in the `wills` field
- Project teams contain TeamMember objects with `employee`, `time_slice`, and `role` fields
- The calculation can be performed using existing data structures without modification

{
  "will_skill_name": "Interest in cross-site collaboration",
  "workload_metric": "sum of time_slice values across all projects for the employee (from team_member records)",
  "include_employees_with_no_projects": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine the current user's identity, roles, and permissions needed to read employee and workload-related data (employee, employee_skill, team_member tables).
Approach: Call the internal identity and authorization service (who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity for user id "CjTb_001" (Giovanni Rinaldi) to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that this user is allowed to read non-confidential employee profile data (name, email, location, department, skills, wills) and aggregated workload information derived from team_member.time_slice, ensuring we do not access or expose restricted fields such as salary or confidential human resources notes. If the authorization check denies access to any required data source, plan to stop later with Outcome='denied_security'; otherwise proceed. This step is a pure permission and role check and should not query or log business data beyond what is necessary for authorization.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_employee_profile_basic":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_skills_wills":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_workload_from_team_member":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_read_employee_profile_basic","can_read_skills_wills","can_read_workload_from_team_member"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as requested. Here's what was explicitly verified through function calls:

1. **User Identity Verification**: Called `who_am_i()` which returned:
   - User ID: CjTb_001
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Is Public: False (authenticated user)
   - Today: 2025-03-11

2. **Additional Verification**: Called `get_employee("CjTb_001")` to verify user details:
   - Name: Giovanni Rinaldi
   - Email: CjTb_001@bellini.internal
   - Department: Corporate Leadership (confirmed)
   - Skills and Wills were retrieved (showing the user has skills/wills data)

3. **Permission Analysis Based on Company Rules**:
   - **can_read_employee_profile_basic**: TRUE - Company rules state that for chatbot access, all authenticated employees can read basic employee profile fields (name, email, location, department, skills, wills)
   - **can_read_skills_wills**: TRUE - Same as above, skills and wills are part of the context-relevant subset allowed for all employees
   - **can_read_workload_from_team_member**: TRUE - No company rule restricts reading project team data. The user is in Corporate Leadership department, which according to company rules has executive-level access to project information.

4. **System Roles Limitation**: The available API functions do not return `system_roles` as a field in either `who_am_i()` or `get_employee()`. According to the function signatures and actual returns, `system_roles` is not available through these endpoints. Therefore, I cannot retrieve actual system roles, only infer from department and company rules.

**Important Note**: No state-changing operations were performed. Only read operations were used to verify identity and permissions.

{
  "user_id": "CjTb_001",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_employee_profile_basic": true,
  "can_read_skills_wills": true,
  "can_read_workload_from_team_member": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Find all employees who have a will (interest) corresponding to "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee_skill table.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table restricted to rows where skill_type = 'will'. Use a multi-stage search against employee_skill.skill_name: (1) exact string match on the fully expanded phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration"; (2) if not sufficient, partial substring search using lowercase, whitespace-normalized comparison (e.g., "cross-site collaboration" in normalized(skill_name)); (3) apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for typos, misspellings, and word order changes; (4) apply semantic / logical matching to capture conceptually similar phrases such as "cross site collaboration", "cross-location collaboration", "inter-office collaboration", or abbreviated or slightly varied wording. For each match, compute a similarity score and keep only entries above a reasonable fuzzy / semantic confidence threshold (for example, 0.7), but do not invent any extra business rules beyond this fuzzy / semantic filtering. From the matched employee_skill rows, extract the distinct employee_id values and the matched skill_name (and optionally the similarity score) to build a candidate list of employees with an interest in cross-site collaboration. If no employees are found, the later steps will have no candidates and the final result should reflect that.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"matched_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","matched_skill_name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 3: Find all employees who have a will (interest) corresponding to "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee_skill table.

Through multi-stage search analysis, I discovered that the database stores this interest as a coded will name "will_cross_site" rather than the full descriptive phrase. I applied the following search methods:

1. **Exact string match**: No exact matches for "Interest in cross-site collaboration"
2. **Partial substring search**: No partial matches (the will name "will_cross_site" doesn't contain the full substring)
3. **Fuzzy matching**: 
   - Full phrase vs. "will_cross_site": 0.392
   - "cross site collaboration" vs. "will_cross_site": 0.462
   - "cross-site" vs. "will_cross_site": 0.720 (above 0.7 threshold)
4. **Semantic/logical matching**: The will name "will_cross_site" is conceptually equivalent to "Interest in cross-site collaboration" - it's the database representation of this interest.

Using the maximum fuzzy score of 0.720 (from "cross-site" vs. "will_cross_site"), which is above the 0.7 confidence threshold, I identified 154 employees with this interest. All 154 employees in the company have the "will_cross_site" will, indicating universal interest in cross-site collaboration.

The step is now complete with 154 candidates identified, each with a match score of 0.720.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Compute a workload metric for each candidate employee based on their total allocated time_slice across all projects in the team_member table.
Approach: Take the list of candidate employee_ids from the previous step. Query the team_member table for all rows where employee_id is in this candidate set. For each employee, sum the time_slice values across all their team_member rows (for all projects, regardless of project status, as the task does not request any status filter). If an employee_id from the candidates list has no corresponding rows in team_member, assign total_time_slice = 0.0 for that employee. Ensure that the computation handles potential data quality issues such as nulls or edge cases by treating missing time_slice as 0.0, but do not introduce any additional validation rules. The result is a list of candidate employees with their total_time_slice workload metric, where a smaller total_time_slice means the employee is less busy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["workloads"]}

<final_answer>
I have successfully completed Step 4 by computing the workload metric for each candidate employee. The workload was calculated as the sum of time_slice values across all projects for each employee. Here are the key findings:

1. **Total Candidates Processed**: 154 employees (all employees in the company have the "will_cross_site" interest)
2. **Projects Analyzed**: 36 total projects in the system
3. **Workload Distribution**: 
   - 78 employees have zero workload (no project assignments)
   - 76 employees have non-zero workload
   - Minimum workload: 0.00
   - Maximum workload: 1.80
   - Average workload: 0.24

The computation followed the approach defined in Step 1: for each employee, I summed their time_slice values from all TeamMember records across all projects. Employees without any project assignments were assigned a total_time_slice of 0.0 as specified.

All 154 candidate employees from Step 3 have been processed, and their workload metrics are now available for the next step in the task.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Compute a workload metric for each candidate employee based on their total allocated time_slice across all projects in the team_member table.
Approach: Take the list of candidate employee_ids from the previous step. Query the team_member table for all rows where employee_id is in this candidate set. For each employee, sum the time_slice values across all their team_member rows (for all projects, regardless of project status, as the task does not request any status filter). If an employee_id from the candidates list has no corresponding rows in team_member, assign total_time_slice = 0.0 for that employee. Ensure that the computation handles potential data quality issues such as nulls or edge cases by treating missing time_slice as 0.0, but do not introduce any additional validation rules. The result is a list of candidate employees with their total_time_slice workload metric, where a smaller total_time_slice means the employee is less busy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["workloads"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I verified all facts through actual function calls:

1. **Candidate List**: Used the exact 154 employee IDs from Step 3 results
2. **Project Data**: Retrieved all 36 projects in the system using pagination (`list_projects` with offset/limit)
3. **Team Member Analysis**: For each project, called `get_project` to obtain full project details including team members
4. **Workload Calculation**: Summed `time_slice` values for each employee across all projects
5. **Zero Assignment**: Employees without project assignments were correctly assigned 0.0 workload

All data was explicitly retrieved from system functions. No data was invented or assumed. The workloads were calculated from actual project team data. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations were used.

The verification shows:
- Total projects: 36 (confirmed by pagination results)
- Total employees with workload > 0: 76 (confirmed by calculation)
- Total employees with workload = 0: 78 (confirmed by calculation)
- Workload range: 0.0 to 1.8 (confirmed by min/max calculation)

All employee IDs and their corresponding total_time_slice values in the JSON output are derived directly from system function returns.
