Step 4: Compute a workload metric for each candidate employee based on their total allocated time_slice across all projects in the team_member table.
Approach: Take the list of candidate employee_ids from the previous step. Query the team_member table for all rows where employee_id is in this candidate set. For each employee, sum the time_slice values across all their team_member rows (for all projects, regardless of project status, as the task does not request any status filter). If an employee_id from the candidates list has no corresponding rows in team_member, assign total_time_slice = 0.0 for that employee. Ensure that the computation handles potential data quality issues such as nulls or edge cases by treating missing time_slice as 0.0, but do not introduce any additional validation rules. The result is a list of candidate employees with their total_time_slice workload metric, where a smaller total_time_slice means the employee is less busy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["workloads"]}
