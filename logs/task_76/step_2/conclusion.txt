STEP 2 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:53:50

I have executed Step 2 as requested. Here's what was explicitly verified through function calls:

1. **User Identity Verification**: Called `who_am_i()` which returned:
   - User ID: CjTb_001
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Is Public: False (authenticated user)
   - Today: 2025-03-11

2. **Additional Verification**: Called `get_employee("CjTb_001")` to verify user details:
   - Name: Giovanni Rinaldi
   - Email: CjTb_001@bellini.internal
   - Department: Corporate Leadership (confirmed)
   - Skills and Wills were retrieved (showing the user has skills/wills data)

3. **Permission Analysis Based on Company Rules**:
   - **can_read_employee_profile_basic**: TRUE - Company rules state that for chatbot access, all authenticated employees can read basic employee profile fields (name, email, location, department, skills, wills)
   - **can_read_skills_wills**: TRUE - Same as above, skills and wills are part of the context-relevant subset allowed for all employees
   - **can_read_workload_from_team_member**: TRUE - No company rule restricts reading project team data. The user is in Corporate Leadership department, which according to company rules has executive-level access to project information.

4. **System Roles Limitation**: The available API functions do not return `system_roles` as a field in either `who_am_i()` or `get_employee()`. According to the function signatures and actual returns, `system_roles` is not available through these endpoints. Therefore, I cannot retrieve actual system roles, only infer from department and company rules.

**Important Note**: No state-changing operations were performed. Only read operations were used to verify identity and permissions.

{
  "user_id": "CjTb_001",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_employee_profile_basic": true,
  "can_read_skills_wills": true,
  "can_read_workload_from_team_member": true
}
