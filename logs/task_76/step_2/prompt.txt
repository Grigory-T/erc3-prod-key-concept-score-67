Step 2: Determine the current user's identity, roles, and permissions needed to read employee and workload-related data (employee, employee_skill, team_member tables).
Approach: Call the internal identity and authorization service (who_am_i or equivalent) using the bound identity for user id "CjTb_001" (Giovanni Rinaldi) to retrieve their department, location, and system_roles. Based on company rules, verify that this user is allowed to read non-confidential employee profile data (name, email, location, department, skills, wills) and aggregated workload information derived from team_member.time_slice, ensuring we do not access or expose restricted fields such as salary or confidential human resources notes. If the authorization check denies access to any required data source, plan to stop later with Outcome='denied_security'; otherwise proceed. This step is a pure permission and role check and should not query or log business data beyond what is necessary for authorization.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_employee_profile_basic":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_skills_wills":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_workload_from_team_member":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","can_read_employee_profile_basic","can_read_skills_wills","can_read_workload_from_team_member"]}
