Based on verifying the actual data structures, I confirm my definitions are accurate:

1. **Will Skill Name**: We'll search for the will (interest) named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee's `wills` list (which contains SkillLevel objects with `name` and `level` fields). We'll allow for variations through exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching.

2. **Workload Metric**: The workload for each employee will be calculated by summing the `time_slice` values from all TeamMember records where the employee appears in project teams. This is obtained from each project's `team` list.

3. **Inclusion of Unassigned Employees**: Employees without any project team assignments should be included with a workload of 0.

The verification shows that:
- Employee wills are stored as SkillLevel objects in the `wills` field
- Project teams contain TeamMember objects with `employee`, `time_slice`, and `role` fields
- The calculation can be performed using existing data structures without modification

{
  "will_skill_name": "Interest in cross-site collaboration",
  "workload_metric": "sum of time_slice values across all projects for the employee (from team_member records)",
  "include_employees_with_no_projects": true
}
