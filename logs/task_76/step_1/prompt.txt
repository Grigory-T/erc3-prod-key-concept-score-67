Step 1: Define the operational criteria and data sources to identify the "least busy person with interest in cross-site collaboration" using the existing database tables.
Approach: Interpret "interest in cross-site collaboration" as an employee "will" (interest) stored in the employee_skill table. Define that we will look for rows where employee_skill.skill_type = 'will' and employee_skill.skill_name matches (via exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search) the phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration" (including variations, misspellings, abbreviations, and similar semantic concepts such as "cross-site cooperation", "cross-location collaboration", or "cross office collaboration"). Define "least busy" as the employee having the smallest total allocated workload across projects, measured by the sum of team_member.time_slice for each employee across all their projects (treat employees with no team_member records as having total_time_slice = 0, which makes them very free). Do not introduce any additional rules or validations beyond what is necessary to compute this metric from the existing schema. The expected result of this step is a clear textual definition of: (a) which skill_name we are targeting for the will, and (b) how the workload metric will be computed from team_member.time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"workload_metric":{"type":"string"},"include_employees_with_no_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["will_skill_name","workload_metric","include_employees_with_no_projects"]}
