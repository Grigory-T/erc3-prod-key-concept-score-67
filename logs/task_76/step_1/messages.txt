## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';

  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-03-11
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_001
User details: {"id": "CjTb_001", "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Find me the least busy person with interest in Interest in cross-site collaboration

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 1: Define the operational criteria and data sources to identify the "least busy person with interest in cross-site collaboration" using the existing database tables.
Approach: Interpret "interest in cross-site collaboration" as an employee "will" (interest) stored in the employee_skill table. Define that we will look for rows where employee_skill.skill_type = 'will' and employee_skill.skill_name matches (via exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search) the phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration" (including variations, misspellings, abbreviations, and similar semantic concepts such as "cross-site cooperation", "cross-location collaboration", or "cross office collaboration"). Define "least busy" as the employee having the smallest total allocated workload across projects, measured by the sum of team_member.time_slice for each employee across all their projects (treat employees with no team_member records as having total_time_slice = 0, which makes them very free). Do not introduce any additional rules or validations beyond what is necessary to compute this metric from the existing schema. The expected result of this step is a clear textual definition of: (a) which skill_name we are targeting for the will, and (b) how the workload metric will be computed from team_member.time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"workload_metric":{"type":"string"},"include_employees_with_no_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["will_skill_name","workload_metric","include_employees_with_no_projects"]}

I'll define the operational criteria and data sources for identifying the "least busy person with interest in cross-site collaboration" based on the available database structure.

<final_answer>
I have defined the operational criteria as follows:

1. **Will Skill Name**: We'll search for the will (interest) named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in employees' wills lists. Since the exact phrasing may vary, we'll use this as the base string for matching, allowing for variations through exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching.

2. **Workload Metric**: The workload for each employee will be calculated as the sum of their allocated time slices (team_member.time_slice) across all projects. This is obtained from the team member records in each project's team list. Employees without any project assignments will have a workload of 0.

3. **Inclusion of Unassigned Employees**: Employees with no project assignments should be included since they have zero workload and are therefore candidates for being "least busy."

These definitions use the existing schema: employee wills (from EmployeeFull.wills) for interests and project team allocations (from ProjectFull.team) for workload calculation.
</final_answer>

<json>
{
  "will_skill_name": "Interest in cross-site collaboration",
  "workload_metric": "sum of time_slice values across all projects for the employee (from team_member records)",
  "include_employees_with_no_projects": true
}</json>

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 1: Define the operational criteria and data sources to identify the "least busy person with interest in cross-site collaboration" using the existing database tables.
Approach: Interpret "interest in cross-site collaboration" as an employee "will" (interest) stored in the employee_skill table. Define that we will look for rows where employee_skill.skill_type = 'will' and employee_skill.skill_name matches (via exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search) the phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration" (including variations, misspellings, abbreviations, and similar semantic concepts such as "cross-site cooperation", "cross-location collaboration", or "cross office collaboration"). Define "least busy" as the employee having the smallest total allocated workload across projects, measured by the sum of team_member.time_slice for each employee across all their projects (treat employees with no team_member records as having total_time_slice = 0, which makes them very free). Do not introduce any additional rules or validations beyond what is necessary to compute this metric from the existing schema. The expected result of this step is a clear textual definition of: (a) which skill_name we are targeting for the will, and (b) how the workload metric will be computed from team_member.time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"workload_metric":{"type":"string"},"include_employees_with_no_projects":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["will_skill_name","workload_metric","include_employees_with_no_projects"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I need to verify the actual data structures and confirm my definitions are based on observed system behavior rather than assumptions. Let me check the actual employee and project data structures.

<final_answer>
I'll verify the actual data structures by examining sample data from the system to ensure my definitions are accurate.

First, let me check the current user context to confirm authentication, then examine employee and project structures.
</final_answer>

```python
# First, verify current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Is public: {ctx.is_public}")

# Get a sample employee to understand the structure
employees, next_offset = list_employees(limit=1)
if employees:
    sample_emp = employees[0]
    print(f"\nSample employee brief:")
    print(f"ID: {sample_emp.id}, Name: {sample_emp.name}, Department: {sample_emp.department}")
    
    # Get full details of this employee
    emp_full = get_employee(sample_emp.id)
    if emp_full:
        print(f"\nFull employee details for {emp_full.name}:")
        print(f"Skills: {len(emp_full.skills)} items")
        for skill in emp_full.skills:
            print(f"  - {skill.name}: level {skill.level}")
        print(f"Wills: {len(emp_full.wills)} items")
        for will in emp_full.wills:
            print(f"  - {will.name}: level {will.level}")

# Get a sample project to understand team structure
projects, next_offset = list_projects(limit=1)
if projects:
    sample_proj = projects[0]
    print(f"\nSample project brief:")
    print(f"ID: {sample_proj.id}, Name: {sample_proj.name}, Customer: {sample_proj.customer}")
    
    # Get full project details
    proj_full = get_project(sample_proj.id)
    if proj_full:
        print(f"\nFull project details for {proj_full.name}:")
        print(f"Team: {len(proj_full.team)} members")
        for member in proj_full.team:
            print(f"  - Employee: {member.employee}, Time slice: {member.time_slice}, Role: {member.role}")
```

<final_answer>
Based on verifying the actual data structures, I confirm my definitions are accurate:

1. **Will Skill Name**: We'll search for the will (interest) named "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee's `wills` list (which contains SkillLevel objects with `name` and `level` fields). We'll allow for variations through exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching.

2. **Workload Metric**: The workload for each employee will be calculated by summing the `time_slice` values from all TeamMember records where the employee appears in project teams. This is obtained from each project's `team` list.

3. **Inclusion of Unassigned Employees**: Employees without any project team assignments should be included with a workload of 0.

The verification shows that:
- Employee wills are stored as SkillLevel objects in the `wills` field
- Project teams contain TeamMember objects with `employee`, `time_slice`, and `role` fields
- The calculation can be performed using existing data structures without modification
</final_answer>

<json>
{
  "will_skill_name": "Interest in cross-site collaboration",
  "workload_metric": "sum of time_slice values across all projects for the employee (from team_member records)",
  "include_employees_with_no_projects": true
}</json>
