Step 3: Find all employees who have a will (interest) corresponding to "Interest in cross-site collaboration" in the employee_skill table.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table restricted to rows where skill_type = 'will'. Use a multi-stage search against employee_skill.skill_name: (1) exact string match on the fully expanded phrase "Interest in cross-site collaboration"; (2) if not sufficient, partial substring search using lowercase, whitespace-normalized comparison (e.g., "cross-site collaboration" in normalized(skill_name)); (3) apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for typos, misspellings, and word order changes; (4) apply semantic / logical matching to capture conceptually similar phrases such as "cross site collaboration", "cross-location collaboration", "inter-office collaboration", or abbreviated or slightly varied wording. For each match, compute a similarity score and keep only entries above a reasonable fuzzy / semantic confidence threshold (for example, 0.7), but do not invent any extra business rules beyond this fuzzy / semantic filtering. From the matched employee_skill rows, extract the distinct employee_id values and the matched skill_name (and optionally the similarity score) to build a candidate list of employees with an interest in cross-site collaboration. If no employees are found, the later steps will have no candidates and the final result should reflect that.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"matched_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","matched_skill_name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
