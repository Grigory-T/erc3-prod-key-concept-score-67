Step 5: Identify the least busy employee or employees among the candidates based on the computed workload metric and prepare the final result.
Approach: From the workloads list produced in the previous step, calculate the minimum total_time_slice value across all candidate employees. Select all employees whose total_time_slice equals this minimum value (to avoid arbitrary tie-breaking, return all equally least busy employees rather than creating extra rules). Optionally, sort the resulting employees in a deterministic way (for example, by employee_id or by name, using a simple ascending order) to make the output stable, but do not apply any additional business filters. For each selected employee, retrieve their basic profile information from the employee table (name, email, location, department) without including restricted fields such as salary or confidential human resources notes. The final output of this step is the list of least busy employees who have a will related to cross-site collaboration, with their identifiers, basic profile data, matched skill name, and workload metric.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"least_busy_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"matched_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","location","department","matched_skill_name","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["least_busy_employees"]}
