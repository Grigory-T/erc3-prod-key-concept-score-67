Step 1: Identify the correct employee record for "Emma Lefèvre" in the employee table and determine her internal employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person named "Emma Lefèvre". First, attempt an exact match on the name field (case insensitive, accent sensitive). If not found, or if multiple matches appear, progressively relax the search using partial matching (checking if the normalized search string is contained in the normalized name and email fields), and then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searching to account for possible misspellings, accent variations (e.g., "Lefevre" vs "Lefèvre"), spacing, and ordering of first and last names. If multiple candidates are returned, select the best match based on highest fuzzy similarity score and semantic relevance; if there is still ambiguity, mark it in the output. This step must explicitly consider that names and identifiers may contain mistakes or typos and use fuzzy matching, partial matching, and, if needed, listing all employees and scanning them.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "matches_considered": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["target_employee_name", "found", "ambiguous"]}
