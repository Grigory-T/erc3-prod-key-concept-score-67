I have successfully completed Step 1 to identify the correct employee record for "Emma Lefèvre". I executed the step instruction thoroughly by:

1. **Exact match**: Found exactly one employee with the exact name "Emma Lefèvre" (ID: Bhwa_024).
2. **Partial matching**: Checked if the normalized search string is contained in employee names and emails.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Used fuzzy_compare with multiple target variations ("Emma Lefèvre", "Emma Lefevre", etc.) against all employee names. The top match is "Emma Lefèvre" with a perfect score of 1.000.
4. **Semantic/logical searching**: Tried variations like "Emma", "Lefèvre", "Lefevre", and checked for any other employees with similar names.
5. **Ambiguity check**: No other candidates had a fuzzy ratio >= 0.8, and no other employees contain "Emma" or "Lefèvre" in their names.

All facts were verified directly from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed. The result is clear and unambiguous.
