Completed: 2025-12-10 00:41:04

I have successfully completed Step 5 to prepare the final answer summarizing Emma Lefèvre's logged hours between February 1-28, 2025. All facts were verified through function calls:

1. Verified employee name by calling `get_employee("Bhwa_024")` which returned "Emma Lefèvre"
2. Used the exact calculated values from Step 4: total_hours=9.5, billable_hours=7.5, non_billable_hours=2.0
3. Constructed a human-readable summary that explicitly states the date range, total hours, billable hours, and non-billable hours
4. Ensured no sensitive information beyond the required aggregates was exposed

All values in the JSON output are directly derived from verified function returns or previous step results. No state-changing operations were performed.
