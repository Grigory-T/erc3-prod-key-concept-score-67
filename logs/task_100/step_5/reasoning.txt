We are at Step 5. We need to prepare the final answer summarizing the hours logged by Emma Lefèvre.

 We already have from previous steps:
   - Employee name: Emma Lefèvre (from Step 1)
   - Employee ID: Bhwa_024 (from Step 1)
   - Date range: 2025-02-01 to 2025-02-28 (from Step 3 and Step 4)
   - Total hours: 9.5 (from Step 4)
   - Billable hours: 7.5 (from Step 4)
   - Non-billable hours: 2.0 (from Step 4)

 We need to construct a clear, human-readable answer text and provide the data in the required JSON format.

 Let's do a quick sanity check by retrieving the employee name again to be sure, but we already have it.

 We are also to ensure no sensitive information is exposed. We are only using the aggregates.

 Since we are in Step 5, we are just preparing the final answer. No new data retrieval is needed, but we can double-check the employee name.

 However, note that the expected output requires the employee_name. We can get it from the employee record to be safe.

 Let's do that.

We have completed Step 5. The code executed successfully and printed the required information.
 Now, we need to format the output as a JSON object with the expected properties.
 We have:
   employee_name: "Emma Lefèvre"
   employee_id: "Bhwa_024"
   date_range_start: "2025-02-01"
   date_range_end: "2025-02-28"
   answer_text: "Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable."
   total_hours: 9.5
   billable_hours: 7.5
   non_billable_hours: 2.0

 We must output this in the required JSON structure.

I need to verify that I executed Step 5 correctly according to the checklist.

Let's review:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes. The step instruction says: "Combine the computed values from Step 4 with the verified employee name and date range to construct a clear, human-readable summary. Explicitly state the date range (inclusive), the total number of hours logged, the subset that is billable, and the subset that is non-billable. Ensure the response does not expose any additional sensitive information beyond these aggregates. Include the numeric values again in a machine-readable structure alongside the narrative text."

   I did exactly that:
   - I retrieved the employee details to verify the name (Emma Lefèvre).
   - I used the computed values from Step 4 (total_hours=9.5, billable_hours=7.5, non_billable_hours=2.0).
   - I constructed a human-readable summary: "Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable."
   - I included the numeric values in the JSON output.

2. **Is there any action I skipped or assumed?** No. I used the exact values from Step 4, which were already verified. I also verified the employee name by calling `get_employee("Bhwa_024")` and printed the result. No assumptions were made.

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes:
   - Employee name: Verified via `get_employee` call, printed: "Emma Lefèvre".
   - Employee ID: From Step 1 and verified again.
   - Date range: From Step 3 and Step 4, used as given.
   - Total hours, billable hours, non-billable hours: From Step 4, which were computed from the time entries retrieved in Step 3. I also cross-verified with `time_summary_by_employee` in Step 4.

4. **JSON response contains only values explicitly printed/verified:** Yes, all values in the JSON are from the printed output:
   - employee_name: "Emma Lefèvre" (printed)
   - employee_id: "Bhwa_024" (printed)
   - date_range_start: "2025-02-01" (used in Step 3 and Step 4)
   - date_range_end: "2025-02-28" (used in Step 3 and Step 4)
   - answer_text: constructed from verified values
   - total_hours: 9.5 (printed)
   - billable_hours: 7.5 (printed)
   - non_billable_hours: 2.0 (printed)

5. **No state-changing functions were called:** I only called `get_employee`, which is a read-only function. No update functions were used.

6. **I did not use any make-up data:** All data came from function returns.

Thus, I am confident the step is complete. I'll now provide the final answer and JSON blocks again.
