Step 5: Prepare the final answer summarizing how many total hours Emma Lefèvre logged between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, and how many of those hours were billable versus non-billable.
Approach: Combine the computed values from Step 4 with the verified employee name and date range to construct a clear, human-readable summary. Explicitly state the date range (inclusive), the total number of hours logged, the subset that is billable, and the subset that is non-billable. Ensure the response does not expose any additional sensitive information beyond these aggregates. Include the numeric values again in a machine-readable structure alongside the narrative text.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "answer_text": {"type": "string"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_name", "employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "answer_text", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
