Steps:
  1. Identify the correct employee record for "Emma Lefèvre" in the employee table and determine her internal employee_id.
     Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person named "Emma Lefèvre". First, attempt an exact match on the name field (case insensitive, accent sensitive). If not found, or if multiple matches appear, progressively relax the search using partial matching (checking if the normalized search string is contained in the normalized name and email fields), and then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searching to account for possible misspellings, accent variations (e.g., "Lefevre" vs "Lefèvre"), spacing, and ordering of first and last names. If multiple candidates are returned, select the best match based on highest fuzzy similarity score and semantic relevance; if there is still ambiguity, mark it in the output. This step must explicitly consider that names and identifiers may contain mistakes or typos and use fuzzy matching, partial matching, and, if needed, listing all employees and scanning them.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "matches_considered": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["target_employee_name", "found", "ambiguous"]}
  2. Check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user (Ilaria Puglisi, employee_id=Bhwa_133) to read time entry data for the identified employee (Emma Lefèvre).
     Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and role resolution function to confirm the current user context (employee_id, department, system_roles). Using the resolved identity and the target_employee_id from Step 1, evaluate authorization rules for reading time_entry records (not salary data). Since the current user is in the Human Resources department, verify that this role is allowed to view another employee's time entries under the company policies. Explicitly ensure no salary or confidential human resources notes are requested. If access is allowed, proceed; if denied, note the denial reason and prepare for a possible security-based abort. This step is purely a permission check and does not perform any data retrieval beyond what is required to check roles.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "allowed_to_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "allowed_to_view_time_entries"]}
  3. Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), including billable flag and hours.
     Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 are granted, query the time_entry table for rows where employee_id equals the target_employee_id from Step 1 and entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not introduce any additional filters on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided entries) because the task asks literally for hours logged. Select at least: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. Use exact matching for employee_id. If no records are found, return an empty list but still include the date range in the output context.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "time_entries"]}
  4. Compute the total hours logged, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours for the specified period based on the retrieved time entries.
     Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate through each entry and sum the hours for all records to compute the total_hours. Separately, sum hours where billable is true to obtain billable_hours, and sum hours where billable is false to obtain non_billable_hours. Use precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors. Do not exclude any entries based on status. If there are no entries, all totals should be zero. Optionally cross-check the results by also performing an SQL aggregation (GROUP BY billable) to validate consistency, but keep this step's primary goal as the calculation of totals.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
  5. Prepare the final answer summarizing how many total hours Emma Lefèvre logged between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, and how many of those hours were billable versus non-billable.
     Approach: Combine the computed values from Step 4 with the verified employee name and date range to construct a clear, human-readable summary. Explicitly state the date range (inclusive), the total number of hours logged, the subset that is billable, and the subset that is non-billable. Ensure the response does not expose any additional sensitive information beyond these aggregates. Include the numeric values again in a machine-readable structure alongside the narrative text.
     Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "answer_text": {"type": "string"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_name", "employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "answer_text", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
