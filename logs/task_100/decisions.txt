DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:31:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been fully and unambiguously completed as defined in the original plan. There are no discrepancies or unexpected results. The employee 'Emma Lefèvre' was precisely identified with employee_id 'Bhwa_024'. The next step is to check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user (Ilaria Puglisi, employee_id=Bhwa_133) to read time entry data for Emma Lefèvre, per the step-by-step plan. No need to replan or abort at this stage.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:35:32
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both Step 1 and Step 2 have been completed accurately and have produced the expected results according to the original plan and company rules. The employee record was identified unambiguously and permission to read time_entry data was confirmed to be allowed. The plan remains fully valid and executable for the next step: retrieving time_entry records for the target employee in the specified date range. No new obstacles, missing functions, or discrepancies have arisen. Therefore, there is no need to replan or abort; the most appropriate action is to continue with the next step as defined in the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:37:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced the expected results according to the Original Plan, with full, correct data returned at each point. There are no inconsistencies or missing information. The remaining steps involve simply calculating aggregates based on the explicitly available time entry records and then summarizing them, exactly as planned. There is no policy or technical blocker, and information required for the next step is present and complete.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:39:53
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Each step of the original plan has been completed successfully and in full accordance with the plan's instructions, company policies, and required outputs. All intermediate data checks out, there were no inconsistencies, and the expected aggregates (totals, billable, non-billable hours) were computed precisely. There is only one step left: to prepare and summarize the results (Step 5), which can be executed immediately. The plan is valid and on track.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:41:28
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed successfully, each delivering the expected outputs with no errors or missing information. There are no remaining steps. The task's goal—to determine Emma Lefèvre's total and billable/non-billable hours logged between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28—has been fully achieved with precise, verified data. No discrepancies or violations of company policy were detected.
