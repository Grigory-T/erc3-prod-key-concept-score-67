I have successfully completed Step 4 to compute the total hours logged by Emma Lefèvre between February 1-28, 2025, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours.

Using the 3 time entries retrieved in Step 3:
1. Entry te_010 (2025-02-03): 3.0 hours, billable = true
2. Entry te_011 (2025-02-10): 2.0 hours, billable = false  
3. Entry te_012 (2025-02-21): 4.5 hours, billable = true

Calculation:
- Total hours = 3.0 + 2.0 + 4.5 = 9.5 hours
- Billable hours = 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5 hours
- Non-billable hours = 2.0 hours

I cross-verified the calculation using the `time_summary_by_employee` function, which returned identical results, confirming the accuracy of the computation.

All calculations used precise decimal arithmetic as required, and no rounding errors were introduced.
