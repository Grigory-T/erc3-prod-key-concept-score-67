Step 4: Compute the total hours logged, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours for the specified period based on the retrieved time entries.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate through each entry and sum the hours for all records to compute the total_hours. Separately, sum hours where billable is true to obtain billable_hours, and sum hours where billable is false to obtain non_billable_hours. Use precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors. Do not exclude any entries based on status. If there are no entries, all totals should be zero. Optionally cross-check the results by also performing an SQL aggregation (GROUP BY billable) to validate consistency, but keep this step's primary goal as the calculation of totals.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
