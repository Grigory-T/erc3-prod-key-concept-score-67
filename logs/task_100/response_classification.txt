## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct employee record for "Emma Lefèvre" in the employee table and determine her internal employee_id.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person named "Emma Lefèvre". First, attempt an exact match on the name field (case insensitive, accent sensitive). If not found, or if multiple matches appear, progressively relax the search using partial matching (checking if the normalized search string is contained in the normalized name and email fields), and then apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searching to account for possible misspellings, accent variations (e.g., "Lefevre" vs "Lefèvre"), spacing, and ordering of first and last names. If multiple candidates are returned, select the best match based on highest fuzzy similarity score and semantic relevance; if there is still ambiguity, mark it in the output. This step must explicitly consider that names and identifiers may contain mistakes or typos and use fuzzy matching, partial matching, and, if needed, listing all employees and scanning them.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"target_employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "matches_considered": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "email": {"type": "string"}, "match_score": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "match_score"]}}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "ambiguous": {"type": "boolean"}}, "required": ["target_employee_name", "found", "ambiguous"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 1 to identify the correct employee record for "Emma Lefèvre". I executed the step instruction thoroughly by:

1. **Exact match**: Found exactly one employee with the exact name "Emma Lefèvre" (ID: Bhwa_024).
2. **Partial matching**: Checked if the normalized search string is contained in employee names and emails.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Used fuzzy_compare with multiple target variations ("Emma Lefèvre", "Emma Lefevre", etc.) against all employee names. The top match is "Emma Lefèvre" with a perfect score of 1.000.
4. **Semantic/logical searching**: Tried variations like "Emma", "Lefèvre", "Lefevre", and checked for any other employees with similar names.
5. **Ambiguity check**: No other candidates had a fuzzy ratio >= 0.8, and no other employees contain "Emma" or "Lefèvre" in their names.

All facts were verified directly from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed. The result is clear and unambiguous.

    }
  ],
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user (Ilaria Puglisi, employee_id=Bhwa_133) to read time entry data for the identified employee (Emma Lefèvre).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and role resolution function to confirm the current user context (employee_id, department, system_roles). Using the resolved identity and the target_employee_id from Step 1, evaluate authorization rules for reading time_entry records (not salary data). Since the current user is in the Human Resources department, verify that this role is allowed to view another employee's time entries under the company policies. Explicitly ensure no salary or confidential human resources notes are requested. If access is allowed, proceed; if denied, note the denial reason and prepare for a possible security-based abort. This step is purely a permission check and does not perform any data retrieval beyond what is required to check roles.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "allowed_to_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "allowed_to_view_time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user to read time entry data for Emma Lefèvre. 

I executed the step instruction as follows:

1. **Called who_am_i()** to confirm current user context: employee_id=Bhwa_133, department=Human Resources (HR), location=HQ – Italy, is_public=False (authenticated).

2. **Retrieved target employee information** from Step 1: target_employee_id=Bhwa_024 (Emma Lefèvre).

3. **Attempted to retrieve system_roles**: The available functions (who_am_i() and get_employee()) do not expose system_roles fields. The EmployeeFull model and WhoAmI model do not contain system_roles attributes. Therefore, current_user_roles is returned as an empty array [].

4. **Evaluated authorization rules** based on company policies:
   - No explicit rules restrict HR department from reading time entry data for reporting purposes
   - The task involves reading time entries only, not salary or confidential HR notes
   - HR typically requires access to time data for reporting, compliance, and analytics
   - The user is authenticated and belongs to the HR department

5. **Verified no salary or confidential HR notes are requested**: The task explicitly only involves time entry data, not sensitive information.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Current user context from who_am_i()
- Target employee details from get_employee("Bhwa_024")
- No state-changing operations were performed
- No assumptions were made beyond what the functions explicitly returned

Therefore, the current user is allowed to view time entries for the target employee.

{
  "current_user_id": "Bhwa_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "allowed_to_view_time_entries": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), including billable flag and hours.
Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 are granted, query the time_entry table for rows where employee_id equals the target_employee_id from Step 1 and entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not introduce any additional filters on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided entries) because the task asks literally for hours logged. Select at least: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. Use exact matching for employee_id. If no records are found, return an empty list but still include the date range in the output context.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 3 to retrieve all time entry records for Emma Lefèvre (employee_id: Bhwa_024) between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28. The step was executed as follows:

1. **Verified the employee exists**: Confirmed that employee Bhwa_024 (Emma Lefèvre) exists in the system.

2. **Queried time entries**: Used the `search_time_entries` function with parameters:
   - `employee="Bhwa_024"` (target employee)
   - `date_from="2025-02-01"` and `date_to="2025-02-28"` (inclusive date range)
   - No filters on status or billable flag (to include all entries)

3. **Results**: Found exactly 3 time entries for the specified period. The function returned all entries in a single batch (no pagination needed).

4. **Entry details**: All 3 entries have been captured with their complete information including ID, date, hours, billable status, entry status, customer ID, and project ID.

The search was comprehensive and no additional filters were applied, ensuring we captured all time entries logged by Emma Lefèvre during February 2025.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_010",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-03",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_011",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-10",
      "hours": 2.0,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_012",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-21",
      "hours": 4.5,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Compute the total hours logged, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours for the specified period based on the retrieved time entries.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate through each entry and sum the hours for all records to compute the total_hours. Separately, sum hours where billable is true to obtain billable_hours, and sum hours where billable is false to obtain non_billable_hours. Use precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors. Do not exclude any entries based on status. If there are no entries, all totals should be zero. Optionally cross-check the results by also performing an SQL aggregation (GROUP BY billable) to validate consistency, but keep this step's primary goal as the calculation of totals.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 4 to compute the total hours logged by Emma Lefèvre between February 1-28, 2025, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours.

Using the 3 time entries retrieved in Step 3:
1. Entry te_010 (2025-02-03): 3.0 hours, billable = true
2. Entry te_011 (2025-02-10): 2.0 hours, billable = false  
3. Entry te_012 (2025-02-21): 4.5 hours, billable = true

Calculation:
- Total hours = 3.0 + 2.0 + 4.5 = 9.5 hours
- Billable hours = 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5 hours
- Non-billable hours = 2.0 hours

I cross-verified the calculation using the `time_summary_by_employee` function, which returned identical results, confirming the accuracy of the computation.

All calculations used precise decimal arithmetic as required, and no rounding errors were introduced.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare the final answer summarizing how many total hours Emma Lefèvre logged between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, and how many of those hours were billable versus non-billable.
Approach: Combine the computed values from Step 4 with the verified employee name and date range to construct a clear, human-readable summary. Explicitly state the date range (inclusive), the total number of hours logged, the subset that is billable, and the subset that is non-billable. Ensure the response does not expose any additional sensitive information beyond these aggregates. Include the numeric values again in a machine-readable structure alongside the narrative text.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "answer_text": {"type": "string"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_name", "employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "answer_text", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 5 to prepare the final answer summarizing Emma Lefèvre's logged hours between February 1-28, 2025. All facts were verified through function calls:

1. Verified employee name by calling `get_employee("Bhwa_024")` which returned "Emma Lefèvre"
2. Used the exact calculated values from Step 4: total_hours=9.5, billable_hours=7.5, non_billable_hours=2.0
3. Constructed a human-readable summary that explicitly states the date range, total hours, billable hours, and non-billable hours
4. Ensured no sensitive information beyond the required aggregates was exposed

All values in the JSON output are directly derived from verified function returns or previous step results. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_name": "Emma Lefèvre",
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "answer_text": "Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Final Result
Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.

      "match_score": 0.435
    }
  ],
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user (Ilaria Puglisi, employee_id=Bhwa_133) to read time entry data for the identified employee (Emma Lefèvre).
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and role resolution function to confirm the current user context (employee_id, department, system_roles). Using the resolved identity and the target_employee_id from Step 1, evaluate authorization rules for reading time_entry records (not salary data). Since the current user is in the Human Resources department, verify that this role is allowed to view another employee's time entries under the company policies. Explicitly ensure no salary or confidential human resources notes are requested. If access is allowed, proceed; if denied, note the denial reason and prepare for a possible security-based abort. This step is purely a permission check and does not perform any data retrieval beyond what is required to check roles.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"current_user_id": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_department": {"type": "string"}, "current_user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "target_employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "allowed_to_view_time_entries": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["current_user_id", "allowed_to_view_time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 to check permissions and access restrictions for the current authenticated user to read time entry data for Emma Lefèvre. 

I executed the step instruction as follows:

1. **Called who_am_i()** to confirm current user context: employee_id=Bhwa_133, department=Human Resources (HR), location=HQ – Italy, is_public=False (authenticated).

2. **Retrieved target employee information** from Step 1: target_employee_id=Bhwa_024 (Emma Lefèvre).

3. **Attempted to retrieve system_roles**: The available functions (who_am_i() and get_employee()) do not expose system_roles fields. The EmployeeFull model and WhoAmI model do not contain system_roles attributes. Therefore, current_user_roles is returned as an empty array [].

4. **Evaluated authorization rules** based on company policies:
   - No explicit rules restrict HR department from reading time entry data for reporting purposes
   - The task involves reading time entries only, not salary or confidential HR notes
   - HR typically requires access to time data for reporting, compliance, and analytics
   - The user is authenticated and belongs to the HR department

5. **Verified no salary or confidential HR notes are requested**: The task explicitly only involves time entry data, not sensitive information.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Current user context from who_am_i()
- Target employee details from get_employee("Bhwa_024")
- No state-changing operations were performed
- No assumptions were made beyond what the functions explicitly returned

Therefore, the current user is allowed to view time entries for the target employee.

{
  "current_user_id": "Bhwa_133",
  "current_user_department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "target_employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "allowed_to_view_time_entries": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve all time_entry records for the identified employee between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28 (inclusive), including billable flag and hours.
Approach: Assuming permissions from Step 2 are granted, query the time_entry table for rows where employee_id equals the target_employee_id from Step 1 and entry_date is between '2025-02-01' and '2025-02-28' inclusive. Do not introduce any additional filters on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided entries) because the task asks literally for hours logged. Select at least: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, customer_id, project_id. Use exact matching for employee_id. If no records are found, return an empty list but still include the date range in the output context.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "time_entries": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"id": {"type": "string"}, "entry_date": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable": {"type": "boolean"}, "status": {"type": "string"}, "customer_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}, "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]}}, "required": ["id", "entry_date", "hours", "billable", "status"]}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "time_entries"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 3 to retrieve all time entry records for Emma Lefèvre (employee_id: Bhwa_024) between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28. The step was executed as follows:

1. **Verified the employee exists**: Confirmed that employee Bhwa_024 (Emma Lefèvre) exists in the system.

2. **Queried time entries**: Used the `search_time_entries` function with parameters:
   - `employee="Bhwa_024"` (target employee)
   - `date_from="2025-02-01"` and `date_to="2025-02-28"` (inclusive date range)
   - No filters on status or billable flag (to include all entries)

3. **Results**: Found exactly 3 time entries for the specified period. The function returned all entries in a single batch (no pagination needed).

4. **Entry details**: All 3 entries have been captured with their complete information including ID, date, hours, billable status, entry status, customer ID, and project ID.

The search was comprehensive and no additional filters were applied, ensuring we captured all time entries logged by Emma Lefèvre during February 2025.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_010",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-03",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_011",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-10",
      "hours": 2.0,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_012",
      "entry_date": "2025-02-21",
      "hours": 4.5,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Compute the total hours logged, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours for the specified period based on the retrieved time entries.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 3, iterate through each entry and sum the hours for all records to compute the total_hours. Separately, sum hours where billable is true to obtain billable_hours, and sum hours where billable is false to obtain non_billable_hours. Use precise decimal arithmetic to avoid rounding errors. Do not exclude any entries based on status. If there are no entries, all totals should be zero. Optionally cross-check the results by also performing an SQL aggregation (GROUP BY billable) to validate consistency, but keep this step's primary goal as the calculation of totals.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 4 to compute the total hours logged by Emma Lefèvre between February 1-28, 2025, and break them down into billable and non-billable hours.

Using the 3 time entries retrieved in Step 3:
1. Entry te_010 (2025-02-03): 3.0 hours, billable = true
2. Entry te_011 (2025-02-10): 2.0 hours, billable = false  
3. Entry te_012 (2025-02-21): 4.5 hours, billable = true

Calculation:
- Total hours = 3.0 + 2.0 + 4.5 = 9.5 hours
- Billable hours = 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5 hours
- Non-billable hours = 2.0 hours

I cross-verified the calculation using the `time_summary_by_employee` function, which returned identical results, confirming the accuracy of the computation.

All calculations used precise decimal arithmetic as required, and no rounding errors were introduced.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare the final answer summarizing how many total hours Emma Lefèvre logged between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, and how many of those hours were billable versus non-billable.
Approach: Combine the computed values from Step 4 with the verified employee name and date range to construct a clear, human-readable summary. Explicitly state the date range (inclusive), the total number of hours logged, the subset that is billable, and the subset that is non-billable. Ensure the response does not expose any additional sensitive information beyond these aggregates. Include the numeric values again in a machine-readable structure alongside the narrative text.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "date_range_start": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "date_range_end": {"type": "string", "format": "date"}, "answer_text": {"type": "string"}, "total_hours": {"type": "number"}, "billable_hours": {"type": "number"}, "non_billable_hours": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_name", "employee_id", "date_range_start", "date_range_end", "answer_text", "total_hours", "billable_hours", "non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I have successfully completed Step 5 to prepare the final answer summarizing Emma Lefèvre's logged hours between February 1-28, 2025. All facts were verified through function calls:

1. Verified employee name by calling `get_employee("Bhwa_024")` which returned "Emma Lefèvre"
2. Used the exact calculated values from Step 4: total_hours=9.5, billable_hours=7.5, non_billable_hours=2.0
3. Constructed a human-readable summary that explicitly states the date range, total hours, billable hours, and non-billable hours
4. Ensured no sensitive information beyond the required aggregates was exposed

All values in the JSON output are directly derived from verified function returns or previous step results. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_name": "Emma Lefèvre",
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
  "date_range_start": "2025-02-01",
  "date_range_end": "2025-02-28",
  "answer_text": "Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "billable_hours": 7.5,
  "non_billable_hours": 2.0
}

### Final Result
Between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28, Emma Lefèvre logged a total of 9.5 hours. Of these, 7.5 hours were billable and 2.0 hours were non-billable.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
