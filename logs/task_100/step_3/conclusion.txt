I have successfully completed Step 3 to retrieve all time entry records for Emma Lefèvre (employee_id: Bhwa_024) between 2025-02-01 and 2025-02-28. The step was executed as follows:

1. **Verified the employee exists**: Confirmed that employee Bhwa_024 (Emma Lefèvre) exists in the system.

2. **Queried time entries**: Used the `search_time_entries` function with parameters:
   - `employee="Bhwa_024"` (target employee)
   - `date_from="2025-02-01"` and `date_to="2025-02-28"` (inclusive date range)
   - No filters on status or billable flag (to include all entries)

3. **Results**: Found exactly 3 time entries for the specified period. The function returned all entries in a single batch (no pagination needed).

4. **Entry details**: All 3 entries have been captured with their complete information including ID, date, hours, billable status, entry status, customer ID, and project ID.

The search was comprehensive and no additional filters were applied, ensuring we captured all time entries logged by Emma Lefèvre during February 2025.
