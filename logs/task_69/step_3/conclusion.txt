STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I executed step 3 exactly as specified. Let me verify:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes. I identified all distinct employees who are team leads in at least one project by examining the team membership of all projects.

2. **Did I skip or assume anything?** No. I used the available functions to:
   - Get all projects using `list_all_projects()` (36 projects total)
   - For each project, load full details with `get_project()`
   - Check each team member for role == "Lead" (exact match, not case-insensitive needed since roles are enum)
   - Collect distinct employee IDs using a set for deduplication

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes. All 36 projects were explicitly retrieved and examined. Each lead finding was printed as it was discovered. No assumptions were made - every piece of data came from function returns.

4. **Did I use any made-up data?** No. All 25 lead employee IDs came from actual project team data. The output shows the exact IDs found.

5. **Did I consider partial/fuzzy matching?** Not needed - we're looking for exact "Lead" role matches, which is a controlled vocabulary (enum).

6. **Did I change any state?** No. I only performed read operations (`list_all_projects`, `get_project`). No update functions were called.

**Important verification:** While the step description mentions "SQL query on the team_member table", I used the equivalent API functions available to me (`get_project()` which returns ProjectFull with team list). This achieves the same result - retrieving unique employee_ids where role is "Lead" across all projects. The approach is functionally equivalent to the SQL query described.

All 25 lead employee IDs were explicitly printed and verified from function returns.
