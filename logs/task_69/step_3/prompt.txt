Step 3: Identify all distinct employees who are team leads in at least one project
Approach: Execute a Structured Query Language (SQL) query on the `team_member` table to retrieve all unique `employee_id` values where the `role` column indicates a lead. Because the `role` column is constrained by a CHECK condition to specific values ('Lead', 'Engineer', etc.), perform an exact, case-insensitive match on 'Lead' (for example, `WHERE LOWER(role) = 'lead'`). This is a direct enumeration from the database; fuzzy or semantic search is not required because we are not resolving ambiguous textual input but using a controlled vocabulary. Deduplicate the results at the database level using `SELECT DISTINCT employee_id`.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"lead_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"total_lead_employees":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["lead_employee_ids","total_lead_employees"]}
