Step 1: Understand which internal systems and database tables will be used to identify team leads and to create wiki pages, and confirm that they are suitable for this task
Approach: Review the provided Structured Query Language (SQL) table definitions to identify where team lead information and wiki content are stored. Specifically, confirm that the `team_member` table contains project roles (including the 'Lead' role) and that the `wiki_file` table stores wiki pages (with `path` and `content` fields). No fuzzy or semantic search is required here because we are not searching by ambiguous or user-provided text, only inspecting schema definitions.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_team_member_table":{"type":"boolean"},"has_wiki_file_table":{"type":"boolean"},"usable_for_task":{"type":"boolean"},"details":{"type":"string"}},"required":["has_team_member_table","has_wiki_file_table","usable_for_task"]}
