I have executed the step to understand which internal systems and database tables will be used to identify team leads and create wiki pages. Through direct examination of the available functions and data structures, I have verified the following:

1. **Team Member Information**: The project system contains a `ProjectFull` data structure with a `team` field that stores `TeamMember` objects. Each `TeamMember` has `employee`, `time_slice`, and `role` fields. The `role` field can be "Lead" (as verified by examining actual projects where we found multiple leads).

2. **Wiki System**: The wiki system has functions `list_wiki`, `load_wiki`, and `update_wiki` that operate on wiki files with `path` and `content` fields. I verified this by loading an actual wiki file and examining its structure.

3. **Task Suitability**: Both systems are suitable for the task. We can query all projects to identify employees with "Lead" roles, and we can create wiki pages using the `update_wiki` function with the specified format "leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md".

All facts were explicitly verified through function calls, and no assumptions were made.

{
  "has_team_member_table": true,
  "has_wiki_file_table": true,
  "usable_for_task": true,
  "details": "Verified through function calls: ProjectFull objects contain team lists with TeamMember objects having role field (including 'Lead'). Wiki system has update_wiki function that accepts file_path and content parameters. Confirmed by examining actual projects showing leads (bAsk_039, bAsk_006, bAsk_048) and loading wiki files. Both systems are accessible and suitable for identifying project leads and creating wiki pages."
