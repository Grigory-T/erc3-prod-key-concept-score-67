DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:23:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 executed successfully and produced the expected outputs showing both the team member and wiki file systems exist and are suitable, with explicit evidence supporting this. There were no errors or unexpected results, and all information strictly matches the requirements for continuing to the next step (user permissions and identity check). No new risks or gaps appeared; the original plan remains fully appropriate and executable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:27:43
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have both completed successfully, with results precisely matching the expected outputs in the original plan. All required systems and permissions are present and available. There are no abnormal results, missing information, or policy violations that would necessitate replanning or aborting. The remaining steps can proceed exactly as written in the original plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:29:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1-3 were executed as specified and produced the expected results. All necessary systems and structures exist and are usable. Employee IDs for project leads were successfully identified and verified as coming from actual project data. No errors, unexpected results, or missing functions have occurred. There are no discrepancies or reasons to abort or replan. The next logical action is to proceed to step 4 per the Original Plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:31:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been executed exactly as specified in the original plan and have produced expected, correct, and directly verified results. No anomalies, missing information, or discrepancies have been observed. Step 5 (checking which wiki pages already exist) is the next logical action, and all preceding outputs are in the expected format and content for this step. The plan remains strictly applicable and there is no reason to alter it.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:34:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced the expected results, strictly following the original plan. The systems and tables are suitable and available (Step 1), the user has the required permissions (Step 2), all lead employee IDs have been found and validated (Steps 3 and 4), and none of the required wiki pages exist (Step 5). The next step (Step 6) is a decision checkpoint to verify if any abort conditions are triggered before proceeding to page creation. No unexpected results, inconsistencies, or policy conflicts have been observed. Therefore, the current plan should proceed directly to Step 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:35:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task has progressed through all validation and authorization steps as outlined in the original plan, and each step produced the expected output without discrepancies or missing data. Required capabilities, permissions, and data integrity have been confirmed, and there are no blockers or unexpected findings. Step 7 (the remaining step) can be completed with the current inputs. According to the original rules, when all steps so far match expectations and the plan is still valid, the next step should be executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:41:40
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been fully and successfully executed with results strictly matching the expected outputs for each step. All requirements and company policies were followed precisely (regarding permission, data sensitivity, and roles). All 25 team lead wiki pages have been created, none were skipped or required correction, and verification confirms completion. There are no remaining steps or open issues. The task is completed with full traceability.
