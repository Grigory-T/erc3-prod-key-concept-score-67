Step 2 completed. I determined the current authenticated user identity and analyzed their permissions for reading project membership and writing wiki pages based on company rules.

The user is Stefania Serra (ID: bAsk_133) from the Human Resources (HR) department at HQ – Italy. Based on her department and the company rules, I inferred she likely has the 'HRAdmin' system role. 

Regarding permissions:
1. Reading projects: No explicit restrictions were found in the company rules for reading project data and team membership, so she can read projects.
2. Writing wiki pages: The rules only restrict wiki writes when they contain sensitive personal data, not based on roles. Therefore, she can write wiki pages as long as the content doesn't contain sensitive information.

All information was obtained through the `who_am_i()` function and `get_employee()` call, with permissions analyzed against the provided company rules.
