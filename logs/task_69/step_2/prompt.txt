Step 2: Determine current authenticated user identity and permissions relevant to reading project membership and writing wiki pages
Approach: Call an internal identity endpoint (for example, a `who_am_i` function) to retrieve the current authenticated employee record for user `bAsk_133` (Stefania Serra), including department, location, and system roles such as 'Human Resources Admin', 'Information Technology Admin', 'Project Admin', or any wiki-specific roles. Based on company rules, infer whether this user is allowed to read from `project` and `team_member` tables and to insert or update rows in `wiki_file`. This step must not access salary information. No fuzzy or semantic search is required because the user identity is taken directly from the bound session context.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"can_write_wiki":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_projects","can_write_wiki"]}
