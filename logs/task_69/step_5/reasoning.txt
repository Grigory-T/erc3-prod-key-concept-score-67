We are at Step 5: Determine for each lead employee whether the corresponding wiki page leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md already exists.
 We have the validated_lead_employee_ids from Step 4: 25 employee IDs.
 For each employee_id, construct path: f"leads/{employee_id}.md"
 Then check if that wiki file exists by using list_wiki() to get all wiki paths, and then check if the constructed path is in the list.
 However, note that we have a function `load_wiki(file_path)` which returns content if exists, else None. But the step says to query the wiki_file table.
 We don't have a direct SQL query, but we can simulate by using `load_wiki` and checking for None, or by listing all wiki paths and checking.
 Since `list_wiki()` returns a list of all wiki file paths, we can use that to check existence without loading each file's content.
 We'll do:
   all_wiki_paths = list_wiki()
   Then for each employee_id, set exists = path in all_wiki_paths

 But note: The step says "query the wiki_file table with an exact equality filter on path". We don't have a direct query function for that, so using `list_wiki` and then checking is acceptable.

 However, the function `list_wiki()` returns a list of strings (paths). We can use that.

 Let's break down:
 1. Get the list of all wiki paths.
 2. For each employee_id in validated_lead_employee_ids, construct the path.
 3. Check if the path is in the list of wiki paths.

 We must output a list of objects with employee_id, path, and exists (boolean).

 Also, we must not change any state, only read.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll also print the results for verification.

 Important: The step does not require fuzzy search because we are using exact paths.

 Let's execute.

We need to return the result in the specified JSON format.
 We have an array of objects for each lead employee with employee_id, path, and exists (boolean).
 We also need total_checked.

 From the output, we have 25 employees checked and none of the wiki pages exist.

 Let's construct the JSON accordingly.

The user asks for verification of step 5 execution. I need to review if I followed the step correctly.

Step 5: Determine for each lead employee whether the corresponding wiki page leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md already exists.

Approach: For each employee_id in validated lead list, construct path "leads/employee_id.md". Query wiki_file table with exact equality on path. No fuzzy search needed.

I did:

- Used validated_lead_employee_ids from step 4 (25 IDs).
- Called list_wiki() to get all existing wiki paths (19 files).
- For each employee_id, constructed path, checked if path in existing_wiki_paths.
- Printed results: all 25 paths do not exist.

But wait: The step says "query the wiki_file table with an exact equality filter on path". I used list_wiki() which returns list of paths. That's equivalent to selecting all paths and then checking membership. However, the step might imply directly querying for each path (like load_wiki(path) to see if it exists). But list_wiki returns all paths, so checking membership is fine. However, I should verify that there is no function to check existence directly. The available functions are list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki, update_wiki. load_wiki returns None if file doesn't exist. That might be a more direct query. The step says "query the wiki_file table with an exact equality filter on path". That could be simulated by load_wiki(path) and checking if it returns content or None. But using list_wiki is also fine because it returns all paths, and we can check inclusion. However, list_wiki might not show all paths if there are many? It returns all wiki file paths (no pagination mentioned). The function signature: list_wiki() -> list[str]. So it returns all.

But maybe there is a nuance: The step says "For each constructed path, query the wiki_file table with an exact equality filter on path". That suggests individual queries per path. But in practice, I did one query to get all paths, then checked each. That's acceptable because it's equivalent to multiple exact equality filters (I can check each path against the list). However, if the wiki has many files, list_wiki might be inefficient, but we have only 19.

But I should consider: Could there be a wiki file with path "leads/bAsk_032.md" that is not returned by list_wiki? That seems unlikely. However, I should double-check by actually trying to load one of these paths to confirm non-existence. The step says "query the wiki_file table with an exact equality filter on path". That is essentially load_wiki(path) and see if it returns something. load_wiki returns None if not found. That might be more accurate.

I should verify by sampling a few paths with load_wiki. But the step does not require that; it just says determine whether it exists. My method determines existence by checking if path is in list_wiki(). That should be correct.

But the user's verification checklist asks: "Are all facts verified (not assumed)?" I assumed that if a path is not in list_wiki, it does not exist. That is a fact from the function return: list_wiki returns all existing paths. So if a path is not in that list, it does not exist. That is verified.

Also: "If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc." The paths we are looking for are not found. Should I double-check with fuzzy matching? The step explicitly says "fuzzy, partial, or semantic search is not required and should not be used." So I should not use fuzzy matching.

But maybe there is a chance that the path is stored with a different case or formatting? The paths are constructed exactly as "leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md". Employee IDs are like "bAsk_032". They are case-sensitive. The existing wiki paths shown are lowercase like "business/marketing_and_sales_approach.md". So they are all lowercase. Our constructed paths have mixed case (bAsk). Could the wiki system be case-sensitive? Possibly. But we are checking exact equality, so case matters. If the wiki stores paths with case-insensitivity, then our check might be wrong. However, we have no evidence. The step says exact equality filter, so we assume case-sensitive.

To be thorough, I could try loading one of these paths with load_wiki to see if it returns content. That would be a direct check. Let's do that for a sample.

I'll write additional code to verify using load_wiki for a few paths. But note: update functions are state-changing, but load_wiki is read-only, safe.

I'll do a quick check for a couple of paths to confirm. If load_wiki returns None, then indeed the file does not exist.

Also, I should check if there are any existing files in the "leads/" directory at all. Maybe there are some leads files but with different naming? But the step says exactly "leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md". We are to check that exact path. So we don't need to search for variations.

Nevertheless, to be thorough, I'll execute a small verification.

But the user says: "If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks."

I am sure about the results because I followed the approach: constructed paths, checked against list_wiki. All 25 do not exist. I printed the list_wiki output and saw no "leads/" paths.

However, to be extra cautious, I can quickly run a check using load_wiki for a few random IDs.

Let me do that in a new code block. But note: I must not change state. load_wiki is safe.

I'll write a small verification snippet.

We have already executed step 5 and provided the output. Now, the verification step asks to confirm that we have done everything correctly.

Let's review the checklist:

1. Did you execute the step instruction?
   - Yes, we constructed the path for each employee ID and checked existence by comparing with the list of existing wiki paths.

2. Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
   - We did not skip any action. We used the list of validated employee IDs, constructed the paths, and checked against the existing wiki paths.

3. Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
   - Yes, we used the function `list_wiki()` to get all existing wiki paths and then checked for each constructed path.

However, note that the step description says to query the `wiki_file` table with an exact equality filter. We used the available function `list_wiki()` which returns all paths, and then we checked for membership. This is equivalent to querying for exact equality because we are checking if the path is in the list.

Additionally, we performed an extra verification by using `load_wiki` on a sample of paths and also checked for any files in the 'leads/' directory. This confirms that there are no existing files in the leads directory.

The JSON response we provided contains only the values that were explicitly printed/verified.

We did not change any state (only read operations).

Therefore, we are confident in our results.

We will now repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
