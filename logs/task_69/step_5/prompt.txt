Step 5: Determine for each lead employee whether the corresponding wiki page leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md already exists
Approach: For each `employee_id` in the validated lead list, construct the expected wiki path exactly as `"leads/" || employee_id || ".md"` (for example, `leads/elena_vogel.md`). For each constructed path, query the `wiki_file` table with an exact equality filter on `path` (for example, `SELECT path FROM wiki_file WHERE path = ?`). This search is deterministic and based on identifiers directly from the database, so fuzzy, partial, or semantic search is not required and should not be used. Collect a list indicating, for each employee, whether a wiki file already exists at that path.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"lead_pages":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"path":{"type":"string"},"exists":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","path","exists"]}},"total_checked":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["lead_pages","total_checked"]}
