STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 22:34:23

I have executed step 5 exactly as specified and verified the results through additional checks. 

**Execution summary:**
1. For each of the 25 validated lead employee IDs from step 4, I constructed the wiki path as `"leads/" + employee_id + ".md"`
2. I queried the wiki system using `list_wiki()` to get all existing wiki file paths (19 files total)
3. For each constructed path, I checked for exact equality with the existing paths to determine existence
4. All 25 paths were checked, and none exist (all `exists: false`)

**Additional verification performed:**
- Used `load_wiki()` on a sample of 5 paths to directly check existence (all returned `None`)
- Checked if any files exist in the "leads/" directory (none found)

**Key findings:**
- Total existing wiki files: 19
- Files in "leads/" directory: 0
- All 25 lead employee wiki pages need to be created

No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used. All facts were verified through function returns.
