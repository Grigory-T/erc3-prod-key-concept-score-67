Step 6: Decide whether the task can proceed or must be aborted based on earlier capability and permission checks
Approach: Evaluate the outputs of steps 1 and 2 together: confirm that the necessary tables (`team_member` and `wiki_file`) exist and are usable (`usable_for_task` is true), and that the current user has permission to write to the `wiki_file` table (`can_write_wiki` is true). If either condition is false, schedule an abort for the task and record a clear, non-sensitive abort reason such as 'wiki write operations not permitted for current user' or 'wiki_file table not available'. This step does not perform any database writes; it only evaluates conditions and prepares the decision. No fuzzy or semantic search is involved.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["will_abort","abort_reason"]}
