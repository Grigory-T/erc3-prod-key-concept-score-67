STEP 6 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:35:22

I have executed Step 6 exactly as specified. The step required evaluating the outputs of Steps 1 and 2 to decide whether to proceed or abort the task. I:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: Evaluated the two required conditions by checking the documented results from Steps 1 and 2.

2. **Did not skip or assume anything**: Used only the verified outputs from the previous steps:
   - From Step 1: `usable_for_task` = true (confirming necessary tables exist and are usable)
   - From Step 2: `can_write_wiki` = true (confirming user has wiki write permission)

3. **Verified all facts**: All values were explicitly printed in the execution results and come directly from the function returns of previous steps. No assumptions or made-up data were used.

Both conditions are true, so the decision is to proceed without aborting.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step; only evaluation of existing data.

{
  "will_abort": false,
  "abort_reason": null
}
