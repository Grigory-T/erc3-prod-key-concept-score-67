Step 4: Validate that each lead employee identifier corresponds to an existing employee record and normalize the final list of lead employee identifiers
Approach: Using the list of `employee_id` values from the previous step, query the `employee` table with a Structured Query Language (SQL) statement such as `SELECT id FROM employee WHERE id IN (...)`. Because `team_member.employee_id` references `employee(id)` through a foreign key, all should exist, but this step explicitly confirms consistency and filters out any anomalous records if present. This lookup is by exact identifier, so fuzzy or semantic search is not required. Produce a cleaned list of valid `employee_id` values to be used for wiki file path construction.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"validated_lead_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"invalid_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"total_validated":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["validated_lead_employee_ids","invalid_employee_ids","total_validated"]}
