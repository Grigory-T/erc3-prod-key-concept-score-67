STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

I have re-verified the execution of step 4 and confirm that all instructions were followed exactly:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I used the list of 25 employee IDs from step 3 and validated each one by querying the employee table using the `get_employee()` function for each ID.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: I explicitly called `get_employee()` for every single ID in the list, printed the validation result for each, and collected the outcomes.

3. **All facts verified**: All 25 employee IDs were confirmed to exist in the system by direct function calls. Each validation was printed with the employee's name, showing that the employee records were successfully retrieved.

4. **No made-up data**: All results come from actual function returns - the 25 valid IDs and 0 invalid IDs.

5. **No state changes**: Only read operations (`get_employee`) were performed; no update functions were called.

The validation confirms that all team lead IDs correspond to existing employee records, resulting in a cleaned/normalized list of 25 valid employee IDs for wiki file path construction.
