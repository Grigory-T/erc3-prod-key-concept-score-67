Step 7: Create wiki pages leads/EMPLOYEE_ID.md with content 'TBD' (no newline) for each lead employee that does not yet have such a page, if not aborted
Approach: If the decision from step 6 indicates that the task should not be aborted (`will_abort` is false), iterate over the `lead_pages` list from step 5 and, for each entry where `exists` is false, insert a new row into the `wiki_file` table. For each new row, set `path` to the exact constructed path (for example, `leads/elena_vogel.md`), set `content` to the exact string `TBD` with no trailing newline character, compute the Secure Hash Algorithm 1 (SHA-1) hash of the string `TBD` and store it in the `sha1` column, and allow `updated_at` to default or be set to the current timestamp according to system conventions. Do not modify existing wiki files where `exists` is true, to align literally with the instruction to create pages rather than update them. Ensure that no sensitive personal data (such as individual salaries or confidential human resources notes) is written into the wiki. No fuzzy or semantic search is required in this step because all paths and contents are explicitly defined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"created_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"skipped_existing_count":{"type":"integer"},"total_created":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["created_paths","skipped_existing_count","total_created"]}
