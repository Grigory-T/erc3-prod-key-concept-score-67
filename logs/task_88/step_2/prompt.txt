Step 2: Search the employee table for an employee whose name corresponds to "Roberto Caruso" in order to find their contact email address as an internal employee, accounting for possible misspellings or variations in the name.
Approach: Query the employee table in the EmployeeRegistry using a multi-stage search strategy. First, attempt an exact match on employee.name equal to "Roberto Caruso" (case-insensitive). If no exact match is found, progressively relax filters: search where the normalized (lowercase, trimmed) string "roberto caruso" is contained in employee.name. If still not found or ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare) and **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee.name that can account for minor misspellings, transposed characters, or additional middle names, and if available also search alternative fields like id or email local-part containing patterns like "roberto" and "caruso". If multiple candidates are found, keep all of them for later disambiguation. Do not access or return salary or notes fields; restrict candidate data to id, name, email, location, and department only.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email"]}},"search_term":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employees","search_term"]}
