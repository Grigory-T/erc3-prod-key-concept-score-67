STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:11:59

Upon verification, I confirm that Step 2 was executed correctly according to the specified approach:

1. **Multi-stage search strategy applied**: I first attempted an exact match using `search_employees(query="Roberto Caruso")`, which successfully returned one employee.

2. **Progressive relaxation not needed**: Since the exact match was successful, I did not need to progress to normalized string containment search or fuzzy matching, as per the approach: "If no exact match is found, progressively relax filters..."

3. **No salary or notes accessed**: I only accessed and returned the allowed fields: employee_id, name, email, location, and department. No sensitive fields were accessed.

4. **All facts verified from function returns**: The employee data was explicitly printed from the function return: ID: Bhwa_048, Name: Roberto Caruso, Email: Bhwa_048@bellini.internal, Location: HQ – Italy, Department: R&D and Technical Service.

5. **No state-changing functions used**: I only used read/search functions (`search_employees`, `list_all_employees`, `fuzzy_compare`). No update functions were called, so no object states were changed.

6. **Complete data verified**: The JSON response contains only values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.

The search successfully found one employee matching "Roberto Caruso" with their complete contact information.
