Step 1 completed. I have retrieved the current authenticated user information confirming that the actor is an internal employee (not a public or guest user). The user details have been gathered for later permission checks. Note: The available functions do not provide a direct way to retrieve system_roles, so this field is returned as an empty array.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "name": "Viola Messina",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "is_public": false
}
