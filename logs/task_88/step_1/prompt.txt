Step 1: Retrieve current authenticated user information (who_am_i) to confirm that the current actor is an internal employee (not a public or guest user) and to obtain their roles, department, and location for later permission checks.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session service (who_am_i) or equivalent to fetch the current user record bound to this chatbot session. Use exact retrieval via the session token or context, not by fuzzy matching. Confirm that is_public is false and record user.id, user.name, user.department, user.location, and user.system_roles. This step does not access any target employee data yet; it only gathers the acting user's identity and authorization context.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"is_public":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","name","department","location","system_roles","is_public"]}
