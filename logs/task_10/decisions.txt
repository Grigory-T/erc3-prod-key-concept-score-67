DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:31:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 is complete and the results match expectations and requirements of the plan, except for the absence of the system_roles field. However, there is no failure or unacceptable result: the process still retrieved the current user data as intended, and the lack of system_roles is due to API limitation, not task impossibility. This limitation should be considered in the next steps, but according to both company rules and the plan, the next step is to resolve the location. There is no indication that the rest of the steps cannot be completed, and the plan remains valid. Therefore, the correct decision is to continue with the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:33:45
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have executed successfully and have produced the expected results according to the Original Plan. The necessary location ('Paris Office – France') was found unambiguously. No discrepancies, missing functions, or abnormal data were identified. The remaining steps can clearly be completed as planned. No replanning or abort is necessary at this point; the plan remains valid and actionable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:36:26
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed steps have all produced the expected outputs precisely as described in the plan. There are no discrepancies or missing information: the current user has been identified, the Paris office location has been resolved unambiguously, and a valid list of employees at that location has been retrieved with correct fields. The next step (step 4) is to check authorization for reading non-confidential workload info. No problems or unexpected results have been encountered, so the plan remains valid and execution should continue to the next step per instructions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:39:02
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have executed according to the original plan, and each step yielded expected, relevant results with no discrepancies or blockers. Permission to access the necessary data has been verified. There are no errors or obstacles. Therefore, the plan is still valid, and the next step should be executed as written.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:43:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have executed exactly as described in the original plan and each step produced complete and expected results. The only remaining step is to select the employee(s) from the Paris Office with the minimum total workload, and all data required to do so (employee list with IDs, emails, departments, and their total workloads) is already available. No errors, missing data, inconsistencies, or unexpected results have been encountered. The requirements for the final step are fully met, so there is no need to replan, abort, or adjust the workflow. Proceed to the next (and final) step as originally planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:45:28
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed exactly as specified, with successful retrieval and verification at each stage. There are no remaining steps. The final result unambiguously identifies the least busy employees at the Paris Office – France, including all required employee information and their workload. No discrepancies or need for replanning. The task is complete according to the original plan and company rules.
