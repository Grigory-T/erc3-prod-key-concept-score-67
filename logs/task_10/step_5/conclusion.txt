I have successfully executed Step 5: Compute the total workload for each employee at the Paris office by summing time_slice values from the team_member table.

I followed the step instruction by:
1. Using the Paris office employee IDs from Step 3: ["6KR2_020", "6KR2_021", "6KR2_022", "6KR2_023", "6KR2_024"]
2. Querying the team_member table indirectly through project data by examining all 36 projects in the system
3. Using exact matching on employee_id to find team members for each Paris employee
4. Performing fuzzy matching to check for potential inconsistencies or variations in employee IDs
5. Summing time_slice values for each employee, treating missing entries as 0.0

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Total unique employee IDs in team members: 68
- Fuzzy comparison showed exact matches for 6KR2_020, 6KR2_022, and 6KR2_024 (ratio 1.000)
- No exact matches found for 6KR2_021 and 6KR2_023 in team member IDs
- All near-matches had ratio 0.875, indicating different IDs (e.g., 6KR2_062, 6KR2_120) rather than variations of Paris IDs

The workload calculation is accurate based on exact matching of employee IDs in team member records. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used. No data was invented or assumed.

The results show the total workload (sum of time_slice values) for each Paris office employee:
- 6KR2_020 (Marine Guerin): 0.7 (in 2 projects)
- 6KR2_021 (Agathe Marty): 0.0 (no team member entries)
- 6KR2_022 (Pierre Mercier): 0.3 (in 1 project)
- 6KR2_023 (Olivier André): 0.0 (no team member entries)
- 6KR2_024 (Laurent Pons): 0.3 (in 1 project)

These results provide the complete workload information for identifying the least busy employee at the Paris Office in subsequent steps.
