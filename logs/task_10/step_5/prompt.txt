Step 5: Compute the total workload for each employee at the Paris office by summing time_slice values from the team_member table.
Approach: Assuming permission is granted in step 4 and there is at least one employee from step 3, query the team_member table for all rows where employee_id is in the list of Paris office employee ids. Use an exact match on employee_id (it is a foreign key) but if inconsistencies are detected (for example, some ids appear truncated), double-check with fuzzy and semantic / logical matching between team_member.employee_id and employee.id to ensure no valid links are missed. Group results by employee_id and compute SUM(time_slice) for each; for employees with no team_member rows, explicitly treat their total_time_slice as 0.0 to reflect no allocated workload. Return a list mapping each employee_id to its aggregated total_time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["workloads"]}
