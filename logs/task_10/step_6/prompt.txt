Step 6: Determine the least busy employee or employees at the Paris office based on the minimum total_time_slice and prepare the final result.
Approach: From the workloads list in step 5, find the minimum total_time_slice value. Select all employees whose total_time_slice equals this minimum (to handle ties). Join these employee_ids back to the employee information from step 3 (id, name, email, location, department) using exact matching on id. If, for any selected employee_id, the basic info is missing due to earlier fuzzy matching, perform a final fuzzy and semantic / logical reconciliation between the workload employee_id and employee table to fill in missing data where possible. Output the minimal workload value and an array of least busy employees with their basic information and associated total_time_slice.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"min_total_time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"least_busy_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":["string","null"]},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","email","total_time_slice"]}}},"required":["least_busy_employees"]}
