Step 4: Check that the current user (id 6KR2_139, department Finance and Administration) has permission to read non-confidential workload information (team_member.time_slice and basic employee fields) for employees at the Paris office.
Approach: Using the user identity and system_roles from step 1 and the list of target employee ids from step 3, run an authorization check against company policies to confirm that reading non-confidential data (employee basic fields and team_member.time_slice) is permitted. Verify that no salary or confidential human resources notes will be accessed. Since the policies restrict salaries and mutations but do not explicitly restrict read-only access to team_member, this step should confirm read access or, if policies deny it, mark the operation as denied_security and prevent subsequent data access.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permitted":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"},"affected_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["permitted","reason"]}
