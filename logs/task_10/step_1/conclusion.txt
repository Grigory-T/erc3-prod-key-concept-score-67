I have executed the step instruction exactly as described. I called the `who_am_i()` function to retrieve the current user context and then used `get_employee()` to get the full profile of the current user with the exact ID '6KR2_139'. I did not skip any actions or make any assumptions about the data. All facts were explicitly verified from function returns.

However, I encountered a limitation: while I successfully retrieved the user_id, name, department, and location, the available API functions do not expose a `system_roles` field. I thoroughly examined both the `WhoAmI` object returned by `who_am_i()` and the `EmployeeFull` object returned by `get_employee()`, and neither contains a system_roles attribute or any role-related fields.

Despite attempting different approaches to find role information, the system_roles data appears to be bound from EmployeeRegistry internally (as mentioned in company rules) but is not accessible through the provided API functions.

All values in the JSON response are explicitly printed and verified from function returns. The system_roles array is empty because no role information could be retrieved through the available functions.

{
  "user_id": "6KR2_139",
  "name": "Giorgia Ricci",
  "department": "Finance & Administration",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
