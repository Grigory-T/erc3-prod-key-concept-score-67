Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Giorgia Ricci, id 6KR2_139) and retrieve her roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry (who_am_i).
Approach: Call the internal identity or EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i) to retrieve the full profile of the current user with id '6KR2_139'. Use exact matching on the employee.id field for this lookup. Do not access or return salary or confidential human resources notes fields; only retrieve fields necessary for authorization such as id, name, department, location, and system_roles. No fuzzy search is needed here because the user identifier is exact and already known.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
