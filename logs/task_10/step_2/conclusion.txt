I have verified my execution of Step 2. I strictly followed the step instruction by querying for the location 'Paris Office – France' using the available data sources. Since no direct location table query function exists, I used employee and customer data to collect all unique location values, which is consistent with the system's data structure where locations are attributes of employees and customers.

I performed all required search methods:
1. **Exact match**: Found 'Paris Office – France' exactly in employee locations.
2. **Case-insensitive exact match**: Confirmed the same match.
3. **Partial matching**: Found 'France' and 'Paris Office – France' as substring matches.
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied `fuzzy_compare` which gave a perfect ratio of 1.000 for 'Paris Office – France', confirming it as the best match.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns: I printed all unique locations from employees and customers, and the search results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used.

The location 'Paris Office – France' was found unambiguously, with no other high-confidence matches that would cause ambiguity.
