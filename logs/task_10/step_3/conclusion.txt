STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I have successfully executed step 3 as instructed. Using the resolved location name "Paris Office – France" from step 2, I queried the employee table with an exact match on the location field using the `search_employees()` function. The search found 5 employees working at the Paris Office – France location. 

I have now verified all fields by explicitly printing each employee's details. The email field was initially not printed in the first execution, but I have now verified it contains the company internal email addresses (e.g., 6KR2_020@bellini.internal).

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. I returned only the allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as specified, excluding salary and confidential human resources data. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used.
