## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-07-28
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_139
User details: {"id": "6KR2_139", "name": "Giorgia Ricci", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: 6KR2_139
department: Finance & Administration
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-07-28
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who is the least busy employee at Paris Office – France (by total workload/time slices)

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Giorgia Ricci, id 6KR2_139) and retrieve her roles, department, and location from the EmployeeRegistry (who_am_i).
Approach: Call the internal identity or EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i) to retrieve the full profile of the current user with id '6KR2_139'. Use exact matching on the employee.id field for this lookup. Do not access or return salary or confidential human resources notes fields; only retrieve fields necessary for authorization such as id, name, department, location, and system_roles. No fuzzy search is needed here because the user identifier is exact and already known.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction exactly as described. I called the `who_am_i()` function to retrieve the current user context and then used `get_employee()` to get the full profile of the current user with the exact ID '6KR2_139'. I did not skip any actions or make any assumptions about the data. All facts were explicitly verified from function returns.

However, I encountered a limitation: while I successfully retrieved the user_id, name, department, and location, the available API functions do not expose a `system_roles` field. I thoroughly examined both the `WhoAmI` object returned by `who_am_i()` and the `EmployeeFull` object returned by `get_employee()`, and neither contains a system_roles attribute or any role-related fields.

Despite attempting different approaches to find role information, the system_roles data appears to be bound from EmployeeRegistry internally (as mentioned in company rules) but is not accessible through the provided API functions.

All values in the JSON response are explicitly printed and verified from function returns. The system_roles array is empty because no role information could be retrieved through the available functions.

{
  "user_id": "6KR2_139",
  "name": "Giorgia Ricci",
  "department": "Finance & Administration",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Find the correct location record corresponding to 'Paris Office – France' in the location table to ensure we target the right office.
Approach: Query the location table first with an exact match filter WHERE name = 'Paris Office – France'. If no row is found, progressively relax the search using lowercased and whitespace-normalized comparisons, partial matching (e.g., WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%paris%' AND LOWER(name) LIKE '%france%'), and if still ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical search (for example, interpret that 'Paris Office – France' could map to entries like 'Paris', 'Paris, France', or 'France - Paris Office'). Use fuzzy_compare or similar tools to rank candidate locations and select the best match above a reasonable confidence threshold; if multiple candidates with similar high confidence exist, prepare to flag ambiguity. Searching must explicitly account for potential misspellings or variants in the location.name field (fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"location_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified my execution of Step 2. I strictly followed the step instruction by querying for the location 'Paris Office – France' using the available data sources. Since no direct location table query function exists, I used employee and customer data to collect all unique location values, which is consistent with the system's data structure where locations are attributes of employees and customers.

I performed all required search methods:
1. **Exact match**: Found 'Paris Office – France' exactly in employee locations.
2. **Case-insensitive exact match**: Confirmed the same match.
3. **Partial matching**: Found 'France' and 'Paris Office – France' as substring matches.
4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied `fuzzy_compare` which gave a perfect ratio of 1.000 for 'Paris Office – France', confirming it as the best match.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns: I printed all unique locations from employees and customers, and the search results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used.

The location 'Paris Office – France' was found unambiguously, with no other high-confidence matches that would cause ambiguity.

{
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "location_name": "Paris Office – France",
  "candidates": ["Barcelona Office – Spain", "HQ - Italy", "HQ – Italy", "Munich Office – Germany", "Paris Office – France", "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands", "Serbian Plant", "Vienna Office – Austria", "Austria", "Belgium", "Croatia", "Czech Republic", "France", "Germany", "Hungary", "Italy", "Netherlands", "Poland", "Romania", "Serbia", "Spain", "Switzerland"]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Retrieve the list of employees assigned to the resolved 'Paris Office – France' location, excluding salary and confidential human resources data.
Approach: Using the resolved location_name from step 2, query the employee table with an exact match on employee.location = location_name. If no employees are found, confirm by relaxing the filter to allow for small inconsistencies (for example, trimming whitespace or using LOWER(employee.location) for comparison) and, as a last resort, perform a fuzzy and semantic / logical search on the employee.location field to catch potential misspellings like 'Paris Ofice - France'. Only select allowed fields: id, name, email, location, and department. Do not select salary or notes. This step should return a definitive list (possibly empty) of employees working at that office.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","email","location"]}}},"required":["employees"]}

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed step 3 as instructed. Using the resolved location name "Paris Office – France" from step 2, I queried the employee table with an exact match on the location field. The search found 5 employees working at the Paris Office – France location. I returned only the allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as specified, excluding salary and confidential human resources data.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns: I called `search_employees(location="Paris Office – France")` which returned 5 employees. I then prepared the output with the required fields. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Retrieve the list of employees assigned to the resolved 'Paris Office – France' location, excluding salary and confidential human resources data.
Approach: Using the resolved location_name from step 2, query the employee table with an exact match on employee.location = location_name. If no employees are found, confirm by relaxing the filter to allow for small inconsistencies (for example, trimming whitespace or using LOWER(employee.location) for comparison) and, as a last resort, perform a fuzzy and semantic / logical search on the employee.location field to catch potential misspellings like 'Paris Ofice - France'. Only select allowed fields: id, name, email, location, and department. Do not select salary or notes. This step should return a definitive list (possibly empty) of employees working at that office.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","email","location"]}}},"required":["employees"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have successfully executed step 3 as instructed. Using the resolved location name "Paris Office – France" from step 2, I queried the employee table with an exact match on the location field using the `search_employees()` function. The search found 5 employees working at the Paris Office – France location. 

I have now verified all fields by explicitly printing each employee's details. The email field was initially not printed in the first execution, but I have now verified it contains the company internal email addresses (e.g., 6KR2_020@bellini.internal).

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns. I returned only the allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as specified, excluding salary and confidential human resources data. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations were used.
