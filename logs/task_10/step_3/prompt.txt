Step 3: Retrieve the list of employees assigned to the resolved 'Paris Office – France' location, excluding salary and confidential human resources data.
Approach: Using the resolved location_name from step 2, query the employee table with an exact match on employee.location = location_name. If no employees are found, confirm by relaxing the filter to allow for small inconsistencies (for example, trimming whitespace or using LOWER(employee.location) for comparison) and, as a last resort, perform a fuzzy and semantic / logical search on the employee.location field to catch potential misspellings like 'Paris Ofice - France'. Only select allowed fields: id, name, email, location, and department. Do not select salary or notes. This step should return a definitive list (possibly empty) of employees working at that office.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","email","location"]}}},"required":["employees"]}
