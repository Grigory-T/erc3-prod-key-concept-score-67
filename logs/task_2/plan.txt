Steps:
  1. Identify the current user "Noemi Coppola" (employee id "6KR2_043") in the employee table to obtain the authoritative internal employee record that will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.
     Approach: Query the employee table using an exact match on id = "6KR2_043" as the primary key. If no record is found, perform a secondary **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search using the name "Noemi Coppola" and potential variations (case insensitivity, whitespace normalization, partial matches, and tolerance for minor misspellings) across the name and email fields. Do not proceed to later steps if the employee cannot be uniquely identified.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_record":{"type":["object","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
  2. Check internal wiki and documentation for any mention of the initiative or project described as "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" to understand if this is a codename, formal project name, or process description.
     Approach: Search the wiki_file table using the path and content fields for occurrences related to the phrase "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". Use **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search on the content, including breaking the phrase into key components such as "crossover support", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoats", and "Carpathia Metalworks". Account for potential typos and variants (for example, "Carpathian", "Carpatia", "Metal Works"), partial matches, and abbreviation-style references. Extract any referenced project identifiers, customer identifiers, or internal shorthand that clearly relate to this initiative.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matches_found":{"type":"integer"},"related_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customer_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["path"]}}},"required":["matches_found","related_entries"]}
  3. Identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks" in the customer table to establish the correct customer_id for the initiative.
     Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on name = "Carpathia Metalworks". If no exact match is found, perform a **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search over the name and brief fields to find closely matching candidates (handling lowercase, whitespace normalization, partial string inclusion, and minor misspellings such as "Carpatia", "Carpathian Metalworks"). Use a similarity scoring or fuzzy_compare function and select the top candidates above a reasonable confidence threshold. If multiple candidates satisfy the threshold, list them all for potential ambiguity resolution.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["query_name","candidates"]}
  4. Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
     Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing. Collect all projects that plausibly match this initiative, along with a similarity score for traceability of matching quality.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["candidate_projects"]}
  5. Check permissions and team membership of the current user "6KR2_043" for the candidate projects to confirm that she is part of these projects and allowed to view her role.
     Approach: For each project_id from Step 4, query the team_member table with exact matching on employee_id = "6KR2_043" and project_id = that project. Retrieve any matching rows and the associated role and time_slice. In parallel, retrieve the current user’s system roles and positions (if stored outside these tables) via a who_am_i or equivalent identity service to check for any additional permissions (for example, being a project lead or department leader). Since reading one’s own role on a project is generally allowed and there is no explicit restriction in the provided rules, mark access as allowed if a team_member entry exists for that project; otherwise mark as not a member. Output a list showing, for each candidate project, whether the user is a team member and what the team_member.role value is when present.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_memberships":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"is_member":{"type":"boolean"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","is_member"]}}},"required":["employee_id","project_memberships"]}
  6. Determine and structure the answer about the user’s role on the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" initiative based on the identified project membership and role information, including whether clarification is needed due to ambiguity or missing matches.
     Approach: From Step 5, filter to projects where is_member is true. If exactly one matching project has the highest similarity to the initiative description and the user is a member, extract the role field (for example, "Lead", "Engineer", "Other") as the user’s role for this initiative. If there are multiple plausible projects where the user is a member, or similarity scores are close, mark the situation as ambiguous and prepare to request clarification by listing all such projects and their roles. If no matching projects where the user is a member are found, indicate that no role could be identified. Structure the outcome to clearly state the resolved role, the related project_id (if unique), and whether further clarification from the user is required.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"status":{"type":"string","enum":["role_identified","no_matching_project","ambiguous"]},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"ambiguous_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id"]}}},"required":["status","ambiguous_projects"]}
