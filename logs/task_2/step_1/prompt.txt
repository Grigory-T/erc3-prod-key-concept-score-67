Step 1: Identify the current user "Noemi Coppola" (employee id "6KR2_043") in the employee table to obtain the authoritative internal employee record that will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.
Approach: Query the employee table using an exact match on id = "6KR2_043" as the primary key. If no record is found, perform a secondary **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search using the name "Noemi Coppola" and potential variations (case insensitivity, whitespace normalization, partial matches, and tolerance for minor misspellings) across the name and email fields. Do not proceed to later steps if the employee cannot be uniquely identified.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_record":{"type":["object","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
