I have verified the execution of Step 6. All actions were completed as per the approach:

1. **Filtered projects where is_member is true**: From Step 5, we had exactly one project (`proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover`) where the user is a member with role "Engineer".

2. **Checked for multiple plausible projects**: I verified there are no other Carpathia-related projects in the system (only 1 out of 36 total projects). The user is not a member of any other projects that could cause ambiguity.

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` confirmed current user context
   - `get_project()` verified project details and team membership
   - `list_all_projects()` showed 36 total projects
   - Manual filtering confirmed only one Carpathia-related project
   - No other project memberships found for the user

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The conclusion is correct: exactly one matching project where the user is a member, with role "Engineer". No ambiguity exists.
