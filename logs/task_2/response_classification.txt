## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current user "Noemi Coppola" (employee id "6KR2_043") in the employee table to obtain the authoritative internal employee record that will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.
Approach: Query the employee table using an exact match on id = "6KR2_043" as the primary key. If no record is found, perform a secondary **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search using the name "Noemi Coppola" and potential variations (case insensitivity, whitespace normalization, partial matches, and tolerance for minor misspellings) across the name and email fields. Do not proceed to later steps if the employee cannot be uniquely identified.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_record":{"type":["object","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
**Result:** Successfully identified the current user "Noemi Coppola" with employee ID "6KR2_043" using exact match. The authoritative employee record has been retrieved and will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.

      {"name": "will_travel", "level": 6}
    ]
  }
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check internal wiki and documentation for any mention of the initiative or project described as "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" to understand if this is a codename, formal project name, or process description.
Approach: Search the wiki_file table using the path and content fields for occurrences related to the phrase "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". Use **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search on the content, including breaking the phrase into key components such as "crossover support", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoats", and "Carpathia Metalworks". Account for potential typos and variants (for example, "Carpathian", "Carpatia", "Metal Works"), partial matches, and abbreviation-style references. Extract any referenced project identifiers, customer identifiers, or internal shorthand that clearly relate to this initiative.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matches_found":{"type":"integer"},"related_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customer_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["path"]}}},"required":["matches_found","related_entries"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed, searching the internal wiki and documentation for mentions of the initiative "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". 

I performed:
1. Fuzzy search on the phrase components: ['early-stage crossover support', 'liquid to powder', 'powder topcoats', 'Carpathia Metalworks', 'crossover support', 'Carpathia']
2. Regex search for "Carpathia Metalworks"
3. Analysis of wiki pages with matches to extract potential project and customer IDs

The search returned 120 fuzzy matches across 18 unique wiki pages. Four wiki pages contained patterns that could be project or customer IDs, though these appear to be generic system documentation terms rather than specific identifiers for this initiative. The specific project and customer IDs found in the project and customer databases (proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover and cust_carpathia_metalworks) do not appear in any wiki content.

No state-changing operations were performed; this was a read-only search of the wiki documentation.

{
  "matches_found": 120,
  "related_entries": [
    {
      "path": "systems/project_registry.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/knowledge_base.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT_REGISTRY"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "company/overview.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md",
      "project_ids": [],
      "customer_ids": ["CUSTOMER_PROJECT"]
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks" in the customer table to establish the correct customer_id for the initiative.
Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on name = "Carpathia Metalworks". If no exact match is found, perform a **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search over the name and brief fields to find closely matching candidates (handling lowercase, whitespace normalization, partial string inclusion, and minor misspellings such as "Carpatia", "Carpathian Metalworks"). Use a similarity scoring or fuzzy_compare function and select the top candidates above a reasonable confidence threshold. If multiple candidates satisfy the threshold, list them all for potential ambiguity resolution.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["query_name","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified and completed Step 3 to identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks". 

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: I queried the customer table by listing all 21 customers and checking for an exact match on the name "Carpathia Metalworks". No exact match was found (0 matches).

2. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: 
   - I performed a fuzzy search using `fuzzy_compare` on all customer names, which identified one strong candidate: "Carpathia Metalworkers" with a similarity score of 0.952.
   - To ensure thoroughness, I also checked the brief field of all customers for any mention of "Carpathia" or related terms. I retrieved the full customer record for the candidate to examine its brief field, which confirmed it is indeed the relevant customer.
   - I performed additional searches using components of the name ("Carpathia", "Metalworks") and found no other customers with significant similarity.

3. **No State Changes**: This step only involved read operations (listing, searching, and retrieving customer data). No state-changing operations were performed.

**Result**: The customer "Carpathia Metalworkers" (ID: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`) is the clear match for the initiative. The similarity score of 0.952 indicates a very high confidence match, with only a minor plural difference in the name ("Metalworkers" vs "Metalworks").

All data used in the JSON response comes directly from function returns as printed in the execution.

{
  "query_name": "Carpathia Metalworks",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "name": "Carpathia Metalworkers",
      "similarity_score": 0.952
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing. Collect all projects that plausibly match this initiative, along with a similarity score for traceability of matching quality.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["candidate_projects"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly verified the execution of Step 4. The verification confirms that the approach was correctly followed and the results are accurate based on explicit function returns.

**Verification Summary:**

1. **Customer Confirmation**: Customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks` (Carpathia Metalworkers) from Step 3 is correct and exists in the system.

2. **Project Details Verified**: 
   - Project `proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover` exists with name "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support"
   - Customer ID matches exactly: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - Project description: "Support project to transition selected Carpathia Metalworks lines from liquid to compatible powder topcoats."
   - Project status: "idea"
   - Team includes current user `6KR2_043` (Noemi Coppola) as Engineer with 0.4 time slice

3. **Key Term Matching**: 
   - 5 out of 8 key terms match exactly: "crossover", "powder topcoat", "powder topcoats", "support", "carpathia"
   - "liquid to powder" doesn't match exactly but "liquid-to-powder" (hyphenated) does appear
   - "early-stage" and "early stage" don't appear, but the project is in "idea" phase which aligns with "early-stage"

4. **Similarity Score Calculation Verified**:
   - Exact matches: 5/8 = 0.625
   - Exact score component: 0.625 × 0.7 = 0.438
   - Fuzzy match ratio: 0.493
   - Fuzzy score component: 0.493 × 0.3 = 0.148
   - Total score: 0.438 + 0.148 = 0.585 (rounded)

5. **Broader Search Confirmation**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Only 1 project belongs to customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - No other projects closely match the initiative description
   - Other projects with "topcoat" in name/description are for different customers

**Conclusion**: The execution was complete and accurate. All facts were verified from function returns, no assumptions were made, and no state-changing operations were performed. The single candidate project found strongly matches the initiative description.

{
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
      "name": "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "similarity_score": 0.585
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and team membership of the current user "6KR2_043" for the candidate projects to confirm that she is part of these projects and allowed to view her role.
Approach: For each project_id from Step 4, query the team_member table with exact matching on employee_id = "6KR2_043" and project_id = that project. Retrieve any matching rows and the associated role and time_slice. In parallel, retrieve the current user’s system roles and positions (if stored outside these tables) via a who_am_i or equivalent identity service to check for any additional permissions (for example, being a project lead or department leader). Since reading one’s own role on a project is generally allowed and there is no explicit restriction in the provided rules, mark access as allowed if a team_member entry exists for that project; otherwise mark as not a member. Output a list showing, for each candidate project, whether the user is a team member and what the team_member.role value is when present.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_memberships":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"is_member":{"type":"boolean"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","is_member"]}}},"required":["employee_id","project_memberships"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 5 by executing all required actions. I verified:

1. **Current User Context**: Retrieved via `who_am_i()` - user is authenticated (is_public=False), department: "R&D and Technical Service", location: "HQ – Italy".

2. **Project Team Membership**: For the candidate project "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover", I:
   - Retrieved the full project details via `get_project()`
   - Examined the team list (3 members total)
   - Found current user "6KR2_043" as a team member with:
     - Role: "Engineer"
     - Time slice: 0.4

3. **No System Roles Available**: The `who_am_i()` function does not provide system_roles in the current implementation, but this doesn't affect the team membership verification.

4. **No State Changes**: This step involved only read operations; no state-changing operations were performed.

All facts were verified from function returns as printed in the execution. The user is confirmed to be a team member on the project, which allows viewing her role as requested.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_043",
  "project_memberships": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
      "is_member": true,
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    }
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Determine and structure the answer about the user’s role on the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" initiative based on the identified project membership and role information, including whether clarification is needed due to ambiguity or missing matches.
Approach: From Step 5, filter to projects where is_member is true. If exactly one matching project has the highest similarity to the initiative description and the user is a member, extract the role field (for example, "Lead", "Engineer", "Other") as the user’s role for this initiative. If there are multiple plausible projects where the user is a member, or similarity scores are close, mark the situation as ambiguous and prepare to request clarification by listing all such projects and their roles. If no matching projects where the user is a member are found, indicate that no role could be identified. Structure the outcome to clearly state the resolved role, the related project_id (if unique), and whether further clarification from the user is required.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"status":{"type":"string","enum":["role_identified","no_matching_project","ambiguous"]},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"ambiguous_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id"]}}},"required":["status","ambiguous_projects"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 6. All actions were completed as per the approach:

1. **Filtered projects where is_member is true**: From Step 5, we had exactly one project (`proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover`) where the user is a member with role "Engineer".

2. **Checked for multiple plausible projects**: I verified there are no other Carpathia-related projects in the system (only 1 out of 36 total projects). The user is not a member of any other projects that could cause ambiguity.

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` confirmed current user context
   - `get_project()` verified project details and team membership
   - `list_all_projects()` showed 36 total projects
   - Manual filtering confirmed only one Carpathia-related project
   - No other project memberships found for the user

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The conclusion is correct: exactly one matching project where the user is a member, with role "Engineer". No ambiguity exists.

{
  "status": "role_identified",
  "primary_project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
  "role": "Engineer",
  "ambiguous_projects": []
}

Approach: Search the wiki_file table using the path and content fields for occurrences related to the phrase "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". Use **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search on the content, including breaking the phrase into key components such as "crossover support", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoats", and "Carpathia Metalworks". Account for potential typos and variants (for example, "Carpathian", "Carpatia", "Metal Works"), partial matches, and abbreviation-style references. Extract any referenced project identifiers, customer identifiers, or internal shorthand that clearly relate to this initiative.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matches_found":{"type":"integer"},"related_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customer_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["path"]}}},"required":["matches_found","related_entries"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed, searching the internal wiki and documentation for mentions of the initiative "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". 

I performed:
1. Fuzzy search on the phrase components: ['early-stage crossover support', 'liquid to powder', 'powder topcoats', 'Carpathia Metalworks', 'crossover support', 'Carpathia']
2. Regex search for "Carpathia Metalworks"
3. Analysis of wiki pages with matches to extract potential project and customer IDs

The search returned 120 fuzzy matches across 18 unique wiki pages. Four wiki pages contained patterns that could be project or customer IDs, though these appear to be generic system documentation terms rather than specific identifiers for this initiative. The specific project and customer IDs found in the project and customer databases (proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover and cust_carpathia_metalworks) do not appear in any wiki content.

No state-changing operations were performed; this was a read-only search of the wiki documentation.

{
  "matches_found": 120,
  "related_entries": [
    {
      "path": "systems/project_registry.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/knowledge_base.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT_REGISTRY"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "company/overview.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md",
      "project_ids": [],
      "customer_ids": ["CUSTOMER_PROJECT"]
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks" in the customer table to establish the correct customer_id for the initiative.
Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on name = "Carpathia Metalworks". If no exact match is found, perform a **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search over the name and brief fields to find closely matching candidates (handling lowercase, whitespace normalization, partial string inclusion, and minor misspellings such as "Carpatia", "Carpathian Metalworks"). Use a similarity scoring or fuzzy_compare function and select the top candidates above a reasonable confidence threshold. If multiple candidates satisfy the threshold, list them all for potential ambiguity resolution.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["query_name","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified and completed Step 3 to identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks". 

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: I queried the customer table by listing all 21 customers and checking for an exact match on the name "Carpathia Metalworks". No exact match was found (0 matches).

2. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: 
   - I performed a fuzzy search using `fuzzy_compare` on all customer names, which identified one strong candidate: "Carpathia Metalworkers" with a similarity score of 0.952.
   - To ensure thoroughness, I also checked the brief field of all customers for any mention of "Carpathia" or related terms. I retrieved the full customer record for the candidate to examine its brief field, which confirmed it is indeed the relevant customer.
   - I performed additional searches using components of the name ("Carpathia", "Metalworks") and found no other customers with significant similarity.

3. **No State Changes**: This step only involved read operations (listing, searching, and retrieving customer data). No state-changing operations were performed.

**Result**: The customer "Carpathia Metalworkers" (ID: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`) is the clear match for the initiative. The similarity score of 0.952 indicates a very high confidence match, with only a minor plural difference in the name ("Metalworkers" vs "Metalworks").

All data used in the JSON response comes directly from function returns as printed in the execution.

{
  "query_name": "Carpathia Metalworks",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "name": "Carpathia Metalworkers",
      "similarity_score": 0.952
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing. Collect all projects that plausibly match this initiative, along with a similarity score for traceability of matching quality.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["candidate_projects"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly verified the execution of Step 4. The verification confirms that the approach was correctly followed and the results are accurate based on explicit function returns.

**Verification Summary:**

1. **Customer Confirmation**: Customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks` (Carpathia Metalworkers) from Step 3 is correct and exists in the system.

2. **Project Details Verified**: 
   - Project `proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover` exists with name "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support"
   - Customer ID matches exactly: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - Project description: "Support project to transition selected Carpathia Metalworks lines from liquid to compatible powder topcoats."
   - Project status: "idea"
   - Team includes current user `6KR2_043` (Noemi Coppola) as Engineer with 0.4 time slice

3. **Key Term Matching**: 
   - 5 out of 8 key terms match exactly: "crossover", "powder topcoat", "powder topcoats", "support", "carpathia"
   - "liquid to powder" doesn't match exactly but "liquid-to-powder" (hyphenated) does appear
   - "early-stage" and "early stage" don't appear, but the project is in "idea" phase which aligns with "early-stage"

4. **Similarity Score Calculation Verified**:
   - Exact matches: 5/8 = 0.625
   - Exact score component: 0.625 × 0.7 = 0.438
   - Fuzzy match ratio: 0.493
   - Fuzzy score component: 0.493 × 0.3 = 0.148
   - Total score: 0.438 + 0.148 = 0.585 (rounded)

5. **Broader Search Confirmation**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Only 1 project belongs to customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - No other projects closely match the initiative description
   - Other projects with "topcoat" in name/description are for different customers

**Conclusion**: The execution was complete and accurate. All facts were verified from function returns, no assumptions were made, and no state-changing operations were performed. The single candidate project found strongly matches the initiative description.

{
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
      "name": "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support",
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "similarity_score": 0.585
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and team membership of the current user "6KR2_043" for the candidate projects to confirm that she is part of these projects and allowed to view her role.
Approach: For each project_id from Step 4, query the team_member table with exact matching on employee_id = "6KR2_043" and project_id = that project. Retrieve any matching rows and the associated role and time_slice. In parallel, retrieve the current user’s system roles and positions (if stored outside these tables) via a who_am_i or equivalent identity service to check for any additional permissions (for example, being a project lead or department leader). Since reading one’s own role on a project is generally allowed and there is no explicit restriction in the provided rules, mark access as allowed if a team_member entry exists for that project; otherwise mark as not a member. Output a list showing, for each candidate project, whether the user is a team member and what the team_member.role value is when present.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_memberships":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"is_member":{"type":"boolean"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]}},"required":["project_id","is_member"]}}},"required":["employee_id","project_memberships"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 5 by executing all required actions. I verified:

1. **Current User Context**: Retrieved via `who_am_i()` - user is authenticated (is_public=False), department: "R&D and Technical Service", location: "HQ – Italy".

2. **Project Team Membership**: For the candidate project "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover", I:
   - Retrieved the full project details via `get_project()`
   - Examined the team list (3 members total)
   - Found current user "6KR2_043" as a team member with:
     - Role: "Engineer"
     - Time slice: 0.4

3. **No System Roles Available**: The `who_am_i()` function does not provide system_roles in the current implementation, but this doesn't affect the team membership verification.

4. **No State Changes**: This step involved only read operations; no state-changing operations were performed.

All facts were verified from function returns as printed in the execution. The user is confirmed to be a team member on the project, which allows viewing her role as requested.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_043",
  "project_memberships": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
      "is_member": true,
      "role": "Engineer",
      "time_slice": 0.4
    }
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Determine and structure the answer about the user’s role on the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" initiative based on the identified project membership and role information, including whether clarification is needed due to ambiguity or missing matches.
Approach: From Step 5, filter to projects where is_member is true. If exactly one matching project has the highest similarity to the initiative description and the user is a member, extract the role field (for example, "Lead", "Engineer", "Other") as the user’s role for this initiative. If there are multiple plausible projects where the user is a member, or similarity scores are close, mark the situation as ambiguous and prepare to request clarification by listing all such projects and their roles. If no matching projects where the user is a member are found, indicate that no role could be identified. Structure the outcome to clearly state the resolved role, the related project_id (if unique), and whether further clarification from the user is required.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"status":{"type":"string","enum":["role_identified","no_matching_project","ambiguous"]},"primary_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"role":{"type":["string","null"]},"ambiguous_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id"]}}},"required":["status","ambiguous_projects"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 6. All actions were completed as per the approach:

1. **Filtered projects where is_member is true**: From Step 5, we had exactly one project (`proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover`) where the user is a member with role "Engineer".

2. **Checked for multiple plausible projects**: I verified there are no other Carpathia-related projects in the system (only 1 out of 36 total projects). The user is not a member of any other projects that could cause ambiguity.

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` confirmed current user context
   - `get_project()` verified project details and team membership
   - `list_all_projects()` showed 36 total projects
   - Manual filtering confirmed only one Carpathia-related project
   - No other project memberships found for the user

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The conclusion is correct: exactly one matching project where the user is a member, with role "Engineer". No ambiguity exists.

{
  "status": "role_identified",
  "primary_project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
  "role": "Engineer",
  "ambiguous_projects": []
}

### Final Result
Your role on the 'early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks' initiative is Engineer (project: proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover). You are confirmed as a team member on this project, and there are no ambiguous or alternative matches.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected

- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links
