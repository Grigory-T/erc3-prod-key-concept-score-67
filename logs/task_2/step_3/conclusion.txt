I have verified and completed Step 3 to identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks". 

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: I queried the customer table by listing all 21 customers and checking for an exact match on the name "Carpathia Metalworks". No exact match was found (0 matches).

2. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: 
   - I performed a fuzzy search using `fuzzy_compare` on all customer names, which identified one strong candidate: "Carpathia Metalworkers" with a similarity score of 0.952.
   - To ensure thoroughness, I also checked the brief field of all customers for any mention of "Carpathia" or related terms. I retrieved the full customer record for the candidate to examine its brief field, which confirmed it is indeed the relevant customer.
   - I performed additional searches using components of the name ("Carpathia", "Metalworks") and found no other customers with significant similarity.

3. **No State Changes**: This step only involved read operations (listing, searching, and retrieving customer data). No state-changing operations were performed.

**Result**: The customer "Carpathia Metalworkers" (ID: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`) is the clear match for the initiative. The similarity score of 0.952 indicates a very high confidence match, with only a minor plural difference in the name ("Metalworkers" vs "Metalworks").

All data used in the JSON response comes directly from function returns as printed in the execution.
