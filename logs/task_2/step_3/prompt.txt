Step 3: Identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks" in the customer table to establish the correct customer_id for the initiative.
Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on name = "Carpathia Metalworks". If no exact match is found, perform a **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search over the name and brief fields to find closely matching candidates (handling lowercase, whitespace normalization, partial string inclusion, and minor misspellings such as "Carpatia", "Carpathian Metalworks"). Use a similarity scoring or fuzzy_compare function and select the top candidates above a reasonable confidence threshold. If multiple candidates satisfy the threshold, list them all for potential ambiguity resolution.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["query_name","candidates"]}
