Step 4: Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing. Collect all projects that plausibly match this initiative, along with a similarity score for traceability of matching quality.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["candidate_projects"]}
