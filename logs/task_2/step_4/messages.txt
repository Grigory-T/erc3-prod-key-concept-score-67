## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-10-23
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_043
User details: {"id": "6KR2_043", "name": "Noemi Coppola", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: 6KR2_043
department: R&D and Technical Service
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-10-23
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** What is my role on early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current user "Noemi Coppola" (employee id "6KR2_043") in the employee table to obtain the authoritative internal employee record that will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.
Approach: Query the employee table using an exact match on id = "6KR2_043" as the primary key. If no record is found, perform a secondary **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search using the name "Noemi Coppola" and potential variations (case insensitivity, whitespace normalization, partial matches, and tolerance for minor misspellings) across the name and email fields. Do not proceed to later steps if the employee cannot be uniquely identified.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_record":{"type":["object","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
**Result:** Successfully identified the current user "Noemi Coppola" with employee ID "6KR2_043" using exact match. The authoritative employee record has been retrieved and will be used for subsequent permission checks and team membership lookups.

{
  "employee_id": "6KR2_043",
  "found": true,
  "employee_record": {
    "id": "6KR2_043",
    "name": "Noemi Coppola",
    "email": "6KR2_043@bellini.internal",
    "location": "HQ – Italy",
    "department": "R&D and Technical Service",
    "skills": [
      {"name": "skill_corrosion", "level": 6},
      {"name": "skill_crm", "level": 3},
      {"name": "skill_crm_systems", "level": 6},
      {"name": "skill_english", "level": 7},
      {"name": "skill_german", "level": 3},
      {"name": "skill_italian", "level": 3},
      {"name": "skill_negotiation", "level": 5},
      {"name": "skill_production_planning", "level": 6},
      {"name": "skill_progress_admin", "level": 5},

      {"name": "skill_rail", "level": 3},
      {"name": "skill_solventborne", "level": 6},
      {"name": "skill_technical_coatings", "level": 3},
      {"name": "skill_waterborne", "level": 5}
    ],
    "wills": [
      {"name": "will_cross_site", "level": 4},
      {"name": "will_digitalisation", "level": 5},
      {"name": "will_mentor_juniors", "level": 3},
      {"name": "will_people_management", "level": 3},
      {"name": "will_process_improvement", "level": 5},
      {"name": "will_travel", "level": 6}
    ]
  }
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check internal wiki and documentation for any mention of the initiative or project described as "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks" to understand if this is a codename, formal project name, or process description.
Approach: Search the wiki_file table using the path and content fields for occurrences related to the phrase "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". Use **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search on the content, including breaking the phrase into key components such as "crossover support", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoats", and "Carpathia Metalworks". Account for potential typos and variants (for example, "Carpathian", "Carpatia", "Metal Works"), partial matches, and abbreviation-style references. Extract any referenced project identifiers, customer identifiers, or internal shorthand that clearly relate to this initiative.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matches_found":{"type":"integer"},"related_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customer_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["path"]}}},"required":["matches_found","related_entries"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 as instructed, searching the internal wiki and documentation for mentions of the initiative "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". 

I performed:
1. Fuzzy search on the phrase components: ['early-stage crossover support', 'liquid to powder', 'powder topcoats', 'Carpathia Metalworks', 'crossover support', 'Carpathia']
2. Regex search for "Carpathia Metalworks"
3. Analysis of wiki pages with matches to extract potential project and customer IDs

The search returned 120 fuzzy matches across 18 unique wiki pages. Four wiki pages contained patterns that could be project or customer IDs, though these appear to be generic system documentation terms rather than specific identifiers for this initiative. The specific project and customer IDs found in the project and customer databases (proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover and cust_carpathia_metalworks) do not appear in any wiki content.

No state-changing operations were performed; this was a read-only search of the wiki documentation.

{
  "matches_found": 120,
  "related_entries": [
    {
      "path": "systems/project_registry.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/knowledge_base.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT_REGISTRY"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "company/overview.md",
      "project_ids": ["PROJECT-CENTRIC"],
      "customer_ids": []
    },
    {
      "path": "systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md",
      "project_ids": [],
      "customer_ids": ["CUSTOMER_PROJECT"]
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks" in the customer table to establish the correct customer_id for the initiative.
Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on name = "Carpathia Metalworks". If no exact match is found, perform a **fuzzy and semantic / logical** search over the name and brief fields to find closely matching candidates (handling lowercase, whitespace normalization, partial string inclusion, and minor misspellings such as "Carpatia", "Carpathian Metalworks"). Use a similarity scoring or fuzzy_compare function and select the top candidates above a reasonable confidence threshold. If multiple candidates satisfy the threshold, list them all for potential ambiguity resolution.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["query_name","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified and completed Step 3 to identify the customer record corresponding to "Carpathia Metalworks". 

**Verification of Execution:**

1. **Exact Match Attempt**: I queried the customer table by listing all 21 customers and checking for an exact match on the name "Carpathia Metalworks". No exact match was found (0 matches).

2. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: 
   - I performed a fuzzy search using `fuzzy_compare` on all customer names, which identified one strong candidate: "Carpathia Metalworkers" with a similarity score of 0.952.
   - To ensure thoroughness, I also checked the brief field of all customers for any mention of "Carpathia" or related terms. I retrieved the full customer record for the candidate to examine its brief field, which confirmed it is indeed the relevant customer.
   - I performed additional searches using components of the name ("Carpathia", "Metalworks") and found no other customers with significant similarity.

3. **No State Changes**: This step only involved read operations (listing, searching, and retrieving customer data). No state-changing operations were performed.

**Result**: The customer "Carpathia Metalworkers" (ID: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`) is the clear match for the initiative. The similarity score of 0.952 indicates a very high confidence match, with only a minor plural difference in the name ("Metalworkers" vs "Metalworks").

All data used in the JSON response comes directly from function returns as printed in the execution.

{
  "query_name": "Carpathia Metalworks",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "name": "Carpathia Metalworkers",
      "similarity_score": 0.952
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 4 to find specific projects corresponding to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for Carpathia Metalworks.

**Execution Summary:**

1. **Target Customer**: Used customer ID `cust_carpathia_metalworks` identified in Step 3.

2. **Search Approach**: 
   - First searched for all projects belonging to the Carpathia Metalworks customer
   - Found 1 project associated with this customer
   - Analyzed the project name and description against key terms from the initiative
   - Calculated similarity scores based on exact term matches and fuzzy matching

3. **Results**: Found exactly 1 candidate project that strongly matches the initiative description.

**Key Findings:**
- **Project ID**: `proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover`
- **Project Name**: "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support"
- **Customer ID**: `cust_carpathia_metalworks` (Carpathia Metalworkers)
- **Similarity Score**: 0.585

**Match Analysis:**
The project name contains multiple key terms from the initiative: "crossover", "powder topcoat", and "support". The customer match is exact. The similarity score of 0.585 indicates a strong match to the initiative description.

No state-changing operations were performed; this step involved only read operations to search and analyze projects.

The search was comprehensive, first focusing on the customer's projects, then broadening to all projects if necessary. Only one highly relevant project was found, which aligns perfectly with the initiative description.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Find the specific project or projects in the project table that correspond to the "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats" initiative for the identified Carpathia Metalworks customer (or best candidate customers).
Approach: Using the customer_id or candidate customer_ids from Step 3 and any project_ids or hints extracted in Step 2, query the project table. First, search for projects where customer_id matches the Carpathia Metalworks customer_id and where the project name or description contains the key terms "crossover", "liquid to powder", "powder topcoat", or similar. If no such projects are found, broaden the search with **fuzzy and semantic / logical** matching on project name and description across all projects (not only those with the inferred customer), accounting for typos, partial matches, and rearranged phrasing. Collect all projects that plausibly match this initiative, along with a similarity score for traceability of matching quality.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["candidate_projects"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have thoroughly verified the execution of Step 4. The verification confirms that the approach was correctly followed and the results are accurate based on explicit function returns.

**Verification Summary:**

1. **Customer Confirmation**: Customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks` (Carpathia Metalworkers) from Step 3 is correct and exists in the system.

2. **Project Details Verified**: 
   - Project `proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover` exists with name "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support"
   - Customer ID matches exactly: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - Project description: "Support project to transition selected Carpathia Metalworks lines from liquid to compatible powder topcoats."
   - Project status: "idea"
   - Team includes current user `6KR2_043` (Noemi Coppola) as Engineer with 0.4 time slice

3. **Key Term Matching**: 
   - 5 out of 8 key terms match exactly: "crossover", "powder topcoat", "powder topcoats", "support", "carpathia"
   - "liquid to powder" doesn't match exactly but "liquid-to-powder" (hyphenated) does appear
   - "early-stage" and "early stage" don't appear, but the project is in "idea" phase which aligns with "early-stage"

4. **Similarity Score Calculation Verified**:
   - Exact matches: 5/8 = 0.625
   - Exact score component: 0.625 × 0.7 = 0.438
   - Fuzzy match ratio: 0.493
   - Fuzzy score component: 0.493 × 0.3 = 0.148
   - Total score: 0.438 + 0.148 = 0.585 (rounded)

5. **Broader Search Confirmation**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Only 1 project belongs to customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - No other projects closely match the initiative description
   - Other projects with "topcoat" in name/description are for different customers

**Conclusion**: The execution was complete and accurate. All facts were verified from function returns, no assumptions were made, and no state-changing operations were performed. The single candidate project found strongly matches the initiative description.
