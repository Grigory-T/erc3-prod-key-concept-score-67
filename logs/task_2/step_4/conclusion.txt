I have thoroughly verified the execution of Step 4. The verification confirms that the approach was correctly followed and the results are accurate based on explicit function returns.

**Verification Summary:**

1. **Customer Confirmation**: Customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks` (Carpathia Metalworkers) from Step 3 is correct and exists in the system.

2. **Project Details Verified**: 
   - Project `proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover` exists with name "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support"
   - Customer ID matches exactly: `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - Project description: "Support project to transition selected Carpathia Metalworks lines from liquid to compatible powder topcoats."
   - Project status: "idea"
   - Team includes current user `6KR2_043` (Noemi Coppola) as Engineer with 0.4 time slice

3. **Key Term Matching**: 
   - 5 out of 8 key terms match exactly: "crossover", "powder topcoat", "powder topcoats", "support", "carpathia"
   - "liquid to powder" doesn't match exactly but "liquid-to-powder" (hyphenated) does appear
   - "early-stage" and "early stage" don't appear, but the project is in "idea" phase which aligns with "early-stage"

4. **Similarity Score Calculation Verified**:
   - Exact matches: 5/8 = 0.625
   - Exact score component: 0.625 × 0.7 = 0.438
   - Fuzzy match ratio: 0.493
   - Fuzzy score component: 0.493 × 0.3 = 0.148
   - Total score: 0.438 + 0.148 = 0.585 (rounded)

5. **Broader Search Confirmation**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Only 1 project belongs to customer `cust_carpathia_metalworks`
   - No other projects closely match the initiative description
   - Other projects with "topcoat" in name/description are for different customers

**Conclusion**: The execution was complete and accurate. All facts were verified from function returns, no assumptions were made, and no state-changing operations were performed. The single candidate project found strongly matches the initiative description.
