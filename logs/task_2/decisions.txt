DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 18:59:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 completed as planned with a successful and unambiguous identification of the current user. There are no unexpected results, missing information, or inconsistencies. The next logical step according to the original plan is to proceed to step 2, searching for relevant documentation and identifiers about the initiative. The plan remains fully valid and executable.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:05:52
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The executed steps (1 and 2) have been completed according to the original plan, and the results are coherent: the user was correctly identified and the wiki/documentation search did not find specific project/customer IDs for the initiative, but this does not constitute a blocking condition for proceeding. The remaining steps are directly actionable and the plan is still valid: proceed to find the customer record and continue as planned. There is no indication of a problem or need to replan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:08:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 3) produced the expected result strictly according to the original plan: the customer for 'Carpathia Metalworks' was identified with high confidence. There were no unexpected issues or missing information, and the next planned step (Step 4) remains fully executable. No company rules or plan requirements were violated or unmet. According to the decision rules, the process should continue with the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:14:19
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced expected, relevant, and correct results strictly following the original plan. The current progress matches the original plan's steps: the employee was identified, the wiki/documentation was searched, the correct customer and candidate project were found with strong evidence. There are no inconsistencies or unexpected results. The next step—checking project membership and retrieving the user's role—is necessary and should proceed as planned. There is no justification to abort or replan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:16:38
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All prior steps produced results exactly matching the original plan without errors or unexpected discrepancies. Step 6 is all that remains and has clear, unambiguous input: the user is confirmed to be a team member on the single project that matches the initiative, with the role 'Engineer'. There are no ambiguities or missing information, so the plan is still valid and can proceed directly to producing the structured answer as expected. No replanning or abort is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:18:09
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been executed fully, and all expected results were returned correctly and unambiguously. The user's role for the identified initiative has been definitively established. No further steps remain and the answer is complete and factual.
