I have executed Step 2 as instructed, searching the internal wiki and documentation for mentions of the initiative "early-stage crossover support from liquid to powder topcoats for Carpathia Metalworks". 

I performed:
1. Fuzzy search on the phrase components: ['early-stage crossover support', 'liquid to powder', 'powder topcoats', 'Carpathia Metalworks', 'crossover support', 'Carpathia']
2. Regex search for "Carpathia Metalworks"
3. Analysis of wiki pages with matches to extract potential project and customer IDs

The search returned 120 fuzzy matches across 18 unique wiki pages. Four wiki pages contained patterns that could be project or customer IDs, though these appear to be generic system documentation terms rather than specific identifiers for this initiative. The specific project and customer IDs found in the project and customer databases (proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover and cust_carpathia_metalworks) do not appear in any wiki content.

No state-changing operations were performed; this was a read-only search of the wiki documentation.
