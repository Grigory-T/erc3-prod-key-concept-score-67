STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 19:16:35

I have completed Step 5 by executing all required actions. I verified:

1. **Current User Context**: Retrieved via `who_am_i()` - user is authenticated (is_public=False), department: "R&D and Technical Service", location: "HQ – Italy".

2. **Project Team Membership**: For the candidate project "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover", I:
   - Retrieved the full project details via `get_project()`
   - Examined the team list (3 members total)
   - Found current user "6KR2_043" as a team member with:
     - Role: "Engineer"
     - Time slice: 0.4

3. **No System Roles Available**: The `who_am_i()` function does not provide system_roles in the current implementation, but this doesn't affect the team membership verification.

4. **No State Changes**: This step involved only read operations; no state-changing operations were performed.

All facts were verified from function returns as printed in the execution. The user is confirmed to be a team member on the project, which allows viewing her role as requested.
