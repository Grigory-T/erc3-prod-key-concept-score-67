I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the wiki and project system to identify and disambiguate "coating project". The analysis included:

1. **Exact phrase search**: No matches for "coating project" in wiki content or project names.
2. **Partial matching**: Found numerous references to "coating"/"coatings" throughout wiki files describing the company's core business.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy search for variations including potential misspellings, with high relevance scores (1.0) across key business and company documentation.
4. **Semantic/logical association**: Examined related terminology like "coating system", "coating initiative", "coating program" in both wiki and actual projects.
5. **Project system analysis**: Found 10 active/exploring projects containing "coating" in their names (e.g., "High-temperature coating for presses", "Warehouse floor coating system"), but no single project uniquely identified as "the coating project".
6. **Context analysis**: Reviewed project registry documentation which describes coating projects as examples but doesn't define a specific "coating project" alias.

Conclusion: The term "coating project" is ambiguous within Bellini Coatings' context. The company has multiple coating-related projects, but no single project is commonly referred to as "the coating project". Additional clarification is needed to determine which specific project is being referenced.

No state was changed during this investigation - all operations were read-only.
