Step 1: Identify and disambiguate what "coating project" refers to by searching internal documentation (wiki) for any references, aliases, or explanations.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table and any available full-text or helper utilities (including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) to search for the exact phrase "coating project" first, then relax to partial matches such as "coating", "coatings", "coated" in both path and content. Apply fuzzy matching to account for possible misspellings (for example, "coarting", "cotting") and use semantic / logical association to capture related terminology (for example, "paint coatings", "industrial coating initiative"). From the matches, infer whether there is a clearly defined internal project commonly referred to as the "coating project" and determine if additional clarification is needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}},"best_interpretation":{"type":["string","null"]},"disambiguation_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","wiki_matches","best_interpretation","disambiguation_needed"]}
