Step 2: Locate the specific project record(s) corresponding to the "coating project" in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using the term "coating project" as the primary reference. First, attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, relax the search by checking whether the lowercase string "coating" (and variants like "coatings") is contained in the lowercase project.name or project.id. If still ambiguous or not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search and fuzzy string comparison to match potential misspellings or semantically related project names (for example, "industrial coating development", "coating optimization"). If multiple candidate projects are found, mark that clarification is needed instead of auto-selecting one; if exactly one high-confidence match is found, record its project_id as the selected project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"clarification_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_search_term","candidate_projects","selected_project_id","clarification_needed"]}
