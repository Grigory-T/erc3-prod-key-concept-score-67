## Execution Summary (abort)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify and disambiguate what "coating project" refers to by searching internal documentation (wiki) for any references, aliases, or explanations.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table and any available full-text or helper utilities (including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) to search for the exact phrase "coating project" first, then relax to partial matches such as "coating", "coatings", "coated" in both path and content. Apply fuzzy matching to account for possible misspellings (for example, "coarting", "cotting") and use semantic / logical association to capture related terminology (for example, "paint coatings", "industrial coating initiative"). From the matches, infer whether there is a clearly defined internal project commonly referred to as the "coating project" and determine if additional clarification is needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}},"best_interpretation":{"type":["string","null"]},"disambiguation_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","wiki_matches","best_interpretation","disambiguation_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the wiki and project system to identify and disambiguate "coating project". The analysis included:

1. **Exact phrase search**: No matches for "coating project" in wiki content or project names.
2. **Partial matching**: Found numerous references to "coating"/"coatings" throughout wiki files describing the company's core business.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy search for variations including potential misspellings, with high relevance scores (1.0) across key business and company documentation.
4. **Semantic/logical association**: Examined related terminology like "coating system", "coating initiative", "coating program" in both wiki and actual projects.
5. **Project system analysis**: Found 10 active/exploring projects containing "coating" in their names (e.g., "High-temperature coating for presses", "Warehouse floor coating system"), but no single project uniquely identified as "the coating project".
6. **Context analysis**: Reviewed project registry documentation which describes coating projects as examples but doesn't define a specific "coating project" alias.

Conclusion: The term "coating project" is ambiguous within Bellini Coatings' context. The company has multiple coating-related projects, but no single project is commonly referred to as "the coating project". Additional clarification is needed to determine which specific project is being referenced.

No state was changed during this investigation - all operations were read-only.

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the specific project record(s) corresponding to the "coating project" in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using the term "coating project" as the primary reference. First, attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, relax the search by checking whether the lowercase string "coating" (and variants like "coatings") is contained in the lowercase project.name or project.id. If still ambiguous or not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search and fuzzy string comparison to match potential misspellings or semantically related project names (for example, "industrial coating development", "coating optimization"). If multiple candidate projects are found, mark that clarification is needed instead of auto-selecting one; if exactly one high-confidence match is found, record its project_id as the selected project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"clarification_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_search_term","candidate_projects","selected_project_id","clarification_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 following all specified approaches:

1. **Exact match search**: Searched for projects with exact name or ID "coating project" - found 0 matches.

2. **Substring search**: Relaxed to search for "coating" and variants ("coatings", "coated") in lowercase project names and IDs - found 10 projects.

3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy string comparison for potential misspellings ("coarting", "cotting", etc.) - found 0 additional good matches with ratio > 0.6.

4. **Semantic/logical search**: Searched for related terminology ("paint", "surface", "finish", "protective", "coating system", etc.) in project names and descriptions - found 7 additional projects not containing "coating" in name/ID but semantically related.

5. **Combined analysis**: Total of 17 unique candidate projects identified through substring and semantic matching.

6. **High-confidence pattern check**: Found 3 projects with patterns like "coating system" in their names, but not enough to uniquely identify "the coating project" among 17 candidates.

**Key Findings:**
- 17 candidate projects identified as potentially related to "coating project"
- No single project uniquely stands out as "the coating project"
- Multiple high-relevance patterns exist across different projects

**Conclusion:** Clarification is needed to determine which specific coating-related project the user is referring to from among the 17 candidates.

### Final Result
Task aborted: The task cannot be completed because it is ambiguous which specific project is referred to as the 'coating project.' Multiple candidate projects (17) were found, and no single project uniquely matches the request. Clarification from the requester is needed before the workload distribution can be determined.
