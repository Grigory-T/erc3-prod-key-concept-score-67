## Execution Summary (abort)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify and disambiguate what "coating project" refers to by searching internal documentation (wiki) for any references, aliases, or explanations.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table and any available full-text or helper utilities (including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) to search for the exact phrase "coating project" first, then relax to partial matches such as "coating", "coatings", "coated" in both path and content. Apply fuzzy matching to account for possible misspellings (for example, "coarting", "cotting") and use semantic / logical association to capture related terminology (for example, "paint coatings", "industrial coating initiative"). From the matches, infer whether there is a clearly defined internal project commonly referred to as the "coating project" and determine if additional clarification is needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}},"best_interpretation":{"type":["string","null"]},"disambiguation_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","wiki_matches","best_interpretation","disambiguation_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the wiki and project system to identify and disambiguate "coating project". The analysis included:

1. **Exact phrase search**: No matches for "coating project" in wiki content or project names.
2. **Partial matching**: Found numerous references to "coating"/"coatings" throughout wiki files describing the company's core business.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy search for variations including potential misspellings, with high relevance scores (1.0) across key business and company documentation.
4. **Semantic/logical association**: Examined related terminology like "coating system", "coating initiative", "coating program" in both wiki and actual projects.
5. **Project system analysis**: Found 10 active/exploring projects containing "coating" in their names (e.g., "High-temperature coating for presses", "Warehouse floor coating system"), but no single project uniquely identified as "the coating project".
6. **Context analysis**: Reviewed project registry documentation which describes coating projects as examples but doesn't define a specific "coating project" alias.

Conclusion: The term "coating project" is ambiguous within Bellini Coatings' context. The company has multiple coating-related projects, but no single project is commonly referred to as "the coating project". Additional clarification is needed to determine which specific project is being referenced.

No state was changed during this investigation - all operations were read-only.

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the specific project record(s) corresponding to the "coating project" in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using the term "coating project" as the primary reference. First, attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, relax the search by checking whether the lowercase string "coating" (and variants like "coatings") is contained in the lowercase project.name or project.id. If still ambiguous or not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search and fuzzy string comparison to match potential misspellings or semantically related project names (for example, "industrial coating development", "coating optimization"). If multiple candidate projects are found, mark that clarification is needed instead of auto-selecting one; if exactly one high-confidence match is found, record its project_id as the selected project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"clarification_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_search_term","candidate_projects","selected_project_id","clarification_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 following all specified approaches:

1. **Exact match search**: Searched for projects with exact name or ID "coating project" - found 0 matches.

2. **Substring search**: Relaxed to search for "coating" and variants ("coatings", "coated") in lowercase project names and IDs - found 10 projects.

3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy string comparison for potential misspellings ("coarting", "cotting", etc.) - found 0 additional good matches with ratio > 0.6.

4. **Semantic/logical search**: Searched for related terminology ("paint", "surface", "finish", "protective", "coating system", etc.) in project names and descriptions - found 7 additional projects not containing "coating" in name/ID but semantically related.

5. **Combined analysis**: Total of 17 unique candidate projects identified through substring and semantic matching.

6. **High-confidence pattern check**: Found 3 projects with patterns like "coating system" in their names, but not enough to uniquely identify "the coating project" among 17 candidates.

**Key Findings:**
- 17 candidate projects identified as potentially related to "coating project"
- No single project uniquely stands out as "the coating project"
- Multiple high-relevance patterns exist across different projects

**Conclusion:** Clarification is needed to determine which specific coating-related project the user is referring to from among the 17 candidates.

No state was changed during this step - all operations were read-only searches.

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify and disambiguate what "coating project" refers to by searching internal documentation (wiki) for any references, aliases, or explanations.
Approach: Use the wiki_file table and any available full-text or helper utilities (including FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search) to search for the exact phrase "coating project" first, then relax to partial matches such as "coating", "coatings", "coated" in both path and content. Apply fuzzy matching to account for possible misspellings (for example, "coarting", "cotting") and use semantic / logical association to capture related terminology (for example, "paint coatings", "industrial coating initiative"). From the matches, infer whether there is a clearly defined internal project commonly referred to as the "coating project" and determine if additional clarification is needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"search_term":{"type":"string"},"wiki_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"snippet":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","relevance_score"]}},"best_interpretation":{"type":["string","null"]},"disambiguation_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["search_term","wiki_matches","best_interpretation","disambiguation_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the wiki and project system to identify and disambiguate "coating project". The analysis included:

1. **Exact phrase search**: No matches for "coating project" in wiki content or project names.
2. **Partial matching**: Found numerous references to "coating"/"coatings" throughout wiki files describing the company's core business.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy search for variations including potential misspellings, with high relevance scores (1.0) across key business and company documentation.
4. **Semantic/logical association**: Examined related terminology like "coating system", "coating initiative", "coating program" in both wiki and actual projects.
5. **Project system analysis**: Found 10 active/exploring projects containing "coating" in their names (e.g., "High-temperature coating for presses", "Warehouse floor coating system"), but no single project uniquely identified as "the coating project".
6. **Context analysis**: Reviewed project registry documentation which describes coating projects as examples but doesn't define a specific "coating project" alias.

Conclusion: The term "coating project" is ambiguous within Bellini Coatings' context. The company has multiple coating-related projects, but no single project is commonly referred to as "the coating project". Additional clarification is needed to determine which specific project is being referenced.

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the specific project record(s) corresponding to the "coating project" in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table using the term "coating project" as the primary reference. First, attempt an exact match on project.name and project.id. If no exact match is found, relax the search by checking whether the lowercase string "coating" (and variants like "coatings") is contained in the lowercase project.name or project.id. If still ambiguous or not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search and fuzzy string comparison to match potential misspellings or semantically related project names (for example, "industrial coating development", "coating optimization"). If multiple candidate projects are found, mark that clarification is needed instead of auto-selecting one; if exactly one high-confidence match is found, record its project_id as the selected project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_search_term":{"type":"string"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"clarification_needed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_search_term","candidate_projects","selected_project_id","clarification_needed"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 following all specified approaches:

1. **Exact match search**: Searched for projects with exact name or ID "coating project" - found 0 matches.

2. **Substring search**: Relaxed to search for "coating" and variants ("coatings", "coated") in lowercase project names and IDs - found 10 projects.

3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy string comparison for potential misspellings ("coarting", "cotting", etc.) - found 0 additional good matches with ratio > 0.6.

4. **Semantic/logical search**: Searched for related terminology ("paint", "surface", "finish", "protective", "coating system", etc.) in project names and descriptions - found 7 additional projects not containing "coating" in name/ID but semantically related.

5. **Combined analysis**: Total of 17 unique candidate projects identified through substring and semantic matching.

6. **High-confidence pattern check**: Found 3 projects with patterns like "coating system" in their names, but not enough to uniquely identify "the coating project" among 17 candidates.

**Key Findings:**
- 17 candidate projects identified as potentially related to "coating project"
- No single project uniquely stands out as "the coating project"
- Multiple high-relevance patterns exist across different projects

**Conclusion:** Clarification is needed to determine which specific coating-related project the user is referring to from among the 17 candidates.

No state was changed during this step - all operations were read-only searches.

### Final Result
Task aborted: The task cannot be completed because it is ambiguous which specific project is referred to as the 'coating project.' Multiple candidate projects (17) were found, and no single project uniquely matches the request. Clarification from the requester is needed before the workload distribution can be determined.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-04-09

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
