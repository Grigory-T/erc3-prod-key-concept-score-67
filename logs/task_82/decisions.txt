DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:04:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has shown that 'coating project' is ambiguous: it is not a unique or standard internal project designation, and multiple projects with 'coating' in the name exist. According to the original plan, this ambiguity means the next step should attempt to match to a specific project, but only if there is a clear candidate. Since Step 2 requires a project search/selection and may identify several possible project candidates or result in a need for clarification, the process should simply continue as planned. There is no failure or unexpected output; the steps remain valid and can still yield the desired result if the appropriate project can be pinpointed in the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:12:06
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
The original plan specified that if clarification is needed regarding which specific 'coating project' is meant (step 1 and 2), further steps depending on a single selected_project_id cannot proceed until clarification is received. Both the wiki and project registry searches did not yield a unique match for 'coating project,' and 17 candidate projects were found; thus, the plan cannot continue without confirmation from the requester. This is consistent with original plan wording: 'If multiple candidate projects are found, mark that clarification is needed instead of auto-selecting one.' Thus, a replan is not appropriate, and the task cannot currently be completed until clarification is provided.
