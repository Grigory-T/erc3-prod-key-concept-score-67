DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:03:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed according to the original plan and returned relevant and correctly scoped data, including normalized terms, interpretations, related wiki paths, and search queries used. There are no indications of missing technical means or incorrect/incomplete data that would warrant replanning at this point. The next logical action per the plan is to proceed to Step 2: identify the available technical implementation for reading wiki pages from storage.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:04:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed steps 1 and 2 delivered the expected results according to the plan—step 1 clarified the meaning and context, and step 2 confirmed that a REST API (with suitable functions) is present for executing searches and reading wiki content. There are no missing functions, unexpected results, or blockers, and the technical mechanism for continuing (step 3) is fully in place. Therefore, the plan remains valid and execution should continue with the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:10:17
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1-3 have been executed fully according to plan, and each step's checklist and expected outcome have been strictly satisfied using only returns from authorized company functions and sources. The next step (Step 4) is to analyze the candidate wiki pages and select the specific page explaining the self skill/will evaluation process, as planned. There is no evidence the plan is invalid or that any required mechanism is missing or failing. No unexpected/inconsistent results are present, and all data needed for the next step is in place.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:16:33
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have executed successfully and in strict accordance with the original plan, with no unexpected issues: step 4 was completed as intended, identifying 'hr/skills_and_wills_model.md' as the main candidate explaining the self skill/will evaluation process. The next step in the plan is to verify read permissions for the selected page, which matches exactly the remaining action required. There have been no errors, technical gaps, or surprising findings necessitating replanning or abort. The plan remains valid and the next logical step is to continue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:18:47
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been completed exactly per the original plan. Step 6 checks if any abort conditions apply: technical mechanism for wiki access exists (REST API); a suitable page ('hr/skills_and_wills_model.md') explaining self skill/will evaluation was found and selected; permissions for the current user (Valentino Serra) to read the page are confirmed. No abort conditions are present. Therefore, the task is fully complete and a definitive final answer can be given, as required by the plan.
