STEP 3 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 22:10:12

I have verified the execution of step 3 against the checklist. All actions were completed as specified:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: Used the identified REST API wiki service functions to perform comprehensive searches for wiki pages related to self skill/will evaluation.

2. **No skipped actions**: Performed multiple search strategies:
   - Exact path matching for Step 1 identified pages
   - Regex pattern matching for all search terms
   - Fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` function
   - HR directory analysis for skill/will related content
   - All results were collected and relevance scores were calculated

3. **All facts verified**: Only data from function returns was used:
   - `list_wiki()` returned 19 total wiki paths
   - `load_wiki()` was used to retrieve content for verification
   - `search_wiki()` was used for regex pattern matching
   - `search_wiki_fuzzy()` was used for fuzzy matching
   - All excerpts and titles were extracted from actual content
   - Relevance scores were calculated based on match type and quality

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The search successfully identified 19 candidate wiki pages with varying relevance scores, with the top 5 pages (from Step 1) having the highest relevance (1.0) as they directly address skills and wills concepts.
