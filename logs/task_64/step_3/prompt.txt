Step 3: Using the identified technical mechanism, query the wiki storage to retrieve all wiki pages related to self skill/will evaluation.
Approach: Based on the chosen_method from step 2 (for example, direct Structured Query Language on the wiki_file table or a REST wiki search endpoint), execute a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content for the normalized and related terms from step 1 (for example, "self skill/will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "self-assessment of skills", "skills & wills form"). Start with exact and substring matches on normalized lowercase text, then apply partial word matching and regular expressions (for example, matching "self" within a nearby window of "skills" and "wills"). Apply fuzzy matching functions (for example, fuzzy_compare on titles and headings, fuzzy_find_in_text on content) and simple natural language processing based semantic similarity (linking "evaluation" with "assessment" or "review"). Collect all candidate wiki_file records whose path or content mention these concepts with a nontrivial relevance. The search must also tolerate possible typos or formatting differences in page names and headings.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","title","excerpt","relevance_score"]}},"search_executed_via":{"type":"string"}},"required":["candidates","search_executed_via"]}
