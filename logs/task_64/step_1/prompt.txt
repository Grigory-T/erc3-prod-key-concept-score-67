Step 1: Clarify what the term "self skill/will evaluation" means in the Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context by searching existing wiki and internal documentation.
Approach: Use the company's wiki and any internal documentation search tools to perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for the term "self skill/will evaluation" and closely related phrases such as "self skill evaluation", "self will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "skills and wills self-evaluation", and "self assessment of skills and wills". The search should account for possible misspellings, variations, and abbreviations (for example, "skill/will", "skills & wills", "S/W evaluation"). Search both wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content fields, using exact matching first and then progressively relaxing filters: lowercase comparison, substring search, partial word matches, regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g. via fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy). Also consider SEMANTIC / LOGICAL similarity (e.g. matching "self-assessment" with "evaluation") to gather any guideline or process pages that mention self evaluation of skills and wills.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"normalized_term":{"type":"string"},"interpretations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"related_wiki_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"search_queries_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["normalized_term","interpretations","related_wiki_paths","search_queries_used"]}
