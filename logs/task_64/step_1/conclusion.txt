Based on an extensive search of the Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. wiki and internal documentation, I have clarified the meaning of "self skill/will evaluation" in the company context. The exact phrase was not found, but the closest related concept is "SkillWillReflect update," which refers to the process where employees assess and update their own skills (abilities) and wills (interests/aspirations). This process occurs during annual performance reviews and as needed through periodic "SkillWillReflect" updates. It is a shared responsibility between employees and managers to maintain accurate profiles for workforce planning, project assignments, succession planning, and development discussions.
