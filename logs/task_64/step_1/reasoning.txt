--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are tasked with searching the wiki for "self skill/will evaluation" and related phrases.
 We need to perform fuzzy and semantic/logical search.
 Steps:
 1. List all wiki pages to know what we have.
 2. Load each page and search content, or use provided fuzzy search functions.
 3. We have a function `search_wiki_fuzzy` that can search for words in the wiki.
 4. We can also use `fuzzy_find_in_text` if we want to search in a set of texts (but we have wiki function).
 5. We'll try multiple search queries: 
    - "self skill/will evaluation"
    - "self skill evaluation"
    - "self will evaluation"
    - "skills and wills self assessment"
    - "skills and wills self-evaluation"
    - "self assessment of skills and wills"
 6. Also consider abbreviations and variations: "skill/will", "skills & wills", "S/W evaluation", etc.
 7. We'll use `search_wiki_fuzzy` for each word or phrase? The function takes a list of words and returns matches for each word.
    However, note that `search_wiki_fuzzy` searches for each word separately and returns matches for each word.
    We might want to split the phrases into words and also consider the whole phrase.

 Approach:
 - Let's first get the list of wiki pages and their content, then use `fuzzy_find_in_text` for each page and each phrase?
 - Alternatively, we can use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of words extracted from the phrases, but that might miss multi-word phrases.

 Since the task emphasizes fuzzy and semantic, and we have a function that does fuzzy search on the wiki, let's use `search_wiki_fuzzy`.

 However, note: `search_wiki_fuzzy` takes a list of words and returns matches for each word. It does not handle phrases.

 We can also use `fuzzy_find_in_text` by loading each wiki page and then searching for the phrases.

 Let's do both:

 Step 1: List all wiki pages.
 Step 2: For each wiki page, load the content and then use `fuzzy_find_in_text` with the list of phrases.

 But note: `fuzzy_find_in_text` expects a list of target strings and a list of texts (the wiki pages). We can pass each page's content as a text.

 Alternatively, we can concatenate all pages? But then we lose the page boundaries.

 We'll do:

   wiki_pages = list_wiki()
   for path in wiki_pages:
       content = load_wiki(path)
       if content:
           # Use fuzzy_find_in_text for the list of phrases on this content.

 However, `fuzzy_find_in_text` returns matches for each target in each text. We can set a threshold for the ratio (maybe 70%?).

 But note: the task says to use fuzzy and semantic. We'll use the function and then interpret the ratios.

 Alternatively, we can use `search_wiki_fuzzy` for each word in the phrases and then try to see if the context of the matches includes the whole phrase.

 Given the constraints, let's break down:

 We are going to use the following functions:

   list_wiki() -> list of paths
   load_wiki(path) -> content

 Then, for each content, we can use `fuzzy_find_in_text` with the following target phrases:

   targets = [
        "self skill/will evaluation",
        "self skill evaluation",
        "self will evaluation",
        "skills and wills self assessment",
        "skills and wills self-evaluation",
        "self assessment of skills and wills",
        "skill/will",
        "skills & wills",
        "S/W evaluation",
        "self evaluation",
        "self-assessment"
   ]

 We'll set a threshold for the ratio (e.g., 0.7) to consider a match.

 We'll collect the paths that have at least one match.

 We'll also note the matched phrase and the context.

 But note: the function `fuzzy_find_in_text` returns a list of dicts for each target and each text.

 We'll run:

   matches = fuzzy_find_in_text(targets, [content], top_n=10, context_chars=100)

 However, we want to search in each page separately. So we'll loop:

   all_matches = []
   for path in wiki_pages:
        content = load_wiki(path)
        if content:
            matches = fuzzy_find_in_text(targets, [content], top_n=10, context_chars=100)
            for match in matches:
                # match has: target, text_index (0), matched, ratio, position, context
                if match['ratio'] > 0.7:
                    record = {
                        'path': path,
                        'target': match['target'],
                        'matched': match['matched'],
                        'ratio': match['ratio'],
                        'context': match['context']
                    }
                    all_matches.append(record)

 Then, we can extract the unique paths and the phrases that matched.

 However, note: the function `fuzzy_find_in_text` might return multiple matches for the same target in the same text. We'll take unique paths.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We are also asked to return:
   normalized_term: the original term? Or the normalized version? We'll set to the original term: "self skill/will evaluation"
   interpretations: an array of interpretations (the matched phrases and contexts)
   related_wiki_paths: array of unique wiki paths that matched
   search_queries_used: the list of targets we used

 Let's execute.

 But note: the user might have meant a specific wiki page. We should also consider exact matches in the wiki page names.

 We'll also search the wiki page paths for exact and substring matches.

 We'll do:

   wiki_paths = list_wiki()
   path_matches = []
   for path in wiki_paths:
        lower_path = path.lower()
        if any(word in lower_path for word in ['skill', 'will', 'self', 'evaluation', 'assessment']):
            path_matches.append(path)

 Then, we can combine the fuzzy content matches and the path matches.

 However, the task is to clarify the term by searching the wiki. We are to return the wiki paths that are relevant.

 Let's do:

   Step 1: List all wiki pages.
   Step 2: Search in page names (exact, substring, etc.) for the words in the phrases.
   Step 3: Search in page content using fuzzy_find_in_text for the phrases.

 We'll then combine the results.

 Let's code accordingly.

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 21:59:46
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are given a list of wiki pages. We need to search for "self skill/will evaluation" and related terms.
 We'll start by examining the wiki pages that seem most relevant: "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md" and other HR pages.
 We'll use a combination of exact, substring, and fuzzy searches.

 Steps:
 1. List all wiki pages to have a full view.
 2. For each wiki page, we can load its content and search for keywords.
 3. We can also use the provided search functions: search_wiki (regex) and search_wiki_fuzzy (fuzzy).

 However, note that the step asks for a FUZZY and SEMANTIC/LOGICAL search.

 Let's break down the search terms:
   - "self skill/will evaluation"
   - "self skill evaluation"
   - "self will evaluation"
   - "skills and wills self assessment"
   - "skills and wills self-evaluation"
   - "self assessment of skills and wills"
   - variations and abbreviations: "skill/will", "skills & wills", "S/W evaluation"

 We'll use:
   a) search_wiki: for regex search on the content of wiki pages.
   b) search_wiki_fuzzy: for fuzzy search on the wiki.

 We can also do a manual substring search by loading each wiki page and checking for the presence of keywords.

 Since we have 19 pages, we can load them all and search.

 However, the step says to use fuzzy and semantic/logical search. Let's use the provided fuzzy functions.

 We'll do:
  1. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of target words and phrases.
  2. Also, use regex search for more structured patterns.

 Let's define a list of target phrases and words.

 We'll also consider that the term might be broken into multiple words or have different word orders.

 We'll start by using search_wiki_fuzzy with the following words and phrases:

   ["self skill", "self will", "skill/will", "skills and wills", "self assessment", "self evaluation", "S/W evaluation"]

 We'll also try a regex that captures "self" and "skill" or "will" and "evaluation" or "assessment".

 But note: search_wiki_fuzzy expects words (list of strings). We can break the phrases into individual words and also include some phrases.

 However, the function search_wiki_fuzzy does not handle multi-word phrases as a single unit. It will break them into words.

 Alternatively, we can use the fuzzy_find_in_text function by loading each wiki page's content and searching for the target phrases.

 Let's plan:

  Option 1: Use search_wiki_fuzzy with individual words and then look at the context.

  Option 2: Load each wiki page and use fuzzy_find_in_text on the content.

 Since we have a small number of pages, we can do:

  1. For each wiki page:
        content = load_wiki(page)
        if content:
            use fuzzy_find_in_text with a list of target phrases (multi-word) on the content.

  2. Also, use search_wiki (regex) to look for patterns.

 Let's do both.

 We'll also consider that the wiki might have a page dedicated to this topic.

 We'll start by using fuzzy_find_in_text on the entire content of each wiki page.

 Steps:

  a) Get all wiki pages.
  b) For each page, load the content.
  c) Use fuzzy_find_in_text with the following target phrases (list of strings):

        target_phrases = [
            "self skill/will evaluation",
            "self skill evaluation",
            "self will evaluation",
            "skills and wills self assessment",
            "skills and wills self-evaluation",
            "self assessment of skills and wills",
            "skill/will",
            "skills & wills",
            "S/W evaluation"
        ]

  d) We'll set a threshold (say ratio > 70) to consider a match.

  e) Also, we can do a simple substring search for exact words (case-insensitive) as a baseline.

  f) We'll record the page and the matched phrase and context.

  g) We'll also try regex search using search_wiki for patterns like /self.*skill.*will.*evaluation/i.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note that the step says to use the company's wiki and any internal documentation search tools.

 We are only provided with wiki functions, so we'll use them.

 We'll also consider that the term might be in a page that is not in the HR directory.

 Let's start.

 We'll also note that the step asks for:
   - normalized_term: what we think the term means (after searching)
   - interpretations: array of possible interpretations (from the context we find)
   - related_wiki_paths: array of wiki paths that mention the term
   - search_queries_used: array of search queries we used

 We'll collect:

   normalized_term: We'll try to extract the most common term used in the wiki.

   interpretations: We'll read the context and note down what the process is about.

   related_wiki_paths: The paths of wiki pages that contain relevant information.

   search_queries_used: The list of search strings and methods we used.

 Let's code.

We need to search for "self skill/will evaluation" and related terms. The fuzzy search returned 220 results but we didn't see them printed because the ratio threshold was >70 and maybe none met that. Let's examine the fuzzy results more carefully and also try other semantic searches.

Let me also check the content of the skills_and_wills_model.md more thoroughly for any mention of self-evaluation. Also, we can search for "SkillWillReflect" which might be a process.

We should also consider that the term might be in other forms like "self-evaluation of skills and wills", "personal skill assessment", etc.

Let me run additional searches:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #4] 2025-12-09 22:02:46
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are searching for the term "self skill/will evaluation" in the context of Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
 We have performed various searches: substring, regex, fuzzy, and semantic. We found that the term "self skill/will evaluation" does not appear exactly in the wiki, but we found related concepts.

 From the search, we see:
 1. The main page about skills and wills is `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md`.
 2. In that page, we found the term "SkillWillReflect update" which is a process where employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews.
 3. The page also mentions that employees and managers update skills and wills during annual reviews.
 4. We did not find a dedicated page for self skill/will evaluation, but the concept is part of the skills and wills model.

 Let's interpret the term "self skill/will evaluation" as the process where employees assess their own skills and wills, possibly as part of the "SkillWillReflect update" or during annual reviews.

 We have found several wiki pages that mention skills and wills, but the most relevant one for the evaluation process is `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md`.

 We also note that the chatbot interface page (`systems/chatbot_interface.md`) mentions that the chatbot can update skills and wills, which might be part of the self-evaluation process.

 Based on the search, we can define:
 - Normalized term: "SkillWillReflect update" (as found in the wiki) or "skills and wills self-assessment"
 - Interpretations: The process by which employees assess and update their own skills and wills, either during annual reviews or as part of a periodic self-reflection (SkillWillReflect update).
 - Related wiki paths: The main page is `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md`. Also, other pages that mention skills and wills might be relevant for context.

 Let's compile the results.

Based on the comprehensive search performed, I can now provide the final answer in the requested JSON format.

The searches conducted included:
- Substring searches for various phrases related to "self skill/will evaluation"
- Regex pattern matching for semantic variations
- Fuzzy matching to account for misspellings and variations
- Semantic searches for related concepts like annual reviews and performance reviews
- Specific search for the term "SkillWillReflect"

The findings indicate that the exact phrase "self skill/will evaluation" is not used in the Bellini wiki, but the closely related concept is "SkillWillReflect update" which is part of the skills and wills maintenance process. The primary documentation is in the hr/skills_and_wills_model.md page, with supporting information in other HR and systems pages.

Here is the final output:

The user asks for verification of the step execution. I need to review if I executed all required actions and if the JSON output contains only verified facts.

Step 1: Clarify the term "self skill/will evaluation". Approach: Use wiki and internal documentation search tools to perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC/LOGICAL search for the term and related phrases, accounting for misspellings, variations, abbreviations. Search both wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content fields, using exact matching, then progressively relaxing filters: lowercase comparison, substring search, partial word matches, regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores. Also consider semantic/logical similarity.

I executed the following:

1. Listed all wiki pages (19 pages).
2. Defined search terms and variations.
3. Performed substring search in wiki content (Approach 1). Found pages containing "skills & wills" but not exact phrases like "self skill evaluation". Printed results.
4. Performed regex search (Approach 2) with patterns like "self.*skill.*will.*eval". No results found.
5. Performed fuzzy search using search_wiki_fuzzy (Approach 3). Got 220 results, examined those with ratio >70, printed matches by page. Found high matches for "skills & wills" but not for "self skill evaluation". Some fuzzy matches for "self evaluation" but not specific to skills/wills.
6. Checked HR pages specifically (Approach 4), looking for self-assessment indicators. Found "review" mentions, but not explicit self-evaluation.
7. Detailed analysis of fuzzy results: grouped by page, showed top matches.
8. Semantic search for related concepts: "annual review", "performance review", etc. Found "annual review" in skills_and_wills_model.md line 31.
9. Searched for "SkillWillReflect" explicitly, found it in skills_and_wills_model.md line 32.
10. Examined full content of skills_and_wills_model.md for self-assessment context. Found section "Principles for keeping profiles up to date" which includes mention of SkillWillReflect update.
11. Checked other HR pages for self-assessment processes.

All searches were performed as described. I used multiple search methods: exact substring, regex, fuzzy, semantic. I considered variations and abbreviations.

The JSON output I provided includes:
- normalized_term: "SkillWillReflect update / skills and wills self-assessment" – derived from the found term "SkillWillReflect update" and the context.
- interpretations: Four interpretations based on the content found, especially the principles in skills_and_wills_model.md.
- related_wiki_paths: Five paths that were found to contain relevant information.
- search_queries_used: List of search types executed.

All facts are derived from function returns: I printed the results of each search. The term "SkillWillReflect update" was explicitly found in line 32 of hr/skills_and_wills_model.md (printed). The principles were printed from that file. The related wiki paths were identified through searches and printed.

I did not use any make-up data. I verified that the exact phrase "self skill/will evaluation" was not found, but through semantic and fuzzy search, I identified the closest concept.

I did not change any state (no update functions called).

Thus, I believe I executed the step completely. I will repeat the final_answer and JSON blocks.
