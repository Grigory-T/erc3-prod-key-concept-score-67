Step 4: From the candidate wiki pages, select the primary wiki page that specifically explains the self skill/will evaluation process.
Approach: Analyze the candidate list from step 3 and rank pages primarily by relevance_score, but also by **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** fit to the task of explaining the self skill/will evaluation process. Prefer pages whose path or title explicitly include terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation", "skills_and_wills_self_assessment", "how_to_fill_skills_and_wills", or similar phrases. Within each candidate's excerpt or full content (if needed), look for procedural language (for example, "how to evaluate your skills and wills", "steps for self evaluation", "employees must rate their skills and wills") indicating that the page explains the process rather than merely referencing it. Use fuzzy logic to tolerate small differences and typos in path or title. If multiple high-scoring pages exist, apply deterministic tie-breaking rules (for example, highest relevance_score, then shortest path, then most recent updated_at) and set a flag indicating that multiple plausible pages existed. If no candidates clearly describe the process, leave the selected page null and note that no suitable page was found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_title":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_relevance":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_plausible_pages":{"type":"boolean"},"all_considered_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["selected_page_path","selected_page_title","selected_page_relevance","multiple_plausible_pages","all_considered_paths"]}
