STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 22:16:27

I have completed Step 4 by analyzing all candidate wiki pages from Step 3. The analysis involved:

1. **Examining all 19 candidate pages** from Step 3, with particular focus on the top 5 pages with relevance_score 1.0
2. **Ranking pages by relevance_score and semantic/logical fit** for explaining the self skill/will evaluation process
3. **Searching for procedural language** indicating process explanation rather than mere reference
4. **Applying tie-breaking rules** when multiple high-scoring pages existed

Key findings:
- No page has explicit terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation" or "skills_and_wills_self_assessment" in path or title
- The page "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md" has the highest process explanation score and contains references to the self-evaluation process (including "SkillWillReflect update" and instructions for updating skills and wills)
- Multiple pages have high relevance scores (1.0) and process scores (>20), indicating multiple plausible candidates exist
- No dedicated process/guide/howto pages were found in the wiki

All facts were verified through function returns (load_wiki, list_wiki, etc.) with no assumptions or made-up data.
