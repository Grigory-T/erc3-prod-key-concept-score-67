## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-27
Current actor: Authenticated user iv5n_039
User details: {"id": "iv5n_039", "name": "Valentino Serra", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** What wiki page explains self skill/will evaluation?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify what the term "self skill/will evaluation" means in the Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context by searching existing wiki and internal documentation.
Approach: Use the company's wiki and any internal documentation search tools to perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for the term "self skill/will evaluation" and closely related phrases such as "self skill evaluation", "self will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "skills and wills self-evaluation", and "self assessment of skills and wills". The search should account for possible misspellings, variations, and abbreviations (for example, "skill/will", "skills & wills", "S/W evaluation"). Search both wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content fields, using exact matching first and then progressively relaxing filters: lowercase comparison, substring search, partial word matches, regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g. via fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy). Also consider SEMANTIC / LOGICAL similarity (e.g. matching "self-assessment" with "evaluation") to gather any guideline or process pages that mention self evaluation of skills and wills.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"normalized_term":{"type":"string"},"interpretations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"related_wiki_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"search_queries_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["normalized_term","interpretations","related_wiki_paths","search_queries_used"]}
**Result:** Based on an extensive search of the Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. wiki and internal documentation, I have clarified the meaning of "self skill/will evaluation" in the company context. The exact phrase was not found, but the closest related concept is "SkillWillReflect update," which refers to the process where employees assess and update their own skills (abilities) and wills (interests/aspirations). This process occurs during annual performance reviews and as needed through periodic "SkillWillReflect" updates. It is a shared responsibility between employees and managers to maintain accurate profiles for workforce planning, project assignments, succession planning, and development discussions.

{
  "normalized_term": "SkillWillReflect update / skills and wills self-assessment",
  "interpretations": [
    "Process where employees assess and update their own skills (abilities) and wills (interests/aspirations)",
    "Occurs during annual performance reviews and as part of periodic 'SkillWillReflect' updates",
    "Shared responsibility between employees and managers to maintain accurate profiles",
    "Used for workforce planning, project assignments, succession planning, and development discussions"
  ],
  "related_wiki_paths": [
    "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md",
    "hr/people_and_roles.md",
    "systems/employee_registry.md",
    "systems/chatbot_interface.md",
    "index.md"
  ],
  "search_queries_used": [
    "substring: self skill evaluation, self will evaluation, skills & wills self assessment",
    "regex: self.*skill.*will.*eval, skill.*will.*self.*eval",
    "fuzzy: all variations of search terms with ratio > 70",
    "semantic: annual review, performance review, development discussion",
    "exact: SkillWillReflect"
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the available technical implementation (functions, application programming interfaces, services, or direct database access) for reading wiki pages from the wiki_file storage.
Approach: Search internal technical documentation, developer wiki pages, and code repositories using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like "wiki_file", "wiki api", "wiki service", "documentation service", "markdown wiki storage", and similar phrases. Account for typos and naming variations (for example, "wikifile", "wiki-files", "doc_service"). Determine whether the canonical way to access wiki content is via direct Structured Query Language queries on the wiki_file table, a dedicated REST or GraphQL endpoint, or another service. If multiple mechanisms exist, select the recommended or most stable one according to the documentation. If no concrete implementation (Structured Query Language interface, service endpoint, or library) is found, mark that no direct api/functions exist for this task so that an abort step can be executed later.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_sql_access":{"type":"boolean"},"has_rest_api":{"type":"boolean"},"has_other_method":{"type":"boolean"},"chosen_method":{"type":["string","null"]},"documentation_references":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["has_sql_access","has_rest_api","has_other_method","chosen_method","documentation_references"]}
**Result:** I have performed an extensive technical documentation search using the available wiki search functions. Below are the explicit findings from the actual function returns, showing the verified implementation details.

{
  "has_sql_access": false,
  "has_rest_api": true,
  "has_other_method": false,
  "chosen_method": "REST API via dedicated wiki service functions (load_wiki, search_wiki, list_wiki, update_wiki)",
  "documentation_references": [
    "systems/wiki_service.md",
    "api/endpoints.md",
    "systems/architecture_overview.md",
    "development/api_usage_examples.md"
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Using the identified technical mechanism, query the wiki storage to retrieve all wiki pages related to self skill/will evaluation.
Approach: Based on the chosen_method from step 2 (for example, direct Structured Query Language on the wiki_file table or a REST wiki search endpoint), execute a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content for the normalized and related terms from step 1 (for example, "self skill/will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "self-assessment of skills", "skills & wills form"). Start with exact and substring matches on normalized lowercase text, then apply partial word matching and regular expressions (for example, matching "self" within a nearby window of "skills" and "wills"). Apply fuzzy matching functions (for example, fuzzy_compare on titles and headings, fuzzy_find_in_text on content) and simple natural language processing based semantic similarity (linking "evaluation" with "assessment" or "review"). Collect all candidate wiki_file records whose path or content mention these concepts with a nontrivial relevance. The search must also tolerate possible typos or formatting differences in page names and headings.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","title","excerpt","relevance_score"]}},"search_executed_via":{"type":"string"}},"required":["candidates","search_executed_via"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of step 3 against the checklist. All actions were completed as specified:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: Used the identified REST API wiki service functions to perform comprehensive searches for wiki pages related to self skill/will evaluation.

2. **No skipped actions**: Performed multiple search strategies:
   - Exact path matching for Step 1 identified pages
   - Regex pattern matching for all search terms
   - Fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` function
   - HR directory analysis for skill/will related content
   - All results were collected and relevance scores were calculated

3. **All facts verified**: Only data from function returns was used:
   - `list_wiki()` returned 19 total wiki paths
   - `load_wiki()` was used to retrieve content for verification
   - `search_wiki()` was used for regex pattern matching
   - `search_wiki_fuzzy()` was used for fuzzy matching
   - All excerpts and titles were extracted from actual content
   - Relevance scores were calculated based on match type and quality

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The search successfully identified 19 candidate wiki pages with varying relevance scores, with the top 5 pages (from Step 1) having the highest relevance (1.0) as they directly address skills and wills concepts.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: From the candidate wiki pages, select the primary wiki page that specifically explains the self skill/will evaluation process.
Approach: Analyze the candidate list from step 3 and rank pages primarily by relevance_score, but also by **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** fit to the task of explaining the self skill/will evaluation process. Prefer pages whose path or title explicitly include terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation", "skills_and_wills_self_assessment", "how_to_fill_skills_and_wills", or similar phrases. Within each candidate's excerpt or full content (if needed), look for procedural language (for example, "how to evaluate your skills and wills", "steps for self evaluation", "employees must rate their skills and wills") indicating that the page explains the process rather than merely referencing it. Use fuzzy logic to tolerate small differences and typos in path or title. If multiple high-scoring pages exist, apply deterministic tie-breaking rules (for example, highest relevance_score, then shortest path, then most recent updated_at) and set a flag indicating that multiple plausible pages existed. If no candidates clearly describe the process, leave the selected page null and note that no suitable page was found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_title":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_relevance":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_plausible_pages":{"type":"boolean"},"all_considered_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["selected_page_path","selected_page_title","selected_page_relevance","multiple_plausible_pages","all_considered_paths"]}

<final_answer>
Based on the analysis of all candidate wiki pages from Step 3, I have selected the primary wiki page that specifically explains the self skill/will evaluation process. The analysis involved examining all 19 candidate pages, with particular focus on the top 5 pages with relevance_score 1.0. 

The selection criteria considered:
1. **Relevance_score** from Step 3
2. **Process explanation indicators**: presence of procedural language, imperative verbs, step-by-step instructions
3. **Content analysis**: examination of actual content for self-evaluation process descriptions
4. **Path/title relevance**: whether the path or title explicitly indicates skill/will processes

The analysis revealed that while multiple pages mention skills and wills, only one page provides substantial detail about the evaluation process itself. However, three pages showed high process explanation scores (>20), indicating multiple plausible candidates exist.

The primary page was selected based on its comprehensive coverage of the skills and wills model and explicit references to the self-evaluation process (including "SkillWillReflect update").

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: From the candidate wiki pages, select the primary wiki page that specifically explains the self skill/will evaluation process.
Approach: Analyze the candidate list from step 3 and rank pages primarily by relevance_score, but also by **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** fit to the task of explaining the self skill/will evaluation process. Prefer pages whose path or title explicitly include terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation", "skills_and_wills_self_assessment", "how_to_fill_skills_and_wills", or similar phrases. Within each candidate's excerpt or full content (if needed), look for procedural language (for example, "how to evaluate your skills and wills", "steps for self evaluation", "employees must rate their skills and wills") indicating that the page explains the process rather than merely referencing it. Use fuzzy logic to tolerate small differences and typos in path or title. If multiple high-scoring pages exist, apply deterministic tie-breaking rules (for example, highest relevance_score, then shortest path, then most recent updated_at) and set a flag indicating that multiple plausible pages existed. If no candidates clearly describe the process, leave the selected page null and note that no suitable page was found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_title":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_relevance":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_plausible_pages":{"type":"boolean"},"all_considered_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["selected_page_path","selected_page_title","selected_page_relevance","multiple_plausible_pages","all_considered_paths"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have completed Step 4 by analyzing all candidate wiki pages from Step 3. The analysis involved:

1. **Examining all 19 candidate pages** from Step 3, with particular focus on the top 5 pages with relevance_score 1.0
2. **Ranking pages by relevance_score and semantic/logical fit** for explaining the self skill/will evaluation process
3. **Searching for procedural language** indicating process explanation rather than mere reference
4. **Applying tie-breaking rules** when multiple high-scoring pages existed

Key findings:
- No page has explicit terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation" or "skills_and_wills_self_assessment" in path or title
- The page "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md" has the highest process explanation score and contains references to the self-evaluation process (including "SkillWillReflect update" and instructions for updating skills and wills)
- Multiple pages have high relevance scores (1.0) and process scores (>20), indicating multiple plausible candidates exist
- No dedicated process/guide/howto pages were found in the wiki

All facts were verified through function returns (load_wiki, list_wiki, etc.) with no assumptions or made-up data.
