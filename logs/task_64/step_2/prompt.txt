Step 2: Identify the available technical implementation (functions, application programming interfaces, services, or direct database access) for reading wiki pages from the wiki_file storage.
Approach: Search internal technical documentation, developer wiki pages, and code repositories using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like "wiki_file", "wiki api", "wiki service", "documentation service", "markdown wiki storage", and similar phrases. Account for typos and naming variations (for example, "wikifile", "wiki-files", "doc_service"). Determine whether the canonical way to access wiki content is via direct Structured Query Language queries on the wiki_file table, a dedicated REST or GraphQL endpoint, or another service. If multiple mechanisms exist, select the recommended or most stable one according to the documentation. If no concrete implementation (Structured Query Language interface, service endpoint, or library) is found, mark that no direct api/functions exist for this task so that an abort step can be executed later.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_sql_access":{"type":"boolean"},"has_rest_api":{"type":"boolean"},"has_other_method":{"type":"boolean"},"chosen_method":{"type":["string","null"]},"documentation_references":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["has_sql_access","has_rest_api","has_other_method","chosen_method","documentation_references"]}
