Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Valentino Serra) to read the selected wiki page, using who_am_i() and any wiki access control lists.
Approach: Call who_am_i() or the equivalent identity service to confirm the current authenticated user is Valentino Serra (employee id "iv5n_039") from the R&D and Technical Service department at HQ – Italy. Using this bound identity, query the wiki or documentation access control subsystem to verify read permissions for the selected_page_path from step 4. Follow company policies: ensure that only authorized employees can read the page and that no additional privileges are assumed beyond Valentino's actual system roles. If the wiki is globally readable to internal employees, confirm this explicitly; otherwise, check for page-level or folder-level access rules. The check must be performed after the target page path is known, and must yield an explicit allow/deny decision plus a short non-sensitive explanation in case of denial.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"read_allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","selected_page_path","read_allowed","denial_reason"]}
