Completed: 2025-12-09 22:18:41

I have completed step 5 by thoroughly checking permissions and access restrictions for the current user. All actions were executed as specified:

1. **Called who_am_i()** to verify the authenticated user: Valentino Serra (iv5n_039), R&D and Technical Service department, HQ – Italy.
2. **Attempted to load the selected wiki page** using load_wiki("hr/skills_and_wills_model.md") - successful, confirming read access.
3. **Checked available wiki structure** using list_wiki() - found 19 total pages, 3 in HR directory.
4. **Verified general HR documentation access** by loading another HR page - successful.
5. **Examined content for sensitive information** - no salary, HR notes, or restricted content found.
6. **Applied company rules** - user is authenticated (not public), wiki appears globally readable to internal employees, no access restrictions detected.

All facts were verified through function returns: who_am_i(), load_wiki(), list_wiki(). No state-changing operations were performed.
