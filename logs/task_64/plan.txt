Steps:
  1. Clarify what the term "self skill/will evaluation" means in the Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. context by searching existing wiki and internal documentation.
     Approach: Use the company's wiki and any internal documentation search tools to perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for the term "self skill/will evaluation" and closely related phrases such as "self skill evaluation", "self will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "skills and wills self-evaluation", and "self assessment of skills and wills". The search should account for possible misspellings, variations, and abbreviations (for example, "skill/will", "skills & wills", "S/W evaluation"). Search both wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content fields, using exact matching first and then progressively relaxing filters: lowercase comparison, substring search, partial word matches, regular expressions, and fuzzy matching scores (e.g. via fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy). Also consider SEMANTIC / LOGICAL similarity (e.g. matching "self-assessment" with "evaluation") to gather any guideline or process pages that mention self evaluation of skills and wills.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"normalized_term":{"type":"string"},"interpretations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"related_wiki_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"search_queries_used":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["normalized_term","interpretations","related_wiki_paths","search_queries_used"]}
  2. Identify the available technical implementation (functions, application programming interfaces, services, or direct database access) for reading wiki pages from the wiki_file storage.
     Approach: Search internal technical documentation, developer wiki pages, and code repositories using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like "wiki_file", "wiki api", "wiki service", "documentation service", "markdown wiki storage", and similar phrases. Account for typos and naming variations (for example, "wikifile", "wiki-files", "doc_service"). Determine whether the canonical way to access wiki content is via direct Structured Query Language queries on the wiki_file table, a dedicated REST or GraphQL endpoint, or another service. If multiple mechanisms exist, select the recommended or most stable one according to the documentation. If no concrete implementation (Structured Query Language interface, service endpoint, or library) is found, mark that no direct api/functions exist for this task so that an abort step can be executed later.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_sql_access":{"type":"boolean"},"has_rest_api":{"type":"boolean"},"has_other_method":{"type":"boolean"},"chosen_method":{"type":["string","null"]},"documentation_references":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["has_sql_access","has_rest_api","has_other_method","chosen_method","documentation_references"]}
  3. Using the identified technical mechanism, query the wiki storage to retrieve all wiki pages related to self skill/will evaluation.
     Approach: Based on the chosen_method from step 2 (for example, direct Structured Query Language on the wiki_file table or a REST wiki search endpoint), execute a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content for the normalized and related terms from step 1 (for example, "self skill/will evaluation", "skills and wills self assessment", "self-assessment of skills", "skills & wills form"). Start with exact and substring matches on normalized lowercase text, then apply partial word matching and regular expressions (for example, matching "self" within a nearby window of "skills" and "wills"). Apply fuzzy matching functions (for example, fuzzy_compare on titles and headings, fuzzy_find_in_text on content) and simple natural language processing based semantic similarity (linking "evaluation" with "assessment" or "review"). Collect all candidate wiki_file records whose path or content mention these concepts with a nontrivial relevance. The search must also tolerate possible typos or formatting differences in page names and headings.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"title":{"type":"string"},"excerpt":{"type":"string"},"relevance_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","title","excerpt","relevance_score"]}},"search_executed_via":{"type":"string"}},"required":["candidates","search_executed_via"]}
  4. From the candidate wiki pages, select the primary wiki page that specifically explains the self skill/will evaluation process.
     Approach: Analyze the candidate list from step 3 and rank pages primarily by relevance_score, but also by **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** fit to the task of explaining the self skill/will evaluation process. Prefer pages whose path or title explicitly include terms like "self_skill_will_evaluation", "skills_and_wills_self_assessment", "how_to_fill_skills_and_wills", or similar phrases. Within each candidate's excerpt or full content (if needed), look for procedural language (for example, "how to evaluate your skills and wills", "steps for self evaluation", "employees must rate their skills and wills") indicating that the page explains the process rather than merely referencing it. Use fuzzy logic to tolerate small differences and typos in path or title. If multiple high-scoring pages exist, apply deterministic tie-breaking rules (for example, highest relevance_score, then shortest path, then most recent updated_at) and set a flag indicating that multiple plausible pages existed. If no candidates clearly describe the process, leave the selected page null and note that no suitable page was found.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_title":{"type":["string","null"]},"selected_page_relevance":{"type":["number","null"]},"multiple_plausible_pages":{"type":"boolean"},"all_considered_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["selected_page_path","selected_page_title","selected_page_relevance","multiple_plausible_pages","all_considered_paths"]}
  5. Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Valentino Serra) to read the selected wiki page, using who_am_i() and any wiki access control lists.
     Approach: Call who_am_i() or the equivalent identity service to confirm the current authenticated user is Valentino Serra (employee id "iv5n_039") from the R&D and Technical Service department at HQ – Italy. Using this bound identity, query the wiki or documentation access control subsystem to verify read permissions for the selected_page_path from step 4. Follow company policies: ensure that only authorized employees can read the page and that no additional privileges are assumed beyond Valentino's actual system roles. If the wiki is globally readable to internal employees, confirm this explicitly; otherwise, check for page-level or folder-level access rules. The check must be performed after the target page path is known, and must yield an explicit allow/deny decision plus a short non-sensitive explanation in case of denial.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"selected_page_path":{"type":["string","null"]},"read_allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["employee_id","selected_page_path","read_allowed","denial_reason"]}
  6. If no direct api/functions exist to access the wiki, if no suitable wiki page was found, or if permissions are denied, abort the task explicitly as not implemented or not accessible.
     Approach: Inspect outputs from steps 2, 4, and 5. If step 2 indicates that there is no valid technical mechanism available (has_sql_access, has_rest_api, and has_other_method are all false or chosen_method is null), set will_abort to true with abort_reason "not implemented functionality: no available api/service to read wiki pages". If step 4 shows selected_page_path is null (no suitable page explaining self skill/will evaluation was found), set will_abort to true with abort_reason "no wiki page found explaining self skill/will evaluation". If step 5 indicates read_allowed is false, set will_abort to true with abort_reason "access denied to wiki page explaining self skill/will evaluation". If none of these error conditions hold, set will_abort to false and abort_reason to null, meaning the task can be completed and the identified wiki page can be reported as the answer.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["will_abort","abort_reason"]}
