I have verified the execution of Step 4. I correctly used the selected project ID "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer" from the previous step, retrieved the project details using get_project(), filtered team members with role exactly equal to 'Ops', and collected the employee_id and time_slice values. All facts were explicitly printed and verified from function returns: the project exists, has 3 team members, and exactly one team member (Bhwa_097) has the role 'Ops' with time_slice 0.3. I used the index in the team list as team_member_id. No actions were skipped, no assumptions made, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
  "ops_team_members": [
    {
      "team_member_id": 2,
      "employee_id": "Bhwa_097",
      "time_slice": 0.3
    }
  ]
}
