Step 4: Retrieve all team members with role 'Ops' on the identified primer optimisation project.
Approach: Using the 'selected_project_id' from the previous step (if unique; otherwise use a user-confirmed project id), query the 'team_member' table for rows where 'team_member.project_id' equals this project id and 'team_member.role' equals 'Ops'. Since the 'role' column is constrained by a CHECK constraint, use exact matching on 'Ops'. Handle the possibility that zero, one, or multiple team members have the 'Ops' role. Do not perform any additional actions in this step beyond retrieving the relevant 'employee_id' and 'time_slice' values associated with the 'Ops' role for this project.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"project_id": {"type": "string"}, "ops_team_members": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"team_member_id": {"type": "integer"}, "employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "time_slice": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["team_member_id", "employee_id"]}}}, "required": ["project_id", "ops_team_members"]}
