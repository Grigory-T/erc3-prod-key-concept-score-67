I have successfully executed Step 3: Located the project corresponding to the 'primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames' using a comprehensive multi-stage search strategy as instructed. The search included:

1. **Exact matching**: Searched for key terms like "primer optimisation", "RhineMach", "primer", "optimisation", and "machinery frames" using `search_projects()`
2. **Customer-based search**: Found customer "RhineMach Industrial GROUP" using `search_customers()` and retrieved its associated project
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied `fuzzy_find_in_text()` to all projects using target phrases including the full description
4. **Semantic/logical search**: Analyzed all 36 projects in the system, checking project names, descriptions, and customer relationships
5. **Confidence scoring**: Computed confidence scores based on exact term matches, phrase matches, and fuzzy match ratios

All facts were verified from function returns without assumptions:
- Total projects in system: 36 (from `list_all_projects()`)
- RhineMach customer found: 1 (from `search_customers()`)
- Candidate projects identified: 5 (from multiple search methods)
- Top project details verified: `proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer` has 100% confidence with all search terms matching

No state was changed during this step. All operations were read-only.
