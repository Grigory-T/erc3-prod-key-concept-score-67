I have executed Step 1 as instructed: clarifying the task requirements and identifying the database entities and fields needed to answer the question. I did not perform any data retrieval, only formalized the required tables, relationships, and fields.

The task requires answering: "From which department comes team member with role Ops on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?"

To answer this, I identified the following minimal data needs:

1. **Project entity**: To identify the specific "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" - we need to search for this project by name, description, or customer reference.
2. **Team member data**: Within the project entity, we need to access the team list to find members with the role "Ops".
3. **Employee entity**: For each team member with role "Ops", we need to retrieve their department information.

I have considered company rules about restricted fields (salary, notes) and ensured that only allowed fields are included. The department field is permitted for all employees when accessed via chatbot according to company rules.

No data retrieval was performed, no state was changed, and no assumptions were made about specific project or employee IDs. The analysis is based solely on interpreting the task requirements.

{
  "needed_entities": ["project", "team_member", "employee"],
  "needed_fields": {
    "project": ["id", "name", "description", "customer", "team"],
    "team_member": ["employee", "role"],
    "employee": ["id", "department"]
  }
}
