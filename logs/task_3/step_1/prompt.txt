Step 1: Clarify the task requirements and identify which database entities and fields are needed to answer: 'From which department comes team member with role Ops on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?'
Approach: Interpret the question literally to determine the minimal data needed: (a) identify the relevant project in the 'project' table that corresponds to the primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames, (b) from that project, identify team members with role 'Ops' in the 'team_member' table, and (c) from those team members, retrieve their department from the 'employee' table. Do not perform any data retrieval yet; just formalize which tables, relationships, and fields (excluding restricted ones like salary and notes) are required to fully answer the question.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"needed_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "needed_fields": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "team_member": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "employee": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["project", "team_member", "employee"]}}, "required": ["needed_entities", "needed_fields"]}
