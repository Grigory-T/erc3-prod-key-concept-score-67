Step 2: Check current user permissions (who_am_i) to ensure Viola Messina is allowed to read required non-sensitive fields from project, team_member, and employee tables.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and role lookup to confirm the current user is 'Bhwa_001' (Viola Messina) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, verify that reading: project (id, name, description, customer_id), team_member (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice), and employee (id, name, email, location, department) is allowed, explicitly excluding restricted fields (salary, notes). Confirm that no write operations are needed and that no sensitive salary or confidential human resources notes will be accessed. If any required access would violate policy, record that and plan to abort; otherwise, mark access as allowed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_department": {"type": "string"}, "user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "access_allowed": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["user_id", "user_department", "user_roles", "access_allowed"]}
