## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-22
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_001
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** From which department comes team member with role Ops on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify the task requirements and identify which database entities and fields are needed to answer: 'From which department comes team member with role Ops on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?'
Approach: Interpret the question literally to determine the minimal data needed: (a) identify the relevant project in the 'project' table that corresponds to the primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames, (b) from that project, identify team members with role 'Ops' in the 'team_member' table, and (c) from those team members, retrieve their department from the 'employee' table. Do not perform any data retrieval yet; just formalize which tables, relationships, and fields (excluding restricted ones like salary and notes) are required to fully answer the question.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"needed_entities": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "needed_fields": {"type": "object", "properties": {"project": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "team_member": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "employee": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["project", "team_member", "employee"]}}, "required": ["needed_entities", "needed_fields"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 as instructed: clarifying the task requirements and identifying the database entities and fields needed to answer the question. I did not perform any data retrieval, only formalized the required tables, relationships, and fields.

The task requires answering: "From which department comes team member with role Ops on primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames?"

To answer this, I identified the following minimal data needs:

1. **Project entity**: To identify the specific "primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames" - we need to search for this project by name, description, or customer reference.
2. **Team member data**: Within the project entity, we need to access the team list to find members with the role "Ops".
3. **Employee entity**: For each team member with role "Ops", we need to retrieve their department information.

I have considered company rules about restricted fields (salary, notes) and ensured that only allowed fields are included. The department field is permitted for all employees when accessed via chatbot according to company rules.

No data retrieval was performed, no state was changed, and no assumptions were made about specific project or employee IDs. The analysis is based solely on interpreting the task requirements.

{
  "needed_entities": ["project", "team_member", "employee"],
  "needed_fields": {
    "project": ["id", "name", "description", "customer", "team"],
    "team_member": ["employee", "role"],
    "employee": ["id", "department"]
  }
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Check current user permissions (who_am_i) to ensure Viola Messina is allowed to read required non-sensitive fields from project, team_member, and employee tables.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and role lookup to confirm the current user is 'Bhwa_001' (Viola Messina) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, verify that reading: project (id, name, description, customer_id), team_member (project_id, employee_id, role, time_slice), and employee (id, name, email, location, department) is allowed, explicitly excluding restricted fields (salary, notes). Confirm that no write operations are needed and that no sensitive salary or confidential human resources notes will be accessed. If any required access would violate policy, record that and plan to abort; otherwise, mark access as allowed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"user_id": {"type": "string"}, "user_department": {"type": "string"}, "user_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}, "access_allowed": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["user_id", "user_department", "user_roles", "access_allowed"]}

[ASSISTANT] (message 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute Step 2 by checking the current user's permissions to access the required non-sensitive fields.

```python
# Action 1: Get current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User ID: {ctx.current_user}")
print(f"Department: {ctx.department}")
print(f"Location: {ctx.location}")
print(f"Is Public: {ctx.is_public}")
print(f"Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Check if user is authenticated
if ctx.is_public:
    print("ERROR: User is public/guest - access denied")
    access_allowed = False
    denial_reason = "User is a public guest, not an authenticated employee"
else:
    # User is authenticated - check department and access permissions
    print(f"User is authenticated as {ctx.current_user} from {ctx.department}")
    
    # According to company rules:
    # 1. Reading project fields (id, name, description, customer, team) - likely allowed for all authenticated users
    # 2. Reading team member fields (employee, role) - part of project data, likely allowed
    # 3. Reading employee department - explicitly allowed for all employees via chatbot per company rules
    
    # Check if user has access to non-sensitive fields:
    # - Employee department is in ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, ...}
    # - Project and team data doesn't have explicit read restrictions in the rules
    # - User is from Corporate Leadership (executive level), which typically has broad read access
    
    # No salary or confidential notes are being accessed
    # No write operations are needed for this task
    
    access_allowed = True
    denial_reason = ""
    
    print("Access analysis:")
    print("- Required fields: project (id, name, description, customer, team)")
    print("- Required fields: team member (employee, role)")
    print("- Required fields: employee (id, department)")
    print("- No salary or HR notes being accessed")
    print("- No write operations needed")
    print(f"- User department: {ctx.department} (Corporate Leadership)")
    
# Action 3: Get employee details to check system roles (if available)
employee = get_employee(ctx.current_user)
if employee:
    print(f"\nEmployee record found: {employee.name}")
    print(f"Department from employee record: {employee.department}")
    # Note: EmployeeFull model doesn't have system_roles field
    # We cannot retrieve system_roles via available functions
else:
    print(f"\nEmployee record not found for {ctx.current_user}")

# Based on available information, user roles cannot be retrieved directly
# We'll use an empty array for user_roles
user_roles = []
print(f"\nSystem roles (not available via API): {user_roles}")

[ASSISTANT] (message 4)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<final_answer>
I have executed Step 2 to check current user permissions. Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) is authenticated and from the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules and the analysis of required data access:

1. The user is authenticated (not a public/guest user)
2. The required fields are all non-sensitive: project (id, name, description, customer, team), team member (employee, role), and employee (id, department)
3. No salary or confidential HR notes are being accessed
4. No write operations are needed for this task
5. The user's department is Corporate Leadership (executive level), which typically has broad read access
6. According to company rules, reading employee department is explicitly allowed for all employees when accessed via chatbot

Therefore, access to the required data is allowed. Note that system roles cannot be retrieved via the available API functions, so an empty array is returned for user_roles.

No state was changed during this step.

- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 2 as required:

1. I called `who_am_i()` to verify the current user identity: Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy, authenticated (not public).
2. I analyzed company rules to verify reading permissions for the required fields:
   - Project fields (id, name, description, customer, team): No explicit read restrictions in company rules.
   - Team member fields (employee, role): Part of project team data, accessible with project.
   - Employee department: Explicitly allowed for all employees via chatbot according to company rules (ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes department).
3. I confirmed that no restricted fields (salary, HR notes) will be accessed.
4. I confirmed that no write operations are needed for this task.
5. I attempted to retrieve system roles via `get_employee`, but the EmployeeFull model doesn't contain a system_roles field, so user_roles remains an empty array.
6. Based on all checks, access to the required non-sensitive fields is allowed.

No state was changed during this step. All facts were verified from function returns without assumptions.
