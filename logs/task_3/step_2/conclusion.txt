I have executed Step 2 as required:

1. I called `who_am_i()` to verify the current user identity: Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ – Italy, authenticated (not public).
2. I analyzed company rules to verify reading permissions for the required fields:
   - Project fields (id, name, description, customer, team): No explicit read restrictions in company rules.
   - Team member fields (employee, role): Part of project team data, accessible with project.
   - Employee department: Explicitly allowed for all employees via chatbot according to company rules (ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES includes department).
3. I confirmed that no restricted fields (salary, HR notes) will be accessed.
4. I confirmed that no write operations are needed for this task.
5. I attempted to retrieve system roles via `get_employee`, but the EmployeeFull model doesn't contain a system_roles field, so user_roles remains an empty array.
6. Based on all checks, access to the required non-sensitive fields is allowed.

No state was changed during this step. All facts were verified from function returns without assumptions.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "user_department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "user_roles": [],
  "access_allowed": true,
  "denial_reason": ""
