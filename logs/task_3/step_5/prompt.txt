Step 5: Determine from which department(s) the identified Ops team member(s) come by querying the employee table.
Approach: For each 'employee_id' obtained in the previous step, query the 'employee' table to retrieve only the non-sensitive fields necessary to answer the question: 'employee.id', 'employee.name', 'employee.location', and 'employee.department'. Explicitly avoid selecting 'salary' and 'notes' to comply with access rules. Compile a mapping from each Ops team member to their department and derive the distinct list of departments represented. These department names will directly answer the question about which department the Ops team member on the primer optimisation project for RhineMach machinery frames comes from.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"ops_employees": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "employee_name": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "employee_name", "department"]}}, "distinct_departments": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["ops_employees", "distinct_departments"]}
