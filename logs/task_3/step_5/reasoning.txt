We are in Step 5. We have the project ID and the Ops team member from Step 4.
 From Step 4, we have:
   project_id: "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer"
   ops_team_members: [{"team_member_id": 2, "employee_id": "Bhwa_097", "time_slice": 0.3}]

 We need to query the employee table for each employee_id (here only one: Bhwa_097) to get non-sensitive fields: id, name, location, department.
 We must avoid salary and notes.

 Approach:
 1. For each employee_id in ops_team_members, call get_employee(employee_id).
 2. From the returned EmployeeFull object, extract id, name, location, and department.
 3. Compile a list of these employees with their details.
 4. Collect the distinct departments from these employees.

 Note: According to company rules, when accessing via chatbot, we are allowed to see:
   ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
   So department is allowed.

 We must also check that the user is allowed to read these fields. We already did in Step 2 and found access_allowed: true.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

We are given one Ops team member from the previous step: Bhwa_097 (Aleksa Vidović).
 We have retrieved the employee's details and printed the required non-sensitive fields.
 According to the company rules, we are allowed to access: name, email, location, department, etc.
 We have accessed the department: "Production – Serbia".

 We need to compile a mapping from each Ops team member to their department and then derive distinct departments.

 Since there is only one Ops team member, the distinct departments list will have one element.

 However, note that the previous step might have returned multiple Ops team members. But in this case, we have only one.

 Let's structure the output as required.

 Steps:
 1. We already have the employee details for Bhwa_097.
 2. We will create a list of Ops employees with the required properties.
 3. Then, extract the distinct departments from that list.

 Note: We must not include salary or notes. We have printed the employee's details and can confirm we are not using those fields.

 Let's write the output accordingly.

We have successfully retrieved the employee details for the Ops team member (Bhwa_097). The employee is Aleksa Vidović, located in the Serbian Plant, and their department is "Production – Serbia". We have avoided accessing any restricted fields (salary, notes) and only used the allowed fields. The distinct department for the Ops team member is "Production – Serbia".

Now, we need to provide the final answer in the required JSON format. The step is complete.

We have completed Step 5 as required. Let's verify:

1. We executed the step instruction: We queried the employee table for the Ops team member (employee_id: Bhwa_097) obtained from the previous step.
2. We retrieved only the non-sensitive fields: employee.id, employee.name, employee.location, employee.department. We did not access salary or notes (even though the model has them, we didn't use them in the output).
3. We explicitly printed the employee details to verify the data.
4. We then compiled the mapping and derived the distinct departments.
5. All facts were verified from function returns (the employee object was retrieved and printed).
6. We did not use any make-up data or sensible defaults.
7. We did not change any state (only read operations).

Therefore, the results are correct and complete.

Now, we need to provide the final answer and JSON blocks again.
