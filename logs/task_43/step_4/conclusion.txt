STEP 4 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 21:12:25

Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. From the customer candidates identified in Step 3, I selected the most plausible candidate: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) with the highest match_score of 1.0.

2. I queried the project table using exact equality on project.customer_id = "cust_euro_flooring" without any fuzzy matching on the foreign key.

3. I retrieved all projects linked to this customer without filtering by project status.

4. I aggregated all found projects (3 projects) and preserved the association between each project and its customer_id.

All facts were verified from function returns - I used the `search_projects` function with the exact customer_id and printed the results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed.

The verification confirms that:
- I executed the step instruction exactly
- I didn't skip or assume any actions
- All facts were verified from function returns
- No make-up data or sensible defaults were used
- No state was changed
