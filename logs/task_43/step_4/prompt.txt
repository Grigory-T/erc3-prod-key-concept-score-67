Step 4: Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key). Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request status-based filtering. The search should tolerate potential inconsistencies only at the customer-identification stage; here, use the precise customer.id values found. Aggregate all found projects, preserving the association between each project and its customer_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["customer_projects"]}
