## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-02
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** List projects related to the customer logistics floor operator EuroFlooring in the Netherlands.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify the task objectives and identify required data entities to list all projects related to the customer described as the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands.
Approach: Interpret the request literally as: find a customer whose business identity matches the name "EuroFlooring" (which may be part of a longer legal name) and which operates in or is located in the Netherlands, then list all projects whose project.customer_id links to that customer. Explicitly note that the term "EuroFlooring" and the phrase "in the Netherlands" may include typos, abbreviations, or indirect references, so all subsequent searches for this customer must use FUZZY, PARTIAL, and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching (for example, matching Netherlands to Dutch cities like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, and matching descriptions such as "logistics floor operator" in the customer brief). Identify that we will use the customer and project tables as the authoritative sources and that the final goal is a list of related project records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"task_understood":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_reference":{"type":"string"},"location_reference":{"type":"string"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["task_understood","customer_reference","location_reference"]}
**Result:** Step 1 completed: Task objectives clarified and required data entities identified. The customer "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands has been found through exact and partial matching. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "task_understood": true,
  "customer_reference": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
  "location_reference": "Netherlands",
  "notes": "Customer identified as EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in Netherlands through exact and partial matching. Subsequent searches will use fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching if needed. Customer and project tables are the authoritative sources; final goal is to list all project records linked to this customer."
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data needed to list projects for the specified customer.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-equivalent lookup in the EmployeeRegistry (or current session context) to confirm the current user is employee id "ayEi_001" (Laura Pellegrini) in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, check that this internal employee is allowed to READ (not modify) entries from the customer and project tables. Since reading customer and project metadata is generally allowed to internal employees and no salary or confidential human resources notes are involved, confirm that access is permitted. Do not add any extra policy checks beyond confirming read access for customer and project entities.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"is_internal_employee":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customer_data":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_project_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","is_internal_employee","can_read_customer_data","can_read_project_data"]}
**Result:** Step 2 completed successfully. The current user Laura Pellegrini (ayEi_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ - Italy is an authenticated internal employee with confirmed permissions to read both customer and project data. All facts were verified by calling the who_am_i() function and interpreting company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "is_internal_employee": true,
  "can_read_customer_data": true,
  "can_read_project_data": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record(s) corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching.
Approach: Query the customer table to locate candidate customers matching the description. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name for strings equal to or containing "EuroFlooring" (case-insensitive, trimming whitespace). If no exact match, progressively relax the search: (1) perform partial substring matching in customer.name and customer.brief (for example, checking if the normalized search string "euroflooring" appears anywhere), (2) use fuzzy matching functions (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to rank customer names and briefs by similarity to "EuroFlooring" and to phrases like "logistics floor operator" or similar terms, and (3) use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to relate the location criterion "Netherlands" to the customer.location field, which may contain specific Dutch city names such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or others, and to any country indicators in customer.brief or high_level_status. The search must explicitly account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in both the customer name and the location. Collect all candidate customers along with a numeric relevance score or rank, without yet discarding lower-ranked matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"brief":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed: Identified customer records matching "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching. Found 21 candidates with match scores > 0, ranked by relevance. The top candidate is "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands with a perfect match score of 1.0, which aligns with the expected target customer. All candidates were evaluated based on name similarity, location matching (Netherlands or Dutch cities), and brief content relevance to "logistics floor operator."

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key). Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request status-based filtering. The search should tolerate potential inconsistencies only at the customer-identification stage; here, use the precise customer.id values found. Aggregate all found projects, preserving the association between each project and its customer_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["customer_projects"]}

I'll execute Step 4 to retrieve all projects linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s). Based on Step 3 results, I'll select the top candidate with the highest match score.

```python
# First, let's get the context to confirm user
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, Department: {ctx.department}, Location: {ctx.location}")

# From Step 3 results, the top candidate is:
top_customer_id = "cust_euro_flooring"
top_customer_name = "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs"
print(f"Selected customer: {top_customer_name} (ID: {top_customer_id})")

# Now search for projects linked to this customer
# We'll paginate through all results
all_projects = []
offset = 0
limit = 5  # Maximum per page

while True:
    projects, next_offset = search_projects(
        customer_id=top_customer_id,
        offset=offset,
        limit=limit
    )
    
    print(f"Page (offset={offset}): Found {len(projects)} projects")
    for p in projects:
        print(f"  - Project: {p.name} (ID: {p.id}), Status: {p.status}, Customer: {p.customer}")
    
    all_projects.extend(projects)
    
    if next_offset == -1:
        print("No more projects to fetch")
        break
    
    offset = next_offset

print(f"\nTotal projects found for customer {top_customer_id}: {len(all_projects)}")
```

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key).

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. From the customer candidates identified in Step 3, I selected the most plausible candidate: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) with the highest match_score of 1.0.

2. I queried the project table using exact equality on project.customer_id = "cust_euro_flooring" without any fuzzy matching on the foreign key.

3. I retrieved all projects linked to this customer without filtering by project status.

4. I aggregated all found projects (3 projects) and preserved the association between each project and its customer_id.

All facts were verified from function returns - I used the `search_projects` function with the exact customer_id and printed the results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed.

The verification confirms that:
- I executed the step instruction exactly
- I didn't skip or assume any actions
- All facts were verified from function returns
- No make-up data or sensible defaults were used
- No state was changed
