## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify the task objectives and identify required data entities to list all projects related to the customer described as the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands.
Approach: Interpret the request literally as: find a customer whose business identity matches the name "EuroFlooring" (which may be part of a longer legal name) and which operates in or is located in the Netherlands, then list all projects whose project.customer_id links to that customer. Explicitly note that the term "EuroFlooring" and the phrase "in the Netherlands" may include typos, abbreviations, or indirect references, so all subsequent searches for this customer must use FUZZY, PARTIAL, and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching (for example, matching Netherlands to Dutch cities like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, and matching descriptions such as "logistics floor operator" in the customer brief). Identify that we will use the customer and project tables as the authoritative sources and that the final goal is a list of related project records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"task_understood":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_reference":{"type":"string"},"location_reference":{"type":"string"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["task_understood","customer_reference","location_reference"]}
**Result:** Step 1 completed: Task objectives clarified and required data entities identified. The customer "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands has been found through exact and partial matching. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "task_understood": true,
  "customer_reference": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
  "location_reference": "Netherlands",
  "notes": "Customer identified as EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in Netherlands through exact and partial matching. Subsequent searches will use fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching if needed. Customer and project tables are the authoritative sources; final goal is to list all project records linked to this customer."
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data needed to list projects for the specified customer.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-equivalent lookup in the EmployeeRegistry (or current session context) to confirm the current user is employee id "ayEi_001" (Laura Pellegrini) in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, check that this internal employee is allowed to READ (not modify) entries from the customer and project tables. Since reading customer and project metadata is generally allowed to internal employees and no salary or confidential human resources notes are involved, confirm that access is permitted. Do not add any extra policy checks beyond confirming read access for customer and project entities.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"is_internal_employee":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customer_data":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_project_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","is_internal_employee","can_read_customer_data","can_read_project_data"]}
**Result:** Step 2 completed successfully. The current user Laura Pellegrini (ayEi_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ - Italy is an authenticated internal employee with confirmed permissions to read both customer and project data. All facts were verified by calling the who_am_i() function and interpreting company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_001",
  "is_internal_employee": true,
  "can_read_customer_data": true,
  "can_read_project_data": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record(s) corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching.
Approach: Query the customer table to locate candidate customers matching the description. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name for strings equal to or containing "EuroFlooring" (case-insensitive, trimming whitespace). If no exact match, progressively relax the search: (1) perform partial substring matching in customer.name and customer.brief (for example, checking if the normalized search string "euroflooring" appears anywhere), (2) use fuzzy matching functions (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to rank customer names and briefs by similarity to "EuroFlooring" and to phrases like "logistics floor operator" or similar terms, and (3) use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to relate the location criterion "Netherlands" to the customer.location field, which may contain specific Dutch city names such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or others, and to any country indicators in customer.brief or high_level_status. The search must explicitly account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in both the customer name and the location. Collect all candidate customers along with a numeric relevance score or rank, without yet discarding lower-ranked matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"brief":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed: Identified customer records matching "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching. Found 21 candidates with match scores > 0, ranked by relevance. The top candidate is "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands with a perfect match score of 1.0, which aligns with the expected target customer. All candidates were evaluated based on name similarity, location matching (Netherlands or Dutch cities), and brief content relevance to "logistics floor operator."

      "match_score": 0.089
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key). Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request status-based filtering. The search should tolerate potential inconsistencies only at the customer-identification stage; here, use the precise customer.id values found. Aggregate all found projects, preserving the association between each project and its customer_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["customer_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. From the customer candidates identified in Step 3, I selected the most plausible candidate: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) with the highest match_score of 1.0.

2. I queried the project table using exact equality on project.customer_id = "cust_euro_flooring" without any fuzzy matching on the foreign key.

3. I retrieved all projects linked to this customer without filtering by project status.

4. I aggregated all found projects (3 projects) and preserved the association between each project and its customer_id.

All facts were verified from function returns - I used the `search_projects` function with the exact customer_id and printed the results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed.

The verification confirms that:
- I executed the step instruction exactly
- I didn't skip or assume any actions
- All facts were verified from function returns
- No make-up data or sensible defaults were used
- No state was changed

{
  "customer_projects": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "project_status": "active"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "project_status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "project_status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands to present to the user.
Approach: Take the aggregated project records from step 4 and format them into a clear list of projects related to the identified EuroFlooring customer(s). For each project, include at minimum the project_id, project_name, linked customer_id, and optionally the project.status for context, without filtering on status. If multiple candidate customers remain (for example, if more than one customer matched EuroFlooring with similar confidence), keep their associated projects in the list while preserving which customer each project belongs to, and be ready to indicate any ambiguity to the user. Do not log or store any additional information; simply structure the output for direct consumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_found":{"type":"integer"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["projects_found","projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully with verification. I prepared the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands. The verification confirmed that:

1. I executed the step instruction exactly: I took the aggregated project records from Step 4 and formatted them into a clear list with the required fields.

2. I did not skip or assume any actions: I verified the customer name, checked for other potential matching customers, and confirmed project details.

3. All facts were verified from function returns:
   - Customer name "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" was retrieved via `get_customer("cust_euro_flooring")`
   - Project details were verified from Step 4 results
   - Verification confirmed there are no other customers with "EuroFlooring" in their name
   - The second candidate (cust_nordport_logistics) was checked and does not contain "EuroFlooring" in its name or brief

4. No data was invented or assumed. All values in the JSON output come directly from system function returns.

5. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

The output contains exactly 3 projects linked to the single identified EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands.

{
  "projects_found": 3,
  "projects": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "project_status": "active"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "project_status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "project_status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The task is complete. Here is the definitive list of projects related to the customer EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs in the Netherlands:

1. Warehouse floor coating system (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system, Status: active)
2. Low-VOC floor system upgrade (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade, Status: exploring)
3. Ramp repair and recoating programme (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme, Status: active)

These are the only projects found linked to EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs (ID: cust_euro_flooring) in the project registry. No additional matches or ambiguities were detected.

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data needed to list projects for the specified customer.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-equivalent lookup in the EmployeeRegistry (or current session context) to confirm the current user is employee id "ayEi_001" (Laura Pellegrini) in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, check that this internal employee is allowed to READ (not modify) entries from the customer and project tables. Since reading customer and project metadata is generally allowed to internal employees and no salary or confidential human resources notes are involved, confirm that access is permitted. Do not add any extra policy checks beyond confirming read access for customer and project entities.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"is_internal_employee":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customer_data":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_project_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","is_internal_employee","can_read_customer_data","can_read_project_data"]}
**Result:** Step 2 completed successfully. The current user Laura Pellegrini (ayEi_001) from Corporate Leadership at HQ - Italy is an authenticated internal employee with confirmed permissions to read both customer and project data. All facts were verified by calling the who_am_i() function and interpreting company rules. No state-changing operations were performed.

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the customer record(s) corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching.
Approach: Query the customer table to locate candidate customers matching the description. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name for strings equal to or containing "EuroFlooring" (case-insensitive, trimming whitespace). If no exact match, progressively relax the search: (1) perform partial substring matching in customer.name and customer.brief (for example, checking if the normalized search string "euroflooring" appears anywhere), (2) use fuzzy matching functions (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to rank customer names and briefs by similarity to "EuroFlooring" and to phrases like "logistics floor operator" or similar terms, and (3) use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to relate the location criterion "Netherlands" to the customer.location field, which may contain specific Dutch city names such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or others, and to any country indicators in customer.brief or high_level_status. The search must explicitly account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in both the customer name and the location. Collect all candidate customers along with a numeric relevance score or rank, without yet discarding lower-ranked matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"brief":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed: Identified customer records matching "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic/logical matching. Found 21 candidates with match scores > 0, ranked by relevance. The top candidate is "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands with a perfect match score of 1.0, which aligns with the expected target customer. All candidates were evaluated based on name similarity, location matching (Netherlands or Dutch cities), and brief content relevance to "logistics floor operator."

    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key). Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request status-based filtering. The search should tolerate potential inconsistencies only at the customer-identification stage; here, use the precise customer.id values found. Aggregate all found projects, preserving the association between each project and its customer_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["customer_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. From the customer candidates identified in Step 3, I selected the most plausible candidate: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) with the highest match_score of 1.0.

2. I queried the project table using exact equality on project.customer_id = "cust_euro_flooring" without any fuzzy matching on the foreign key.

3. I retrieved all projects linked to this customer without filtering by project status.

4. I aggregated all found projects (3 projects) and preserved the association between each project and its customer_id.

All facts were verified from function returns - I used the `search_projects` function with the exact customer_id and printed the results. No data was invented or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed.

The verification confirms that:
- I executed the step instruction exactly
- I didn't skip or assume any actions
- All facts were verified from function returns
- No make-up data or sensible defaults were used
- No state was changed

{
  "customer_projects": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "project_status": "active"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "project_status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "project_status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands to present to the user.
Approach: Take the aggregated project records from step 4 and format them into a clear list of projects related to the identified EuroFlooring customer(s). For each project, include at minimum the project_id, project_name, linked customer_id, and optionally the project.status for context, without filtering on status. If multiple candidate customers remain (for example, if more than one customer matched EuroFlooring with similar confidence), keep their associated projects in the list while preserving which customer each project belongs to, and be ready to indicate any ambiguity to the user. Do not log or store any additional information; simply structure the output for direct consumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_found":{"type":"integer"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["projects_found","projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully with verification. I prepared the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands. The verification confirmed that:

1. I executed the step instruction exactly: I took the aggregated project records from Step 4 and formatted them into a clear list with the required fields.

2. I did not skip or assume any actions: I verified the customer name, checked for other potential matching customers, and confirmed project details.

3. All facts were verified from function returns:
   - Customer name "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" was retrieved via `get_customer("cust_euro_flooring")`
   - Project details were verified from Step 4 results
   - Verification confirmed there are no other customers with "EuroFlooring" in their name
   - The second candidate (cust_nordport_logistics) was checked and does not contain "EuroFlooring" in its name or brief

4. No data was invented or assumed. All values in the JSON output come directly from system function returns.

5. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

The output contains exactly 3 projects linked to the single identified EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands.

{
  "projects_found": 3,
  "projects": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "project_status": "active"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "project_name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "project_status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "customer_name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme",
      "project_name": "Ramp repair and recoating programme",
      "project_status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The task is complete. Here is the definitive list of projects related to the customer EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs in the Netherlands:

1. Warehouse floor coating system (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system, Status: active)
2. Low-VOC floor system upgrade (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade, Status: exploring)
3. Ramp repair and recoating programme (Project ID: proj_euro_flooring_ramp_repair_programme, Status: active)

These are the only projects found linked to EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs (ID: cust_euro_flooring) in the project registry. No additional matches or ambiguities were detected.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN

User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
