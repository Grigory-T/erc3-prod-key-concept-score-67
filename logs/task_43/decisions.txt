DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:05:49
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed successfully according to the plan: the task has been clarified, and 'EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs' (ID: cust_euro_flooring) in the Netherlands has been identified as the relevant customer to use for further steps. There are no inconsistencies, errors, or missing capabilities. The next step in the plan (step 2) is to determine user identity and permissions; there is no reason to change or replan, and the plan remains fully executable.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:06:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have proceeded as planned with expected data and without any unexpected issues. The necessary authorizations are confirmed, and the plan is still valid. No inconsistencies, errors, or missing information have been encountered so far. The next logical action is to continue to the customer identification process as outlined for Step 3.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:11:05
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps completed so far align with the original plan, and each step has returned expected correct results without inconsistencies. We have determined the customer accurately and confirmed user permissions, and customer candidates have been extracted and ranked successfully. The next planned step—retrieving projects linked to the identified customer(s)—is still valid based on the original goal and approach. There is no new risk or missing requirement to justify replanning or aborting. Proceeding to the next step is clearly warranted.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:12:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is proceeding exactly as defined: each step produced the expected and required outputs. Steps 1-4 are completed successfully, culminating with a verified list of projects directly linked to the correct EuroFlooring customer. Step 5 simply requires formatting and presenting these results to the user as specified, without additional research or investigation. No errors, missing information, or contradictions were encountered. The next action is to continue by executing Step 5.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:16:10
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps from the original plan have been completed exactly as specified, with each step's output matching the expected results as defined in the plan. No discrepancies or missing information were identified. The final answer—the list of projects related to the customer EuroFlooring in the Netherlands—was assembled and verified entirely using authoritative data sources and within company policy. There are no remaining steps and no reasons to replan or abort.
