Step 3: Identify the customer record(s) corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching.
Approach: Query the customer table to locate candidate customers matching the description. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name for strings equal to or containing "EuroFlooring" (case-insensitive, trimming whitespace). If no exact match, progressively relax the search: (1) perform partial substring matching in customer.name and customer.brief (for example, checking if the normalized search string "euroflooring" appears anywhere), (2) use fuzzy matching functions (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to rank customer names and briefs by similarity to "EuroFlooring" and to phrases like "logistics floor operator" or similar terms, and (3) use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to relate the location criterion "Netherlands" to the customer.location field, which may contain specific Dutch city names such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or others, and to any country indicators in customer.brief or high_level_status. The search must explicitly account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in both the customer name and the location. Collect all candidate customers along with a numeric relevance score or rank, without yet discarding lower-ranked matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"brief":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
