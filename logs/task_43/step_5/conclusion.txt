Step 5 completed successfully with verification. I prepared the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands. The verification confirmed that:

1. I executed the step instruction exactly: I took the aggregated project records from Step 4 and formatted them into a clear list with the required fields.

2. I did not skip or assume any actions: I verified the customer name, checked for other potential matching customers, and confirmed project details.

3. All facts were verified from function returns:
   - Customer name "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" was retrieved via `get_customer("cust_euro_flooring")`
   - Project details were verified from Step 4 results
   - Verification confirmed there are no other customers with "EuroFlooring" in their name
   - The second candidate (cust_nordport_logistics) was checked and does not contain "EuroFlooring" in its name or brief

4. No data was invented or assumed. All values in the JSON output come directly from system function returns.

5. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

The output contains exactly 3 projects linked to the single identified EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands.
