Step 5: Prepare the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands to present to the user.
Approach: Take the aggregated project records from step 4 and format them into a clear list of projects related to the identified EuroFlooring customer(s). For each project, include at minimum the project_id, project_name, linked customer_id, and optionally the project.status for context, without filtering on status. If multiple candidate customers remain (for example, if more than one customer matched EuroFlooring with similar confidence), keep their associated projects in the list while preserving which customer each project belongs to, and be ready to indicate any ambiguity to the user. Do not log or store any additional information; simply structure the output for direct consumption.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_found":{"type":"integer"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["projects_found","projects"]}
