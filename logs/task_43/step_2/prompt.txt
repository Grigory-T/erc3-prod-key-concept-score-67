Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data needed to list projects for the specified customer.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-equivalent lookup in the EmployeeRegistry (or current session context) to confirm the current user is employee id "ayEi_001" (Laura Pellegrini) in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, check that this internal employee is allowed to READ (not modify) entries from the customer and project tables. Since reading customer and project metadata is generally allowed to internal employees and no salary or confidential human resources notes are involved, confirm that access is permitted. Do not add any extra policy checks beyond confirming read access for customer and project entities.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"is_internal_employee":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customer_data":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_project_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","is_internal_employee","can_read_customer_data","can_read_project_data"]}
