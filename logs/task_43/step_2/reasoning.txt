We are in Step 2 of the overall task.
 The step description: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data.

 Approach:
 1. Use `who_ami` to get current user context.
 2. From the context, note the user id (employee_id), department, and location.
 3. According to company rules, reading customer and project data is generally allowed for internal employees.
    However, we must check if the user is internal (not public) and then confirm that they are allowed to read.
    The rules do not explicitly require a special role for reading customer and project data (only for writing).
    But we should check the authenticated user rules and general rules.

 Let's look at the rules provided:

 Authenticated User Rules:
   - There are rules for mutating (CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, etc.) which require roles like SalesUser, etc.
   - For reading, there's no explicit rule that says internal employees cannot read. However, there is a rule:
        "IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data ... DENY"
        This is about wiki, not customer/project.

   - Also, the General Rules say: "ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles ..."
        But reading customer and project data is not restricted in the provided rules.

   - The rule for EmployeeProfile: allows reading only certain fields for all employees, and restricted fields require HRAdmin or manager.

   - For customer and project, there are no read restrictions specified, so we assume that internal employees can read.

 4. However, note that the user is in Corporate Leadership. This is a high-level department, so they likely have broad read access.

 5. We are to output:
      employee_id, is_internal_employee (i.e., not public), can_read_customer_data, can_read_project_data.

 6. Since the user is authenticated (is_public is False) and there are no rules that deny read access for internal employees to customer and project data, we can set both to True.

 7. But to be thorough, let's check the context from who_am_i.

 Let's execute the code to get the current user context.

We need to execute Step 2 exactly as described.
 Step 2: Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data.
 Approach:
   - Use who_am_i() to get current user context.
   - Confirm the employee id, department, location, and that they are internal (is_public=False).
   - Based on company rules, check that internal employees are allowed to READ customer and project data.
   - We are only reading, not modifying. The user is in Corporate Leadership, which likely has broad read access.
   - According to company rules, reading customer and project data is generally allowed for internal employees.
   - We are not accessing salary or confidential HR notes, so no special restrictions apply.
   - Therefore, we can set can_read_customer_data and can_read_project_data to true.

 However, we must verify by checking the current user context and then reason about permissions based on company rules.

 Let's execute the who_am_i() function and print the result to verify.

We have executed the step exactly as instructed:
- We used who_am_i() to get the current user context.
- We verified that the user is an internal employee (is_public is False).
- Based on company rules, internal employees are allowed to read customer and project data (since no salary or confidential HR notes are involved in this read operation).

All values in the JSON output are explicitly derived from the function returns and the logical checks based on company rules.

Now, we can provide the final answer and JSON.
