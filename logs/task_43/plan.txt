Steps:
  1. Clarify the task objectives and identify required data entities to list all projects related to the customer described as the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands.
     Approach: Interpret the request literally as: find a customer whose business identity matches the name "EuroFlooring" (which may be part of a longer legal name) and which operates in or is located in the Netherlands, then list all projects whose project.customer_id links to that customer. Explicitly note that the term "EuroFlooring" and the phrase "in the Netherlands" may include typos, abbreviations, or indirect references, so all subsequent searches for this customer must use FUZZY, PARTIAL, and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching (for example, matching Netherlands to Dutch cities like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, and matching descriptions such as "logistics floor operator" in the customer brief). Identify that we will use the customer and project tables as the authoritative sources and that the final goal is a list of related project records.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"task_understood":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_reference":{"type":"string"},"location_reference":{"type":"string"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["task_understood","customer_reference","location_reference"]}
  2. Determine the current user identity and verify permissions to read customer and project data needed to list projects for the specified customer.
     Approach: Use a who_am_i-equivalent lookup in the EmployeeRegistry (or current session context) to confirm the current user is employee id "ayEi_001" (Laura Pellegrini) in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy. Based on company rules, check that this internal employee is allowed to READ (not modify) entries from the customer and project tables. Since reading customer and project metadata is generally allowed to internal employees and no salary or confidential human resources notes are involved, confirm that access is permitted. Do not add any extra policy checks beyond confirming read access for customer and project entities.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"is_internal_employee":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_customer_data":{"type":"boolean"},"can_read_project_data":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_id","is_internal_employee","can_read_customer_data","can_read_project_data"]}
  3. Identify the customer record(s) corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands using fuzzy, partial, and semantic / logical matching.
     Approach: Query the customer table to locate candidate customers matching the description. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name for strings equal to or containing "EuroFlooring" (case-insensitive, trimming whitespace). If no exact match, progressively relax the search: (1) perform partial substring matching in customer.name and customer.brief (for example, checking if the normalized search string "euroflooring" appears anywhere), (2) use fuzzy matching functions (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to rank customer names and briefs by similarity to "EuroFlooring" and to phrases like "logistics floor operator" or similar terms, and (3) use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to relate the location criterion "Netherlands" to the customer.location field, which may contain specific Dutch city names such as Amsterdam, Rotterdam, or others, and to any country indicators in customer.brief or high_level_status. The search must explicitly account for possible misspellings, abbreviations, or variations in both the customer name and the location. Collect all candidate customers along with a numeric relevance score or rank, without yet discarding lower-ranked matches.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"brief":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["candidates"]}
  4. Retrieve all projects from the project table that are directly linked to the identified EuroFlooring customer record(s) via project.customer_id.
     Approach: From the customer candidates identified in step 3, select those that most plausibly correspond to "EuroFlooring" as a logistics floor operator in the Netherlands (for example, the highest match_score or all candidates above a practical threshold), without inventing additional business rules. For each selected customer.id, query the project table for rows where project.customer_id equals that id using exact equality (no fuzzy matching on the foreign key). Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request status-based filtering. The search should tolerate potential inconsistencies only at the customer-identification stage; here, use the precise customer.id values found. Aggregate all found projects, preserving the association between each project and its customer_id.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["customer_projects"]}
  5. Prepare the final list of projects related to the EuroFlooring customer in the Netherlands to present to the user.
     Approach: Take the aggregated project records from step 4 and format them into a clear list of projects related to the identified EuroFlooring customer(s). For each project, include at minimum the project_id, project_name, linked customer_id, and optionally the project.status for context, without filtering on status. If multiple candidate customers remain (for example, if more than one customer matched EuroFlooring with similar confidence), keep their associated projects in the list while preserving which customer each project belongs to, and be ready to indicate any ambiguity to the user. Do not log or store any additional information; simply structure the output for direct consumption.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_found":{"type":"integer"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"project_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","project_id","project_name"]}}},"required":["projects_found","projects"]}
