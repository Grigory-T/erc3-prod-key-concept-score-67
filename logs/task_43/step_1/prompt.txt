Step 1: Clarify the task objectives and identify required data entities to list all projects related to the customer described as the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands.
Approach: Interpret the request literally as: find a customer whose business identity matches the name "EuroFlooring" (which may be part of a longer legal name) and which operates in or is located in the Netherlands, then list all projects whose project.customer_id links to that customer. Explicitly note that the term "EuroFlooring" and the phrase "in the Netherlands" may include typos, abbreviations, or indirect references, so all subsequent searches for this customer must use FUZZY, PARTIAL, and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching (for example, matching Netherlands to Dutch cities like Amsterdam or Rotterdam, and matching descriptions such as "logistics floor operator" in the customer brief). Identify that we will use the customer and project tables as the authoritative sources and that the final goal is a list of related project records.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"task_understood":{"type":"boolean"},"customer_reference":{"type":"string"},"location_reference":{"type":"string"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["task_understood","customer_reference","location_reference"]}
