# Current Context
Date: 2025-11-14
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001
User details: {"id": "QR23_001", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Antonio Esposito, id QR23_001) and retrieve his bound identity details (employee_id, name, department, location, system_roles) using a who_am_i or equivalent identity service.
Approach: Call the identity or EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i or equivalent) to fetch the current session user details. Ensure the result is bound to employee_id QR23_001 and includes department 'Corporate Leadership' and location 'HQ – Italy'. Also retrieve system_roles (for example 'ExecutiveLeadership', 'SalesManager', etc.) to be used later for permission checks. Do not perform any other actions in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction as requested. I called the `who_am_i()` function to get the current session user details and verified the employee's identity. I then used `get_employee()` to retrieve the full employee details.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Employee ID: "QR23_001" (from `who_am_i().current_user`)
- Name: "Antonio Esposito" (from `get_employee().name`)
- Department: "Corporate Leadership" (from `who_am_i().department` and verified in `get_employee().department`)
- Location: "HQ – Italy" (from `who_am_i().location` and verified in `get_employee().location`)

However, I could not retrieve `system_roles` because:
1. The `who_am_i()` function does not return a `system_roles` field (verified by checking all attributes)
2. The `get_employee()` function does not return a `system_roles` field in the EmployeeFull object (verified by checking all attributes)
3. No other available functions provide access to system roles

I attempted to search for role information in the wiki and employee notes, but found no explicit system role mapping for individual users. The verification checklist requires that I only include values explicitly printed/verified from function returns, and since no function returns system roles, I cannot include any values for this field.

I have not changed any object states - I only performed read operations. I have not used any made-up data or sensible defaults.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_001",
  "name": "Antonio Esposito",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Verify that the current user (QR23_001) has permission to read customer data, including the account_manager field, in the CRM system.
Approach: Using the identity data from Step 1 (especially system_roles and department), check against the company access control rules whether this user can READ records from the CRM 'customer' table. Reading customer and employee basic data is generally allowed for internal users unless explicitly restricted; confirm that there is no policy denying Antonio Esposito this read access. This step must not query any customer records yet; it only determines if reading CRM customer.account_manager is permitted. If the permission check fails, mark can_read_crm as false and the later execution should stop with a denied_security outcome.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_read_crm":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_read_crm","reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I verified the current user's permission to read customer data in the CRM system without querying any customer records.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()`
   - Retrieved employee details using `get_employee()`
   - Searched wiki for access control policies using `search_wiki()`
   - Analyzed company rules provided in the prompt
   - Did not query any customer records as instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="QR23_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
   - `get_employee()` returned: name="Antonio Esposito", notes="No notes"
   - `search_wiki()` returned no results for access control policies (empty list)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All conclusions are based on explicit function returns and the provided company rules.

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations were executed.

6. **Permission analysis based on verified facts**:
   - User is authenticated (is_public=False)
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department
   - Company rules state: "Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records"
   - No explicit restrictions found in employee notes or wiki
   - No rule denies CRM read access for internal users in leadership positions

The permission check passes because the user is an authenticated internal employee in a leadership department, and no restrictions were found that would deny read access to CRM data including the account_manager field.

{
  "can_read_crm": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated internal employee in Corporate Leadership department. Company rules indicate that roles may read CRM where allowed, and there are no explicit restrictions for leadership roles on reading customer data including account_manager field."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the customer record corresponding to the Italian automotive stamping customer 'CentraleAuto Stamping' in the CRM 'customer' table.
Approach: Query the CRM 'customer' table to search for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'CentraleAuto Stamping'. If not found, relax the search: normalize strings to lowercase and trim whitespace, then check whether 'centraleauto stamping' is contained in customer.name or customer.brief using a case-insensitive substring check. If still not found or if results are ambiguous, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching: use fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance, fuzzy_compare, or fuzzy_find_in_text) on customer.name and customer.brief, considering possible typos, spacing differences, or variants like 'Centrale Auto Stamping', 'CentraleAuto Stampings', etc. Also take into account semantic hints such as the customer being in Italy (customer.location referring to an Italian city or 'Milan', 'Turin', etc.) and automotive stamping context in the brief field. If multiple customers match with similar scores, mark the result as ambiguous and list all plausible candidates with their match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"brief":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 verification. The search successfully located the target customer "CentraleAuto Stamping" with a very close match to "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (fuzzy ratio 0.977). 

**Detailed verification of all actions:**

1. **Exact match**: `search_customers(query="CentraleAuto Stamping")` returned 0 results
2. **Case-insensitive substring search**: Searched all 21 customers for "centraleauto stamping" in name or brief - none found
3. **Fuzzy matching**: `fuzzy_compare([target_lower], customer_names, top_n=10)` returned:
   - "Centrale-Auto Stamping" with ratio 0.977 (very high match)
   - "Machina Press Systems" with ratio 0.286 (low match)
4. **Semantic/logical search**: Found 2 Italian automotive-related customers
5. **Customer details verification**:
   - Customer 1: ID="cust_centraleauto_stamping", Name="Centrale-Auto Stamping", Location="Italy", Brief="Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets."
   - Customer 2: ID="cust_machina_press", Name="Machina Press Systems", Location="Italy", Brief="OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors."

**Match scores adjusted based on actual fuzzy ratios:**
- "Centrale-Auto Stamping": 0.977 (direct from fuzzy_compare function return)
- "Machina Press Systems": 0.286 (direct from fuzzy_compare function return)

The customer "Centrale-Auto Stamping" is clearly the target based on:
- Very high fuzzy match (0.977)
- Customer ID contains "centraleauto_stamping"
- Brief explicitly mentions "Automotive stamping plant"
- Location is Italy

However, since we found 2 Italian automotive-related customers, the result is ambiguous requiring further verification in the next step.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

{
  "found": true,
  "ambiguous": true,
  "candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_centraleauto_stamping",
      "name": "Centrale-Auto Stamping",
      "location": "Italy",
      "brief": "Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets.",
      "match_score": 0.977
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "name": "Machina Press Systems",
      "location": "Italy",
      "brief": "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors.",
      "match_score": 0.286
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: For the uniquely identified customer record for 'CentraleAuto Stamping', retrieve the account_manager employee identifier from the CRM.
Approach: From Step 3, if found is true and ambiguous is false, take the single matching customer_id. Query the CRM 'customer' table for that customer_id and read the account_manager field, which references employee.id. Do not yet resolve this to employee details; just retrieve the foreign key value. If no single unambiguous match exists, this step should reflect that no account_manager can be reliably determined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["found","customer_id","account_manager_employee_id"]}
**Result:** I have re-evaluated Step 4 based on additional verification. After performing a comprehensive search:

1. **No exact match** was found for "CentraleAuto Stamping" (without dash).
2. **Only one close match** was found containing both 'centrale' and 'stamping' in the name: "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (ID: cust_centraleauto_stamping).
3. **Fuzzy search** confirmed only one high-ratio match (0.977) above the 0.95 threshold.
4. **Semantic analysis** confirms this is an Italian automotive stamping customer based on location (Italy) and brief ("Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets.").

The customer "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (with a dash) is clearly the intended target based on:
- Very high fuzzy similarity (0.977) to the target name
- Customer ID contains "centraleauto_stamping"
- Location in Italy
- Brief explicitly mentions automotive stamping
- Only one customer matches these criteria

Although Step 3 marked the result as ambiguous due to two candidates, the second candidate (Machina Press Systems) has a very low fuzzy score (0.286) and its brief describes it as an "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors" - not an automotive stamping customer. Therefore, "Centrale-Auto Stamping" is the unambiguous match.

I retrieved the account_manager field from the CRM for this customer: QR23_009.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations to verify customer details and retrieve the account_manager employee ID.

{
  "customer_id": "cust_centraleauto_stamping",
  "account_manager_employee_id": "QR23_009",
  "found": true
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Resolve the account_manager employee identifier to the corresponding employee's basic profile (name, email, location, department) from the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Using the account_manager_employee_id from Step 4, query the 'employee' table in the EmployeeRegistry by exact match on employee.id. Do not access or return restricted fields such as salary or confidential notes. Retrieve only the allowed fields: name, email, location, and department. If the employee_id is null or no such employee exists, indicate found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"name":{"type":["string","null"]},"email":{"type":["string","null"]},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","employee_id","name","email","location","department"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. The account manager employee identifier QR23_009 was resolved to Marta Sorrentino's basic profile. All required fields (name, email, location, department) were retrieved from the EmployeeRegistry using exact match on employee.id. No restricted fields were accessed. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "found": true,
  "employee_id": "QR23_009",
  "name": "Marta Sorrentino",
  "email": "QR23_009@bellini.internal",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
}

### Final Result
The account manager for the Italian automotive stamping customer CentraleAuto Stamping is Marta Sorrentino (email: QR23_009@bellini.internal), located at HQ – Italy, in the Sales & Customer Success department.

## Original Task
Who is the account manager for Italian automotive stamping customer CentraleAuto Stamping?

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Antonio Esposito, id QR23_001) and retrieve his bound identity details (employee_id, name, department, location, system_roles) using a who_am_i or equivalent identity service.
Approach: Call the identity or EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i or equivalent) to fetch the current session user details. Ensure the result is bound to employee_id QR23_001 and includes department 'Corporate Leadership' and location 'HQ – Italy'. Also retrieve system_roles (for example 'ExecutiveLeadership', 'SalesManager', etc.) to be used later for permission checks. Do not perform any other actions in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction as requested. I called the `who_am_i()` function to get the current session user details and verified the employee's identity. I then used `get_employee()` to retrieve the full employee details.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Employee ID: "QR23_001" (from `who_am_i().current_user`)
- Name: "Antonio Esposito" (from `get_employee().name`)
- Department: "Corporate Leadership" (from `who_am_i().department` and verified in `get_employee().department`)
- Location: "HQ – Italy" (from `who_am_i().location` and verified in `get_employee().location`)

However, I could not retrieve `system_roles` because:
1. The `who_am_i()` function does not return a `system_roles` field (verified by checking all attributes)
2. The `get_employee()` function does not return a `system_roles` field in the EmployeeFull object (verified by checking all attributes)
3. No other available functions provide access to system roles

I attempted to search for role information in the wiki and employee notes, but found no explicit system role mapping for individual users. The verification checklist requires that I only include values explicitly printed/verified from function returns, and since no function returns system roles, I cannot include any values for this field.

I have not changed any object states - I only performed read operations. I have not used any made-up data or sensible defaults.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_001",
  "name": "Antonio Esposito",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Verify that the current user (QR23_001) has permission to read customer data, including the account_manager field, in the CRM system.
Approach: Using the identity data from Step 1 (especially system_roles and department), check against the company access control rules whether this user can READ records from the CRM 'customer' table. Reading customer and employee basic data is generally allowed for internal users unless explicitly restricted; confirm that there is no policy denying Antonio Esposito this read access. This step must not query any customer records yet; it only determines if reading CRM customer.account_manager is permitted. If the permission check fails, mark can_read_crm as false and the later execution should stop with a denied_security outcome.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_read_crm":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_read_crm","reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I verified the current user's permission to read customer data in the CRM system without querying any customer records.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()`
   - Retrieved employee details using `get_employee()`
   - Searched wiki for access control policies using `search_wiki()`
   - Analyzed company rules provided in the prompt
   - Did not query any customer records as instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="QR23_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
   - `get_employee()` returned: name="Antonio Esposito", notes="No notes"
   - `search_wiki()` returned no results for access control policies (empty list)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All conclusions are based on explicit function returns and the provided company rules.

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations were executed.

6. **Permission analysis based on verified facts**:
   - User is authenticated (is_public=False)
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department
   - Company rules state: "Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records"
   - No explicit restrictions found in employee notes or wiki
   - No rule denies CRM read access for internal users in leadership positions

The permission check passes because the user is an authenticated internal employee in a leadership department, and no restrictions were found that would deny read access to CRM data including the account_manager field.

{
  "can_read_crm": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated internal employee in Corporate Leadership department. Company rules indicate that roles may read CRM where allowed, and there are no explicit restrictions for leadership roles on reading customer data including account_manager field."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the customer record corresponding to the Italian automotive stamping customer 'CentraleAuto Stamping' in the CRM 'customer' table.
Approach: Query the CRM 'customer' table to search for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'CentraleAuto Stamping'. If not found, relax the search: normalize strings to lowercase and trim whitespace, then check whether 'centraleauto stamping' is contained in customer.name or customer.brief using a case-insensitive substring check. If still not found or if results are ambiguous, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching: use fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance, fuzzy_compare, or fuzzy_find_in_text) on customer.name and customer.brief, considering possible typos, spacing differences, or variants like 'Centrale Auto Stamping', 'CentraleAuto Stampings', etc. Also take into account semantic hints such as the customer being in Italy (customer.location referring to an Italian city or 'Milan', 'Turin', etc.) and automotive stamping context in the brief field. If multiple customers match with similar scores, mark the result as ambiguous and list all plausible candidates with their match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"brief":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidates"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 verification. The search successfully located the target customer "CentraleAuto Stamping" with a very close match to "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (fuzzy ratio 0.977). 

**Detailed verification of all actions:**

1. **Exact match**: `search_customers(query="CentraleAuto Stamping")` returned 0 results
2. **Case-insensitive substring search**: Searched all 21 customers for "centraleauto stamping" in name or brief - none found
3. **Fuzzy matching**: `fuzzy_compare([target_lower], customer_names, top_n=10)` returned:
   - "Centrale-Auto Stamping" with ratio 0.977 (very high match)
   - "Machina Press Systems" with ratio 0.286 (low match)
4. **Semantic/logical search**: Found 2 Italian automotive-related customers
5. **Customer details verification**:
   - Customer 1: ID="cust_centraleauto_stamping", Name="Centrale-Auto Stamping", Location="Italy", Brief="Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets."
   - Customer 2: ID="cust_machina_press", Name="Machina Press Systems", Location="Italy", Brief="OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors."

**Match scores adjusted based on actual fuzzy ratios:**
- "Centrale-Auto Stamping": 0.977 (direct from fuzzy_compare function return)
- "Machina Press Systems": 0.286 (direct from fuzzy_compare function return)

The customer "Centrale-Auto Stamping" is clearly the target based on:
- Very high fuzzy match (0.977)
- Customer ID contains "centraleauto_stamping"
- Brief explicitly mentions "Automotive stamping plant"
- Location is Italy

However, since we found 2 Italian automotive-related customers, the result is ambiguous requiring further verification in the next step.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.

      "brief": "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors.",

}

### Step 4
Step 4: For the uniquely identified customer record for 'CentraleAuto Stamping', retrieve the account_manager employee identifier from the CRM.
Approach: From Step 3, if found is true and ambiguous is false, take the single matching customer_id. Query the CRM 'customer' table for that customer_id and read the account_manager field, which references employee.id. Do not yet resolve this to employee details; just retrieve the foreign key value. If no single unambiguous match exists, this step should reflect that no account_manager can be reliably determined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["found","customer_id","account_manager_employee_id"]}
**Result:** I have re-evaluated Step 4 based on additional verification. After performing a comprehensive search:

1. **No exact match** was found for "CentraleAuto Stamping" (without dash).
2. **Only one close match** was found containing both 'centrale' and 'stamping' in the name: "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (ID: cust_centraleauto_stamping).
3. **Fuzzy search** confirmed only one high-ratio match (0.977) above the 0.95 threshold.
4. **Semantic analysis** confirms this is an Italian automotive stamping customer based on location (Italy) and brief ("Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets.").

The customer "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (with a dash) is clearly the intended target based on:
- Very high fuzzy similarity (0.977) to the target name
- Customer ID contains "centraleauto_stamping"
- Location in Italy
- Brief explicitly mentions automotive stamping
- Only one customer matches these criteria

Although Step 3 marked the result as ambiguous due to two candidates, the second candidate (Machina Press Systems) has a very low fuzzy score (0.286) and its brief describes it as an "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors" - not an automotive stamping customer. Therefore, "Centrale-Auto Stamping" is the unambiguous match.

I retrieved the account_manager field from the CRM for this customer: QR23_009.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations to verify customer details and retrieve the account_manager employee ID.

{
  "customer_id": "cust_centraleauto_stamping",
  "account_manager_employee_id": "QR23_009",
  "found": true
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Resolve the account_manager employee identifier to the corresponding employee's basic profile (name, email, location, department) from the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Using the account_manager_employee_id from Step 4, query the 'employee' table in the EmployeeRegistry by exact match on employee.id. Do not access or return restricted fields such as salary or confidential notes. Retrieve only the allowed fields: name, email, location, and department. If the employee_id is null or no such employee exists, indicate found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"name":{"type":["string","null"]},"email":{"type":["string","null"]},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","employee_id","name","email","location","department"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. The account manager employee identifier QR23_009 was resolved to Marta Sorrentino's basic profile. All required fields (name, email, location, department) were retrieved from the EmployeeRegistry using exact match on employee.id. No restricted fields were accessed. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "found": true,
  "employee_id": "QR23_009",
  "name": "Marta Sorrentino",
  "email": "QR23_009@bellini.internal",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
}

### Final Result
The account manager for the Italian automotive stamping customer CentraleAuto Stamping is Marta Sorrentino (email: QR23_009@bellini.internal), located at HQ – Italy, in the Sales & Customer Success department.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN

  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;

  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-11-14
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
