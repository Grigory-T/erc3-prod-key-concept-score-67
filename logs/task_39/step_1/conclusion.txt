STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

I have executed the step instruction as requested. I called the `who_am_i()` function to get the current session user details and verified the employee's identity. I then used `get_employee()` to retrieve the full employee details.

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns:
- Employee ID: "QR23_001" (from `who_am_i().current_user`)
- Name: "Antonio Esposito" (from `get_employee().name`)
- Department: "Corporate Leadership" (from `who_am_i().department` and verified in `get_employee().department`)
- Location: "HQ – Italy" (from `who_am_i().location` and verified in `get_employee().location`)

However, I could not retrieve `system_roles` because:
1. The `who_am_i()` function does not return a `system_roles` field (verified by checking all attributes)
2. The `get_employee()` function does not return a `system_roles` field in the EmployeeFull object (verified by checking all attributes)
3. No other available functions provide access to system roles

I attempted to search for role information in the wiki and employee notes, but found no explicit system role mapping for individual users. The verification checklist requires that I only include values explicitly printed/verified from function returns, and since no function returns system roles, I cannot include any values for this field.

I have not changed any object states - I only performed read operations. I have not used any made-up data or sensible defaults.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_001",
  "name": "Antonio Esposito",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
