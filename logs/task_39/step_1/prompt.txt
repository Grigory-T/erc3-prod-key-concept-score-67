Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Antonio Esposito, id QR23_001) and retrieve his bound identity details (employee_id, name, department, location, system_roles) using a who_am_i or equivalent identity service.
Approach: Call the identity or EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i or equivalent) to fetch the current session user details. Ensure the result is bound to employee_id QR23_001 and includes department 'Corporate Leadership' and location 'HQ – Italy'. Also retrieve system_roles (for example 'ExecutiveLeadership', 'SalesManager', etc.) to be used later for permission checks. Do not perform any other actions in this step.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
