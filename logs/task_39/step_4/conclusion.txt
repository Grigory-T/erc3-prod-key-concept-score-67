I have re-evaluated Step 4 based on additional verification. After performing a comprehensive search:

1. **No exact match** was found for "CentraleAuto Stamping" (without dash).
2. **Only one close match** was found containing both 'centrale' and 'stamping' in the name: "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (ID: cust_centraleauto_stamping).
3. **Fuzzy search** confirmed only one high-ratio match (0.977) above the 0.95 threshold.
4. **Semantic analysis** confirms this is an Italian automotive stamping customer based on location (Italy) and brief ("Automotive stamping plant focused on chassis and suspension brackets.").

The customer "Centrale-Auto Stamping" (with a dash) is clearly the intended target based on:
- Very high fuzzy similarity (0.977) to the target name
- Customer ID contains "centraleauto_stamping"
- Location in Italy
- Brief explicitly mentions automotive stamping
- Only one customer matches these criteria

Although Step 3 marked the result as ambiguous due to two candidates, the second candidate (Machina Press Systems) has a very low fuzzy score (0.286) and its brief describes it as an "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors" - not an automotive stamping customer. Therefore, "Centrale-Auto Stamping" is the unambiguous match.

I retrieved the account_manager field from the CRM for this customer: QR23_009.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations to verify customer details and retrieve the account_manager employee ID.

{
  "customer_id": "cust_centraleauto_stamping",
  "account_manager_employee_id": "QR23_009",
  "found": true
}
