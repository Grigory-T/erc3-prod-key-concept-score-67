Step 4: For the uniquely identified customer record for 'CentraleAuto Stamping', retrieve the account_manager employee identifier from the CRM.
Approach: From Step 3, if found is true and ambiguous is false, take the single matching customer_id. Query the CRM 'customer' table for that customer_id and read the account_manager field, which references employee.id. Do not yet resolve this to employee details; just retrieve the foreign key value. If no single unambiguous match exists, this step should reflect that no account_manager can be reliably determined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["found","customer_id","account_manager_employee_id"]}
