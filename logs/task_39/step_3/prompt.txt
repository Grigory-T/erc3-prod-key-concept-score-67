Step 3: Locate the customer record corresponding to the Italian automotive stamping customer 'CentraleAuto Stamping' in the CRM 'customer' table.
Approach: Query the CRM 'customer' table to search for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'CentraleAuto Stamping'. If not found, relax the search: normalize strings to lowercase and trim whitespace, then check whether 'centraleauto stamping' is contained in customer.name or customer.brief using a case-insensitive substring check. If still not found or if results are ambiguous, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL searching: use fuzzy matching (e.g., Levenshtein distance, fuzzy_compare, or fuzzy_find_in_text) on customer.name and customer.brief, considering possible typos, spacing differences, or variants like 'Centrale Auto Stamping', 'CentraleAuto Stampings', etc. Also take into account semantic hints such as the customer being in Italy (customer.location referring to an Italian city or 'Milan', 'Turin', etc.) and automotive stamping context in the brief field. If multiple customers match with similar scores, mark the result as ambiguous and list all plausible candidates with their match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguous":{"type":"boolean"},"candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"brief":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["customer_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["found","ambiguous","candidates"]}
