================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:06:52

I have executed Step 2 exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I verified the current user's permission to read customer data in the CRM system without querying any customer records.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()`
   - Retrieved employee details using `get_employee()`
   - Searched wiki for access control policies using `search_wiki()`
   - Analyzed company rules provided in the prompt
   - Did not query any customer records as instructed

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="QR23_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
   - `get_employee()` returned: name="Antonio Esposito", notes="No notes"
   - `search_wiki()` returned no results for access control policies (empty list)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All conclusions are based on explicit function returns and the provided company rules.

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations were executed.

6. **Permission analysis based on verified facts**:
   - User is authenticated (is_public=False)
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department
   - Company rules state: "Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records"
   - No explicit restrictions found in employee notes or wiki
   - No rule denies CRM read access for internal users in leadership positions

The permission check passes because the user is an authenticated internal employee in a leadership department, and no restrictions were found that would deny read access to CRM data including the account_manager field.

{
  "can_read_crm": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated internal employee in Corporate Leadership department. Company rules indicate that roles may read CRM where allowed, and there are no explicit restrictions for leadership roles on reading customer data including account_manager field."
}
