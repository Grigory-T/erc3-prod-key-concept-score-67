Step 2: Verify that the current user (QR23_001) has permission to read customer data, including the account_manager field, in the CRM system.
Approach: Using the identity data from Step 1 (especially system_roles and department), check against the company access control rules whether this user can READ records from the CRM 'customer' table. Reading customer and employee basic data is generally allowed for internal users unless explicitly restricted; confirm that there is no policy denying Antonio Esposito this read access. This step must not query any customer records yet; it only determines if reading CRM customer.account_manager is permitted. If the permission check fails, mark can_read_crm as false and the later execution should stop with a denied_security outcome.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_read_crm":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_read_crm","reason"]}
