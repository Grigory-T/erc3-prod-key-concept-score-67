Step 5: Resolve the account_manager employee identifier to the corresponding employee's basic profile (name, email, location, department) from the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Using the account_manager_employee_id from Step 4, query the 'employee' table in the EmployeeRegistry by exact match on employee.id. Do not access or return restricted fields such as salary or confidential notes. Retrieve only the allowed fields: name, email, location, and department. If the employee_id is null or no such employee exists, indicate found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"name":{"type":["string","null"]},"email":{"type":["string","null"]},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["found","employee_id","name","email","location","department"]}
