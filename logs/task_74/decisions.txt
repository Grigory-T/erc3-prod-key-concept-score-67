DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:50:41
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed successfully and returned expected, verifiable results without any deviation or unexpected outcome. The remaining steps logically follow from the clarified meanings and data sources. There are no new risks or missing data, and the next step directly continues the original plan. Therefore, the plan remains valid and progress should continue as originally structured.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:58:15
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have fully matched the original plan: Step 1 clarified internal terminology and found all terms in authoritative sources, Step 2 mapped all necessary business concepts to concrete, confirmed internal data structures and systems. The remaining steps are feasible and sequentially depend on the current outputs. No inconsistencies, missing functions, or unexpected results have been encountered. There is no indication that the plan needs replanning, aborting, or can already be finalized. According to the original instructions, I should continue to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:03:39
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All actions taken so far have followed the Original Plan precisely. Each completed step has produced the expected, relevant, and correctly scoped results. There are no discrepancies or missing data that would require a change in plan. The next step—retrieving the list of team members for the identified project—can be executed as designed. There is no evidence that would require either aborting or replanning the workflow.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:05:26
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced expected results as per the original plan. There are no policy violations, missing functions, or unexpected results. The next step is to verify that the current user (Claudio Fabbri) has permission to view the required non-confidential employee and skill information. Policy review confirms this step is both valid and necessary, and nothing so far warrants replanning or aborting. The plan remains feasible and correct.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:09:30
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps up to Step 5 have been completed successfully and verified with explicit checks and no gaps, exactly as described in the original plan. No unexpected roadblocks or missing information have appeared: internal meanings are clarified; authoritative data sources and linkage are confirmed; the correct project for exclusion is fully defined; the direct project team is identified; and user permissions are explicitly validated according to company policy. Step 6 requires finding and ranking the best QMS expert outside of this project—which is feasible given the data and permission checks. No discrepancies or issues requiring replanning have occurred.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:17:05
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been executed as designed with outputs matching the expected results and no missing or inconsistent information. There are no steps remaining in the plan. The final output identifies the best internal expert (Marco Bianchi, skill_qms level 10, HQ Italy) and clear alternatives (notably Karel Drost and Casper Timmers, both in Rotterdam with skill_qms level 7), fully satisfying the user's requirement per the plan and company policy. No replanning or continuation is needed.
