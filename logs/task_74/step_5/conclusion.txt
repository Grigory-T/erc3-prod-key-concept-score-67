I have thoroughly verified the current user's permissions for Step 5. All actions were executed according to the step instructions:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: Called `who_am_i()` to retrieve user identity and verified permissions according to company rules.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Verified user identity: Claudio Fabbri (iv5n_139), Finance & Administration, HQ Italy
   - Tested employee data access via `list_employees()` and `get_employee()` - successful
   - Tested skill access via `search_employees()` with skill filter - successful
   - Checked for any attempted access to confidential fields (salary, HR notes) - none

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - User identity confirmed via `who_am_i()` return
   - Employee listing capability confirmed via `list_employees()` return (2 employees listed)
   - Skill viewing capability confirmed via `get_employee()` return (skills and wills accessible)
   - Skill search capability confirmed via `search_employees()` with skill filter (found 2 employees with 'skill_qms')
   - No security denials encountered during any operations

4. **No make-up data**: All facts derived from function returns:
   - `who_am_i()` returned: user_id="iv5n_139", department="Finance & Administration", location="HQ – Italy"
   - `list_employees()` returned employee briefs with name, department, location
   - `get_employee()` returned full employee details including skills and wills
   - `search_employees()` with skill filter returned employees with matching skills

5. **Confirmed permission basis**: According to company rules, authenticated users accessing via chatbot are allowed to view non-confidential employee fields: name, email, location, department, and context-relevant subset of skills and wills.

No state-changing functions were called during this verification. The user has the required permissions to proceed with finding internal experts for Quality management systems consultation.
