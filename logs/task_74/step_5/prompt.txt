Step 5: Verify that the current user (Claudio Fabbri from Finance and Administration) has permission to view non-confidential employee and skill information needed to recommend an internal expert.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity and authorization function to retrieve the current user's bound identity and system roles (already known: user.id = 'iv5n_139', department = 'Finance and Administration', location = 'HQ – Italy'). Confirm, according to the company rules, that Claudio is allowed to read non-confidential fields from the employee and employee_skill tables: name, email, location, department, and a context-relevant subset of skills and wills. Ensure that no access is requested or planned for salary or HR notes fields. If, for any reason, the policy engine indicates that Claudio cannot read employee or employee_skill data, mark the outcome as denied_security and plan to abort the task; otherwise, proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_view_employees":{"type":"boolean"},"can_view_skills":{"type":"boolean"},"denied_security":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","can_view_employees","can_view_skills","denied_security","reason"]}
