I have completed Step 1 by performing comprehensive fuzzy and semantic searches across the company wiki and internal systems to clarify the meanings and internal usage of the three terms. All facts presented were explicitly verified through function returns without any assumptions or invented data.

**Key findings verified through explicit function calls:**

1. **Benelux Floor Solutions**: Confirmed as an existing customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" (ID: cust_benelux_floor_solutions) with location in Belgium, active deal phase, and active high-level status. Found in CRM system and referenced in wiki documentation as part of the "France/Benelux" sales region managed by Regional Sales Managers.

2. **Fast-curing floor system**: Verified through a specific project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" (proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor) with description explicitly mentioning "Fast-curing industrial floor system." Also found in wiki documentation under industrial flooring and structural steel applications, particularly for warehouses.

3. **Quality management systems**: Documented in wiki as a skill "Quality management systems" at level 8 in example employee profiles. Verified that employees have the skill tag "skill_qms" in the employee skills system. No ISO 9001 documentation was found in the wiki search.

No state-changing functions were called during this verification process.
