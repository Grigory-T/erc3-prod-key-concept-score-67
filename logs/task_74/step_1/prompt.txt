Step 1: Clarify meanings and internal usage of the terms 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'fast-curing floor system', and 'Quality management systems' using company wiki or internal documentation, accounting for potential internal slang, abbreviations, and misspellings.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in the wiki_file table (and any connected internal documentation system) for the phrases 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'fast-curing floor system', 'fast curing flooring', 'QMS', 'quality management system', 'ISO 9001', 'floor coatings', 'floor systems'. Use fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic search to handle typos, pluralization, and abbreviations. From the top results, extract: (a) whether 'Benelux Floor Solutions' refers to a specific customer, business unit, or project family; (b) any documentation on fast-curing floor systems; (c) how 'Quality management systems' is described as a competency (e.g., linked to ISO standards, QA processes) and any standard skill tag names. If no relevant entries are found, record that as null values but still proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"terms":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"term":{"type":"string"},"definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"related_systems":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"standard_skill_tags":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["term","definition","related_systems","standard_skill_tags"]}}},"required":["terms"]}
