## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-15
Current actor: Authenticated user iv5n_139
User details: {"id": "iv5n_139", "name": "Claudio Fabbri", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Well, fast-curing floor system for Benelux Floor Solutions projects needs stronger capability in Quality management systems. Who would be the best internal expert outside of the project to consult?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify meanings and internal usage of the terms 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'fast-curing floor system', and 'Quality management systems' using company wiki or internal documentation, accounting for potential internal slang, abbreviations, and misspellings.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search in the wiki_file table (and any connected internal documentation system) for the phrases 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'fast-curing floor system', 'fast curing flooring', 'QMS', 'quality management system', 'ISO 9001', 'floor coatings', 'floor systems'. Use fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic search to handle typos, pluralization, and abbreviations. From the top results, extract: (a) whether 'Benelux Floor Solutions' refers to a specific customer, business unit, or project family; (b) any documentation on fast-curing floor systems; (c) how 'Quality management systems' is described as a competency (e.g., linked to ISO standards, QA processes) and any standard skill tag names. If no relevant entries are found, record that as null values but still proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"terms":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"term":{"type":"string"},"definition":{"type":["string","null"]},"related_systems":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"standard_skill_tags":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["term","definition","related_systems","standard_skill_tags"]}}},"required":["terms"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 1 by performing comprehensive fuzzy and semantic searches across the company wiki and internal systems to clarify the meanings and internal usage of the three terms. All facts presented were explicitly verified through function returns without any assumptions or invented data.

**Key findings verified through explicit function calls:**

1. **Benelux Floor Solutions**: Confirmed as an existing customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" (ID: cust_benelux_floor_solutions) with location in Belgium, active deal phase, and active high-level status. Found in CRM system and referenced in wiki documentation as part of the "France/Benelux" sales region managed by Regional Sales Managers.

2. **Fast-curing floor system**: Verified through a specific project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" (proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor) with description explicitly mentioning "Fast-curing industrial floor system." Also found in wiki documentation under industrial flooring and structural steel applications, particularly for warehouses.

3. **Quality management systems**: Documented in wiki as a skill "Quality management systems" at level 8 in example employee profiles. Verified that employees have the skill tag "skill_qms" in the employee skills system. No ISO 9001 documentation was found in the wiki search.

No state-changing functions were called during this verification process.

{
  "terms": [
    {
      "term": "Benelux Floor Solutions",
      "definition": "Customer: Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions (ID: cust_benelux_floor_solutions). Located in Belgium, deal phase: active, high level status: Active. Also referenced in organization hierarchy as part of 'France/Benelux' sales region.",
      "related_systems": ["CRM", "Project Registry", "Wiki documentation"],
      "standard_skill_tags": []
    },
    {
      "term": "fast-curing floor system",
      "definition": "Specific project exists: 'Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses' (proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor) for customer Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions. Project description: 'Fast-curing industrial floor system for cold and ambient warehouses applied by Benelux Floor Solutions.' Also referenced in wiki for industrial flooring systems for warehouses, production halls and loading areas.",
      "related_systems": ["Project Registry", "Wiki documentation"],
      "standard_skill_tags": []
    },
    {
      "term": "Quality management systems",
      "definition": "Documented as a skill in example employee profiles at level 8. Employees have skill tag 'skill_qms' in employee skills system. No specific ISO 9001 documentation found in wiki.",
      "related_systems": ["Wiki documentation", "Employee skills system"],
      "standard_skill_tags": ["Quality management systems", "skill_qms"]
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the concrete technical data sources and structures (tables or services) needed to resolve the question, focusing on projects, customers, employees, and skills.
Approach: Using the provided SQL schema and any additional internal technical documentation (if available), perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL inspection of entity names and descriptions to map the business concepts to concrete data structures: (a) map 'Benelux Floor Solutions' to the customer and/or project layer (likely customer.name or project.name/description); (b) confirm that project, customer, team_member, employee, and employee_skill tables are the authoritative sources to identify relevant projects, their members, and employees' Quality management systems related skills; (c) confirm that wiki_file is used only for documentation, not authoritative project or skill data. Document which specific tables and key fields (e.g., customer.name, project.name, project.customer_id, employee_skill.skill_name, employee_skill.level) will be queried later.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"business_concept":{"type":"string"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"key_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["business_concept","table_name","key_fields"]}}},"required":["entities"]}

Based on my examination of the actual data structures through function calls, I can now provide the concrete technical data sources and structures needed to resolve the question.

<final_answer>
I have completed Step 2 by examining the actual data structures through function calls to identify the concrete technical data sources and structures needed. All findings are based on verified function returns without assumptions.

The examination revealed:
1. **Customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions"** exists in the CRM system with ID "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
2. **Project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses"** exists in the Project Registry with ID "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor" and has 3 team members
3. **Employee data structure** includes skills and wills as lists of SkillLevel objects
4. **Wiki contains 19 files** and is used only for documentation, not authoritative data
5. **Key relationships** are established through: project.customer → customer.id, project.team → employee IDs, employee.skills → skill names/levels

The authoritative data sources for finding an internal expert are confirmed to be:
- CRM system for customer data
- Project Registry for project and team data  
- Employee Registry for employee profiles and skills
- Wiki is documentation-only (non-authoritative)

No state-changing functions were called during this examination.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical data sources and structures (tables or services) needed to resolve the question, focusing on projects, customers, employees, and skills.
Approach: Using the provided SQL schema and any additional internal technical documentation (if available), perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL inspection of entity names and descriptions to map the business concepts to concrete data structures: (a) map 'Benelux Floor Solutions' to the customer and/or project layer (likely customer.name or project.name/description); (b) confirm that project, customer, team_member, employee, and employee_skill tables are the authoritative sources to identify relevant projects, their members, and employees' Quality management systems related skills; (c) confirm that wiki_file is used only for documentation, not authoritative project or skill data. Document which specific tables and key fields (e.g., customer.name, project.name, project.customer_id, employee_skill.skill_name, employee_skill.level) will be queried later.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"business_concept":{"type":"string"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"key_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["business_concept","table_name","key_fields"]}}},"required":["entities"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
