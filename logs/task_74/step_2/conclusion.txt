I have completed Step 2 by examining the actual data structures through function calls to identify the concrete technical data sources and structures needed. All findings are based on verified function returns without assumptions.

The examination revealed:
1. **Customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions"** exists in the CRM system with ID "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
2. **Project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses"** exists in the Project Registry with ID "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor" and has 3 team members
3. **Employee data structure** includes skills and wills as lists of SkillLevel objects
4. **Wiki contains 19 files** and is used only for documentation, not authoritative data
5. **Key relationships** are established through: project.customer → customer.id, project.team → employee IDs, employee.skills → skill names/levels

The authoritative data sources for finding an internal expert are confirmed to be:
- CRM system for customer data
- Project Registry for project and team data  
- Employee Registry for employee profiles and skills
- Wiki is documentation-only (non-authoritative)

No state-changing functions were called during this examination.
