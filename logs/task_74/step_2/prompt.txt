Step 2: Identify the concrete technical data sources and structures (tables or services) needed to resolve the question, focusing on projects, customers, employees, and skills.
Approach: Using the provided SQL schema and any additional internal technical documentation (if available), perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL inspection of entity names and descriptions to map the business concepts to concrete data structures: (a) map 'Benelux Floor Solutions' to the customer and/or project layer (likely customer.name or project.name/description); (b) confirm that project, customer, team_member, employee, and employee_skill tables are the authoritative sources to identify relevant projects, their members, and employees' Quality management systems related skills; (c) confirm that wiki_file is used only for documentation, not authoritative project or skill data. Document which specific tables and key fields (e.g., customer.name, project.name, project.customer_id, employee_skill.skill_name, employee_skill.level) will be queried later.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"business_concept":{"type":"string"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"key_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["business_concept","table_name","key_fields"]}}},"required":["entities"]}
