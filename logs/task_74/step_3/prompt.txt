Step 3: Find all projects related to 'Benelux Floor Solutions' that use or are tagged with fast-curing floor systems, to establish the set of projects whose internal team members must be excluded from the expert search.
Approach: Query the customer and project tables. First, search the customer table with a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on customer.name and customer.brief for terms like 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'Benelux floors', 'Benelux flooring', accounting for misspellings, spacing, and hyphenation. If a high-confidence match (based on fuzzy score and logical context) is found, retrieve its customer.id. Then query the project table for all projects where (a) project.customer_id matches the identified customer.id, or (b) project.name or project.description FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matches 'Benelux Floor Solutions', 'fast-curing floor', 'fast curing flooring', including partial and fuzzy matches. Collect all matching project records as the Benelux Floor Solutions fast-curing floor system project set. Do not attempt to filter by project status; include idea, exploring, active, paused, and archived alike.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name","customer_id"]}}},"required":["projects"]}
