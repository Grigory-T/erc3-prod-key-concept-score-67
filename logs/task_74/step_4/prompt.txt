Step 4: Determine all employees who are currently or historically part of the identified Benelux Floor Solutions fast-curing floor system projects, so they can be excluded from the 'outside of the project' expert search.
Approach: Using the list of project_ids from the previous step, query the team_member table for all rows whose project_id is in that list. Use exact matching on project_id; if no results exist for an exact id, double-check using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search only if there are known inconsistencies in identifiers (e.g., legacy prefixes). Aggregate the distinct employee_id values from these rows into a set of 'in-project' employees. Optionally capture each employee's role and time_slice to understand their involvement level, but for exclusion purposes, simply being present as a team_member is sufficient. This set represents all employees that must not be considered as external experts for this consultation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id","employee_id","role"]}}},"required":["project_team_members"]}
