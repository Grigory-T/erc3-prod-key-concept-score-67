I have executed Step 4 according to the step instructions and checklist. Here's my verification:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I used the exact project_id "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor" from Step 3 and retrieved the project team using get_project(), which returns current team members.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I performed exact matching on project_id (as instructed)
   - I captured all current team members with their roles
   - I verified each employee exists in the employee registry
   - I did not use fuzzy/semantic search for project_id because exact matching worked

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - Project existence verified via get_project()
   - Each team member's employee_id and role extracted from project.team
   - Each employee verified via get_employee() to confirm they exist
   - Printed and verified all data from function returns

4. **No make-up data**: All data came from actual function returns.

5. **Historical team members consideration**: The get_project() function only returns current team members. There is no available function to query historical team members or the team_member table directly. Given the API limitations, I captured all current team members as the available "in-project" employees set.

6. **No state-changing functions**: Only read operations (get_project, get_employee, who_am_i) were used.

The result identifies 3 employees currently part of the Benelux Floor Solutions fast-curing floor system project who should be excluded from external expert consideration.
