I have thoroughly verified Step 6 execution against the approach checklist. Here are the key findings from verification:

1. **Skill matching verification**: 
   - All employees in the system have the skill "skill_qms" at various levels (verified via search_employees with skill filter, returning 151 employees).
   - No other QMS-related skill names were found (e.g., "Quality management system", "ISO 9001") in a sample of 30 employees.
   - The fuzzy comparison test showed low ratios between QMS terms and skill names, confirming "skill_qms" is the primary matching skill.

2. **Exclusion verification**: 
   - Successfully excluded the 3 project team members (iv5n_019, iv5n_052, iv5n_055) who are part of the Benelux floor system project.
   - Verified these excluded employees also have "skill_qms" skill but were correctly excluded.

3. **Ranking verification**:
   - Ranking criteria followed exactly: (a) highest QMS skill level, (b) number of distinct QMS skills (all had 1), (c) proximity to Benelux locations.
   - Composite scoring correctly balanced these factors with appropriate weights.
   - Location scoring: Rotterdam (Netherlands) received highest score (3), Germany/France/Austria (2), other locations (1).

4. **Data accuracy**:
   - All employee data (names, emails, locations, departments, skills) were retrieved directly from function returns.
   - No salary or HR notes were accessed, complying with company rules.
   - Primary expert Marco Bianchi has the highest QMS skill level (10) but is located in Italy.
   - Top alternatives Karel Drost and Casper Timmers have slightly lower skill levels (7) but are located in Rotterdam, Netherlands - directly in the Benelux region.

5. **Approach compliance**:
   - Used case-insensitive partial matching for skill filtering (fuzzy matching functions were tested but not needed as all relevant skills exactly match "skill_qms").
   - Considered multiple QMS-related skill terms as specified in the approach.
   - Did not filter by skill level threshold, preserving all levels as instructed.
   - Prioritized Benelux region locations in ranking.

The execution fully complies with the step instructions and approach. The primary expert is correctly identified as Marco Bianchi based on the highest QMS skill level, with strong alternatives offering better Benelux location alignment.
