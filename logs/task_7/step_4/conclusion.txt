I have executed step 4 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match query**: Used the employee_id "FphR_040" (resolved from step 2 for 'Coppola Noemi') to query the team_member table via `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` with an exact match.

2. **Retrieved project details**: Collected all project_id values and queried the project table for each using `get_project()` to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description).

3. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since exact matches on identifiers worked perfectly, no fuzzy or semantic matching was required.

4. **Verification performed**: Conducted an alternative verification by checking all 36 projects in the system and manually filtering for team membership of FphR_040. Both methods returned the same 3 projects, confirming accuracy.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Employee verification: `get_employee("FphR_040")` confirmed the employee exists as "Noemi Coppola"
- Project search: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects
- Project details: `get_project()` for each project provided the exact name, customer_id, and status as printed
- Alternative verification: Manual check of all 36 projects confirmed the same 3 projects

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the project and employee registries. The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.
