Step 4: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the resolved employee 'Coppola Noemi' is a team member.
Approach: Take the chosen employee_id for 'Coppola Noemi' from step 2. Query the team_member table for rows with an exact match on this employee_id and collect all project_id values. Then query the project table for these project_id values to get project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Use exact matches on identifiers; if any discrepancy appears (for example, due to inconsistent identifiers), resolve it via **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching between team_member.project_id and project.id, while preferring exact matches whenever possible.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
