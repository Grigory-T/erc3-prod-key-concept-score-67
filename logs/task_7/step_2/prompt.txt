Step 2: Resolve the person 'Coppola Noemi' to an internal employee record in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table for candidates whose name matches 'Coppola Noemi'. First try an exact match on the full name (case-insensitive, trimmed). If that fails or returns multiple entries, apply **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching: split into first name and last name, search for rows where both tokens appear in any order in the name field, allow for partial matches and typical misspellings, and consider alternative spacing or accents. If still ambiguous, compute a fuzzy similarity score (e.g. using fuzzy_compare) and return the top N candidates with their confidence scores, without auto-selecting when multiple candidates have similar scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}}},"required":["target_name","matches"]}
