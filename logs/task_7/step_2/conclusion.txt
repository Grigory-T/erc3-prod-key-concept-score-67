I have executed step 2 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: Searched for "Coppola Noemi" with case-insensitive, trimmed matching. No exact matches found.

2. **Token-based matching**: Split the name into tokens ["coppola", "noemi"] and searched for employees where both tokens appear in the name field in any order. Found one match: "Noemi Coppola" (ID: FphR_040).

3. **Confidence scoring**: Assigned confidence 0.8 to token-based matches (not exact but semantically correct with tokens appearing in any order).

4. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since a clear token-based match was found, fuzzy matching was not required per the approach.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Total employees: 154 (from `list_all_employees()`)
- Exact matches: 0 (verified by comparing normalized names)
- Token-based match: 1 (verified by checking both tokens appear in employee name)
- Employee details: ID, name, and email were all retrieved directly from the EmployeeBrief object

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the employee registry.
