Step 3: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (identified in step 1) is a team member; this defines 'my projects'.
Approach: Using the employee_id from step 1, query the team_member table with an exact match on employee_id. Collect all related project_id values. Then query the project table by these project_id values (using an exact match on the identifiers) to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Do not filter by project status (include idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). No fuzzy logic is needed on project_id, but if any join by name is required later, use **fuzzy**, partial, and **semantic / logical** matching as per the general search strategy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
