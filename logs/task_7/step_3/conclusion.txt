I have verified the execution of step 3 and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: Used the employee_id from step 1 ("FphR_006") to query for projects where this employee is a team member.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` function as the primary approach (which queries the team_member table with exact match on employee_id and returns project details)
   - Verified results with an alternative manual approach by checking all projects and filtering by team membership
   - Both methods returned the same 2 projects, confirming consistency

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The employee_id "FphR_006" was confirmed from step 1
   - Project details (project_id, name, customer_id, status) were printed directly from function returns
   - Both projects were confirmed to be active, but no filtering was applied (as instructed)
   - All data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed (search_projects, list_all_projects, get_project). No update functions were called.

5. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Exact matching on employee_id was sufficient, as specified in the approach.

The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.
