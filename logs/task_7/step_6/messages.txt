## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-12-15
Current actor: Authenticated user FphR_006
User details: {"id": "FphR_006", "name": "Irene Venturi", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: FphR_006
department: Sales & Customer Success
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-12-15
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** In which of my projects is Coppola Noemi involved

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user in the employee registry and retrieve their internal employee identifier and roles to know whose projects are referred to as 'my projects' (this is Irene Venturi).
Approach: Call the identity/EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i) to get the bound employee record for the current session (user id 'FphR_006'). If there is any mismatch between the session identity and the employee table (for example, difference between account id, email, and full name), resolve it by searching the employee table using a **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** search on name and email (handle possible misspellings, extra spaces, different ordering of first and last name). Prefer exact matches on technical identifiers if available, and only fall back to fuzzy matching if needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","employee_id","name"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step exactly as instructed. The current authenticated user was identified by calling who_am_i() to get the session identity, then using get_employee() with the exact user ID "FphR_006". An exact match was found in the employee registry, so no fuzzy matching was required. The employee record provided all requested fields except system_roles, which are not available through the API functions. Therefore, system_roles is returned as an empty array.

All facts were verified directly from function returns:
- user_id from who_am_i().current_user
- employee_id, name, department, location from get_employee("FphR_006")

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_006",
  "employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "name": "Irene Venturi",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Resolve the person 'Coppola Noemi' to an internal employee record in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table for candidates whose name matches 'Coppola Noemi'. First try an exact match on the full name (case-insensitive, trimmed). If that fails or returns multiple entries, apply **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching: split into first name and last name, search for rows where both tokens appear in any order in the name field, allow for partial matches and typical misspellings, and consider alternative spacing or accents. If still ambiguous, compute a fuzzy similarity score (e.g. using fuzzy_compare) and return the top N candidates with their confidence scores, without auto-selecting when multiple candidates have similar scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}}},"required":["target_name","matches"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 2 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: Searched for "Coppola Noemi" with case-insensitive, trimmed matching. No exact matches found.

2. **Token-based matching**: Split the name into tokens ["coppola", "noemi"] and searched for employees where both tokens appear in the name field in any order. Found one match: "Noemi Coppola" (ID: FphR_040).

3. **Confidence scoring**: Assigned confidence 0.8 to token-based matches (not exact but semantically correct with tokens appearing in any order).

4. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since a clear token-based match was found, fuzzy matching was not required per the approach.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Total employees: 154 (from `list_all_employees()`)
- Exact matches: 0 (verified by comparing normalized names)
- Token-based match: 1 (verified by checking both tokens appear in employee name)
- Employee details: ID, name, and email were all retrieved directly from the EmployeeBrief object

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the employee registry.

{
  "target_name": "Coppola Noemi",
  "matches": [
    {
      "employee_id": "FphR_040",
      "name": "Noemi Coppola",
      "email": "FphR_040@bellini.internal",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (identified in step 1) is a team member; this defines 'my projects'.
Approach: Using the employee_id from step 1, query the team_member table with an exact match on employee_id. Collect all related project_id values. Then query the project table by these project_id values (using an exact match on the identifiers) to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Do not filter by project status (include idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). No fuzzy logic is needed on project_id, but if any join by name is required later, use **fuzzy**, partial, and **semantic / logical** matching as per the general search strategy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of step 3 and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: Used the employee_id from step 1 ("FphR_006") to query for projects where this employee is a team member.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` function as the primary approach (which queries the team_member table with exact match on employee_id and returns project details)
   - Verified results with an alternative manual approach by checking all projects and filtering by team membership
   - Both methods returned the same 2 projects, confirming consistency

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The employee_id "FphR_006" was confirmed from step 1
   - Project details (project_id, name, customer_id, status) were printed directly from function returns
   - Both projects were confirmed to be active, but no filtering was applied (as instructed)
   - All data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed (search_projects, list_all_projects, get_project). No update functions were called.

5. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Exact matching on employee_id was sufficient, as specified in the approach.

The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
      "name": "High-build machinery primer optimisation",
      "customer_id": "cust_rhinemach_industrial",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2",
      "name": "Wall and ceiling coating phase 2",
      "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the resolved employee 'Coppola Noemi' is a team member.
Approach: Take the chosen employee_id for 'Coppola Noemi' from step 2. Query the team_member table for rows with an exact match on this employee_id and collect all project_id values. Then query the project table for these project_id values to get project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Use exact matches on identifiers; if any discrepancy appears (for example, due to inconsistent identifiers), resolve it via **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching between team_member.project_id and project.id, while preferring exact matches whenever possible.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 4 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match query**: Used the employee_id "FphR_040" (resolved from step 2 for 'Coppola Noemi') to query the team_member table via `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` with an exact match.

2. **Retrieved project details**: Collected all project_id values and queried the project table for each using `get_project()` to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description).

3. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since exact matches on identifiers worked perfectly, no fuzzy or semantic matching was required.

4. **Verification performed**: Conducted an alternative verification by checking all 36 projects in the system and manually filtering for team membership of FphR_040. Both methods returned the same 3 projects, confirming accuracy.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Employee verification: `get_employee("FphR_040")` confirmed the employee exists as "Noemi Coppola"
- Project search: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects
- Project details: `get_project()` for each project provided the exact name, customer_id, and status as printed
- Alternative verification: Manual check of all 36 projects confirmed the same 3 projects

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the project and employee registries. The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_040",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_machina_press_quick_clean",
      "name": "Quick-clean primer for machinery line",

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions to confirm that the current user is allowed to view which of their own projects involve another employee and to access project membership information.
Approach: Using the current user's identity and roles from step 1 (system_roles, department, location) and the company rules, evaluate whether reading project and team_member data for projects that the user is part of is permitted. Since the documented restrictions apply mainly to writing or mutating data (creating or updating customers, projects, time entries, skills, and accessing salary), verify that this read-only query about project participation does not violate any listed restrictions. Explicitly confirm that no salary, human resources notes, or other restricted fields are accessed. If any rule is found that would forbid this read access (for example, if a stricter internal policy exists), mark access as denied; otherwise, mark it as allowed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_view","reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 5 exactly as instructed. Let me verify my execution against the checklist:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Used the current user's identity from step 1 (Irene Venturi, FphR_006, Sales & Customer Success department, HQ – Italy location)
   - Evaluated company rules to determine if reading project and team_member data is permitted
   - Verified this is a read-only query about project participation
   - Explicitly confirmed no salary, HR notes, or restricted fields are accessed
   - Found no rule that would forbid this read access
   - Marked access as allowed since no restrictions apply

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Analyzed all relevant company rules (documented in analysis)
   - Practically tested access by reading project data (verified with `search_projects` and `get_project`)
   - Made conclusion based on explicit rules analysis

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes:
   - Current user identity: Verified from `who_am_i()` function return
   - Authentication status: Verified as True (not public)
   - Department and location: Verified from function returns
   - Project access test: Successfully accessed project data with `get_project()`
   - No state-changing operations performed
   - All data in JSON output derived from verified function returns

All facts were explicitly printed/verified from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="FphR_006", department="Sales & Customer Success", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
- `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned project data
- `get_project("proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer")` returned project with team members

No make-up data or sensible defaults used. The conclusion is based on:
1. Verified authentication status
2. Explicit company rules analysis
3. Successful practical test of reading project data
4. Absence of any rule prohibiting this specific read access

The JSON output contains only values derived from verified function returns and logical conclusions based on company rules analysis.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rule restricts reading project or team_member data for projects they are part of. This is a read-only operation that does not access sensitive fields (salary, HR notes). The user's role in Sales & Customer Success requires visibility into project membership for customer success activities."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 6: Determine in which of the current user's projects the employee 'Coppola Noemi' is involved, and prepare the final list of shared projects.
Approach: Provided that step 5 confirms access is allowed, compute the intersection between the project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 ('Coppola Noemi' projects) using exact equality on project_id. For each project_id that appears in both lists, construct a result entry including project_id, project name, status, and customer_id (if available). If 'Coppola Noemi' could not be uniquely identified in step 2, or if there are no common projects, handle this gracefully by returning an empty list of shared projects while still providing the current user's and the colleague's identifiers. If access was denied in step 5, do not include project details and instead reflect that in the output according to the permission status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"colleague_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"shared_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["current_user_employee_id","colleague_employee_id","shared_projects"]}

<final_answer>
I have executed step 6 exactly as instructed. The step involved computing the intersection between the current user's projects and Coppola Noemi's projects, then preparing the final list of shared projects.

**Process followed:**
1. Retrieved current user context (Irene Venturi, FphR_006) and colleague ID (Noemi Coppola, FphR_040) from previous steps
2. Fetched all projects for the current user using pagination (limit 5 per page as required) - found 2 projects
3. Fetched all projects for the colleague using pagination - found 3 projects
4. Computed intersection by project_id to find shared projects - found 1 shared project
5. Verified the result by checking each current user's project individually to confirm team membership
6. Prepared the final list of shared projects with required details

**Results:**
- Current user (Irene Venturi) has 2 projects
- Colleague (Noemi Coppola) has 3 projects
- They share 1 project: "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2" (Wall and ceiling coating phase 2)
- Verification confirmed that colleague is indeed a team member in this shared project

All facts were verified from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` returned current user context
- `search_projects()` with pagination returned project lists for both employees
- `get_project()` used for verification confirmed team membership
- No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations

The output contains only verified data from function returns.

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 6: Determine in which of the current user's projects the employee 'Coppola Noemi' is involved, and prepare the final list of shared projects.
Approach: Provided that step 5 confirms access is allowed, compute the intersection between the project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 ('Coppola Noemi' projects) using exact equality on project_id. For each project_id that appears in both lists, construct a result entry including project_id, project name, status, and customer_id (if available).

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have verified my execution of step 6 against the checklist and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Computed the intersection between project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 (Coppola Noemi's projects) using exact equality on project_id
   - Constructed result entries for each shared project including project_id, name, status, and customer_id
   - Provided current user and colleague identifiers
   - Step 5 confirmed access was allowed, so project details are included

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Used exact employee IDs from previous steps: "FphR_006" (current user) and "FphR_040" (colleague)
   - Fetched projects using `search_projects()` with proper pagination (limit 5)
   - Computed intersection using exact project_id matching
   - Verified results by checking team membership with `get_project()`
   - No fuzzy matching needed as all identifiers were exact

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes, all data comes from function returns:
   - Current user: `who_am_i()` returned current_user="FphR_006"
   - Colleague ID: From step 2 result: "FphR_040"
   - Current user's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned 2 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Colleague's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Shared project: Intersection found "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2"
   - Project details: Retrieved from project brief objects, all fields printed
   - Verification: `get_project("proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2")` confirmed team membership

No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations). No make-up data or sensible defaults used. All JSON values come from explicitly printed function returns.

The execution matches the expected output structure and contains all required fields.
