I have verified my execution of step 6 against the checklist and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Computed the intersection between project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 (Coppola Noemi's projects) using exact equality on project_id
   - Constructed result entries for each shared project including project_id, name, status, and customer_id
   - Provided current user and colleague identifiers
   - Step 5 confirmed access was allowed, so project details are included

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Used exact employee IDs from previous steps: "FphR_006" (current user) and "FphR_040" (colleague)
   - Fetched projects using `search_projects()` with proper pagination (limit 5)
   - Computed intersection using exact project_id matching
   - Verified results by checking team membership with `get_project()`
   - No fuzzy matching needed as all identifiers were exact

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes, all data comes from function returns:
   - Current user: `who_am_i()` returned current_user="FphR_006"
   - Colleague ID: From step 2 result: "FphR_040"
   - Current user's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned 2 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Colleague's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Shared project: Intersection found "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2"
   - Project details: Retrieved from project brief objects, all fields printed
   - Verification: `get_project("proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2")` confirmed team membership

No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations). No make-up data or sensible defaults used. All JSON values come from explicitly printed function returns.

The execution matches the expected output structure and contains all required fields.

{
  "current_user_employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "colleague_employee_id": "FphR_040",
  "shared_projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2",
      "name": "Wall and ceiling coating phase 2",
      "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}
