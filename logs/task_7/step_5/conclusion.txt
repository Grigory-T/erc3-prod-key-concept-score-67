================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 19:29:24

I have executed step 5 exactly as instructed. Let me verify my execution against the checklist:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Used the current user's identity from step 1 (Irene Venturi, FphR_006, Sales & Customer Success department, HQ – Italy location)
   - Evaluated company rules to determine if reading project and team_member data is permitted
   - Verified this is a read-only query about project participation
   - Explicitly confirmed no salary, HR notes, or restricted fields are accessed
   - Found no rule that would forbid this read access
   - Marked access as allowed since no restrictions apply

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Analyzed all relevant company rules (documented in analysis)
   - Practically tested access by reading project data (verified with `search_projects` and `get_project`)
   - Made conclusion based on explicit rules analysis

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes:
   - Current user identity: Verified from `who_am_i()` function return
   - Authentication status: Verified as True (not public)
   - Department and location: Verified from function returns
   - Project access test: Successfully accessed project data with `get_project()`
   - No state-changing operations performed
   - All data in JSON output derived from verified function returns

All facts were explicitly printed/verified from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="FphR_006", department="Sales & Customer Success", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
- `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned project data
- `get_project("proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer")` returned project with team members

No make-up data or sensible defaults used. The conclusion is based on:
1. Verified authentication status
2. Explicit company rules analysis
3. Successful practical test of reading project data
4. Absence of any rule prohibiting this specific read access

The JSON output contains only values derived from verified function returns and logical conclusions based on company rules analysis.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rule restricts reading project or team_member data for projects they are part of. This is a read-only operation that does not access sensitive fields (salary, HR notes). The user's role in Sales & Customer Success requires visibility into project membership for customer success activities."
}
