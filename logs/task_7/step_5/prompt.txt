Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions to confirm that the current user is allowed to view which of their own projects involve another employee and to access project membership information.
Approach: Using the current user's identity and roles from step 1 (system_roles, department, location) and the company rules, evaluate whether reading project and team_member data for projects that the user is part of is permitted. Since the documented restrictions apply mainly to writing or mutating data (creating or updating customers, projects, time entries, skills, and accessing salary), verify that this read-only query about project participation does not violate any listed restrictions. Explicitly confirm that no salary, human resources notes, or other restricted fields are accessed. If any rule is found that would forbid this read access (for example, if a stricter internal policy exists), mark access as denied; otherwise, mark it as allowed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_view","reason"]}
