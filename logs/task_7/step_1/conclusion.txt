I have executed the step exactly as instructed. The current authenticated user was identified by calling who_am_i() to get the session identity, then using get_employee() with the exact user ID "FphR_006". An exact match was found in the employee registry, so no fuzzy matching was required. The employee record provided all requested fields except system_roles, which are not available through the API functions. Therefore, system_roles is returned as an empty array.

All facts were verified directly from function returns:
- user_id from who_am_i().current_user
- employee_id, name, department, location from get_employee("FphR_006")

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_006",
  "employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "name": "Irene Venturi",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
