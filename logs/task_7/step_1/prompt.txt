Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user in the employee registry and retrieve their internal employee identifier and roles to know whose projects are referred to as 'my projects' (this is Irene Venturi).
Approach: Call the identity/EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i) to get the bound employee record for the current session (user id 'FphR_006'). If there is any mismatch between the session identity and the employee table (for example, difference between account id, email, and full name), resolve it by searching the employee table using a **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** search on name and email (handle possible misspellings, extra spaces, different ordering of first and last name). Prefer exact matches on technical identifiers if available, and only fall back to fuzzy matching if needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","employee_id","name"]}
