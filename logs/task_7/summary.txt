## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user in the employee registry and retrieve their internal employee identifier and roles to know whose projects are referred to as 'my projects' (this is Irene Venturi).
Approach: Call the identity/EmployeeRegistry service (who_am_i) to get the bound employee record for the current session (user id 'FphR_006'). If there is any mismatch between the session identity and the employee table (for example, difference between account id, email, and full name), resolve it by searching the employee table using a **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** search on name and email (handle possible misspellings, extra spaces, different ordering of first and last name). Prefer exact matches on technical identifiers if available, and only fall back to fuzzy matching if needed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["user_id","employee_id","name"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step exactly as instructed. The current authenticated user was identified by calling who_am_i() to get the session identity, then using get_employee() with the exact user ID "FphR_006". An exact match was found in the employee registry, so no fuzzy matching was required. The employee record provided all requested fields except system_roles, which are not available through the API functions. Therefore, system_roles is returned as an empty array.

All facts were verified directly from function returns:
- user_id from who_am_i().current_user
- employee_id, name, department, location from get_employee("FphR_006")

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_006",
  "employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "name": "Irene Venturi",
  "department": "Sales & Customer Success",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Resolve the person 'Coppola Noemi' to an internal employee record in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table for candidates whose name matches 'Coppola Noemi'. First try an exact match on the full name (case-insensitive, trimmed). If that fails or returns multiple entries, apply **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching: split into first name and last name, search for rows where both tokens appear in any order in the name field, allow for partial matches and typical misspellings, and consider alternative spacing or accents. If still ambiguous, compute a fuzzy similarity score (e.g. using fuzzy_compare) and return the top N candidates with their confidence scores, without auto-selecting when multiple candidates have similar scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","confidence"]}}},"required":["target_name","matches"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 2 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match**: Searched for "Coppola Noemi" with case-insensitive, trimmed matching. No exact matches found.

2. **Token-based matching**: Split the name into tokens ["coppola", "noemi"] and searched for employees where both tokens appear in the name field in any order. Found one match: "Noemi Coppola" (ID: FphR_040).

3. **Confidence scoring**: Assigned confidence 0.8 to token-based matches (not exact but semantically correct with tokens appearing in any order).

4. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since a clear token-based match was found, fuzzy matching was not required per the approach.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Total employees: 154 (from `list_all_employees()`)
- Exact matches: 0 (verified by comparing normalized names)
- Token-based match: 1 (verified by checking both tokens appear in employee name)
- Employee details: ID, name, and email were all retrieved directly from the EmployeeBrief object

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the employee registry.

{
  "target_name": "Coppola Noemi",
  "matches": [
    {
      "employee_id": "FphR_040",
      "name": "Noemi Coppola",
      "email": "FphR_040@bellini.internal",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (identified in step 1) is a team member; this defines 'my projects'.
Approach: Using the employee_id from step 1, query the team_member table with an exact match on employee_id. Collect all related project_id values. Then query the project table by these project_id values (using an exact match on the identifiers) to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Do not filter by project status (include idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). No fuzzy logic is needed on project_id, but if any join by name is required later, use **fuzzy**, partial, and **semantic / logical** matching as per the general search strategy.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of step 3 and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Executed the step instruction exactly**: Used the employee_id from step 1 ("FphR_006") to query for projects where this employee is a team member.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` function as the primary approach (which queries the team_member table with exact match on employee_id and returns project details)
   - Verified results with an alternative manual approach by checking all projects and filtering by team membership
   - Both methods returned the same 2 projects, confirming consistency

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The employee_id "FphR_006" was confirmed from step 1
   - Project details (project_id, name, customer_id, status) were printed directly from function returns
   - Both projects were confirmed to be active, but no filtering was applied (as instructed)
   - All data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns

4. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed (search_projects, list_all_projects, get_project). No update functions were called.

5. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Exact matching on employee_id was sufficient, as specified in the approach.

The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer",
      "name": "High-build machinery primer optimisation",
      "customer_id": "cust_rhinemach_industrial",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2",
      "name": "Wall and ceiling coating phase 2",
      "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the resolved employee 'Coppola Noemi' is a team member.
Approach: Take the chosen employee_id for 'Coppola Noemi' from step 2. Query the team_member table for rows with an exact match on this employee_id and collect all project_id values. Then query the project table for these project_id values to get project details (name, status, customer_id, description). Use exact matches on identifiers; if any discrepancy appears (for example, due to inconsistent identifiers), resolve it via **fuzzy** and **semantic / logical** matching between team_member.project_id and project.id, while preferring exact matches whenever possible.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["employee_id","projects"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 4 exactly as instructed. The process followed the specified approach:

1. **Exact match query**: Used the employee_id "FphR_040" (resolved from step 2 for 'Coppola Noemi') to query the team_member table via `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` with an exact match.

2. **Retrieved project details**: Collected all project_id values and queried the project table for each using `get_project()` to obtain project details (name, status, customer_id, description).

3. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since exact matches on identifiers worked perfectly, no fuzzy or semantic matching was required.

4. **Verification performed**: Conducted an alternative verification by checking all 36 projects in the system and manually filtering for team membership of FphR_040. Both methods returned the same 3 projects, confirming accuracy.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Employee verification: `get_employee("FphR_040")` confirmed the employee exists as "Noemi Coppola"
- Project search: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects
- Project details: `get_project()` for each project provided the exact name, customer_id, and status as printed
- Alternative verification: Manual check of all 36 projects confirmed the same 3 projects

No state-changing operations were performed, only read operations on the project and employee registries. The output contains only verified data from function returns, with no made-up or assumed values.

{
  "employee_id": "FphR_040",
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_machina_press_quick_clean",
      "name": "Quick-clean primer for machinery line",
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface",
      "name": "Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line",
      "customer_id": "cust_centraleauto_stamping",
      "status": "active"
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2",
      "name": "Wall and ceiling coating phase 2",
      "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions to confirm that the current user is allowed to view which of their own projects involve another employee and to access project membership information.
Approach: Using the current user's identity and roles from step 1 (system_roles, department, location) and the company rules, evaluate whether reading project and team_member data for projects that the user is part of is permitted. Since the documented restrictions apply mainly to writing or mutating data (creating or updating customers, projects, time entries, skills, and accessing salary), verify that this read-only query about project participation does not violate any listed restrictions. Explicitly confirm that no salary, human resources notes, or other restricted fields are accessed. If any rule is found that would forbid this read access (for example, if a stricter internal policy exists), mark access as denied; otherwise, mark it as allowed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["can_view","reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed step 5 exactly as instructed. Let me verify my execution against the checklist:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Used the current user's identity from step 1 (Irene Venturi, FphR_006, Sales & Customer Success department, HQ – Italy location)
   - Evaluated company rules to determine if reading project and team_member data is permitted
   - Verified this is a read-only query about project participation
   - Explicitly confirmed no salary, HR notes, or restricted fields are accessed
   - Found no rule that would forbid this read access
   - Marked access as allowed since no restrictions apply

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Analyzed all relevant company rules (documented in analysis)
   - Practically tested access by reading project data (verified with `search_projects` and `get_project`)
   - Made conclusion based on explicit rules analysis

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes:
   - Current user identity: Verified from `who_am_i()` function return
   - Authentication status: Verified as True (not public)
   - Department and location: Verified from function returns
   - Project access test: Successfully accessed project data with `get_project()`
   - No state-changing operations performed
   - All data in JSON output derived from verified function returns

All facts were explicitly printed/verified from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` returned: current_user="FphR_006", department="Sales & Customer Success", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False
- `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned project data
- `get_project("proj_rhinemach_machinery_primer")` returned project with team members

No make-up data or sensible defaults used. The conclusion is based on:
1. Verified authentication status
2. Explicit company rules analysis
3. Successful practical test of reading project data
4. Absence of any rule prohibiting this specific read access

The JSON output contains only values derived from verified function returns and logical conclusions based on company rules analysis.

{
  "can_view": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rule restricts reading project or team_member data for projects they are part of. This is a read-only operation that does not access sensitive fields (salary, HR notes). The user's role in Sales & Customer Success requires visibility into project membership for customer success activities."
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Determine in which of the current user's projects the employee 'Coppola Noemi' is involved, and prepare the final list of shared projects.
Approach: Provided that step 5 confirms access is allowed, compute the intersection between the project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 ('Coppola Noemi' projects) using exact equality on project_id. For each project_id that appears in both lists, construct a result entry including project_id, project name, status, and customer_id (if available). If 'Coppola Noemi' could not be uniquely identified in step 2, or if there are no common projects, handle this gracefully by returning an empty list of shared projects while still providing the current user's and the colleague's identifiers. If access was denied in step 5, do not include project details and instead reflect that in the output according to the permission status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"colleague_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"shared_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","name","status"]}}},"required":["current_user_employee_id","colleague_employee_id","shared_projects"]}
**Result:** I have verified my execution of step 6 against the checklist and confirm it was completed correctly according to the step description. Here's my verification:

1. **Did I execute the step instruction?** Yes, I:
   - Computed the intersection between project lists from step 3 (current user's projects) and step 4 (Coppola Noemi's projects) using exact equality on project_id
   - Constructed result entries for each shared project including project_id, name, status, and customer_id
   - Provided current user and colleague identifiers
   - Step 5 confirmed access was allowed, so project details are included

2. **Did I skip or assume any action?** No, I:
   - Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` (verified)
   - Used exact employee IDs from previous steps: "FphR_006" (current user) and "FphR_040" (colleague)
   - Fetched projects using `search_projects()` with proper pagination (limit 5)
   - Computed intersection using exact project_id matching
   - Verified results by checking team membership with `get_project()`
   - No fuzzy matching needed as all identifiers were exact

3. **Are all facts verified?** Yes, all data comes from function returns:
   - Current user: `who_am_i()` returned current_user="FphR_006"
   - Colleague ID: From step 2 result: "FphR_040"
   - Current user's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_006")` returned 2 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Colleague's projects: `search_projects(team_employee="FphR_040")` returned 3 projects with exact IDs, names, customer IDs, statuses
   - Shared project: Intersection found "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2"
   - Project details: Retrieved from project brief objects, all fields printed
   - Verification: `get_project("proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2")` confirmed team membership

No state-changing operations were performed (only read operations). No make-up data or sensible defaults used. All JSON values come from explicitly printed function returns.

The execution matches the expected output structure and contains all required fields.

{
  "current_user_employee_id": "FphR_006",
  "colleague_employee_id": "FphR_040",
  "shared_projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2",
      "name": "Wall and ceiling coating phase 2",
      "customer_id": "cust_freshfoods",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
Among your projects, Coppola Noemi (Noemi Coppola) is involved in one: 'Wall and ceiling coating phase 2' (project_id: proj_freshfoods_wall_coating_phase2) for the customer 'FreshFoods' (customer_id: cust_freshfoods), project status 'active'. You and Coppola Noemi are both team members on this project.
