I have verified the execution of Step 3 and confirm that all checklist items have been satisfied:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I extracted the list of known company locations directly from the provided context, performed exact matching for "Australia"/"Australien", applied fuzzy matching using the `fuzzy_compare` function, and conducted semantic/logical analysis to distinguish between "Austria" and "Australia".

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: All actions were performed exactly as specified:
   - Listed all 7 known locations from context
   - Performed exact substring search (no matches found)
   - Applied fuzzy matching (showed 87.5% similarity between "australia" and "austria")
   - Conducted semantic/logical check (confirmed Austria ≠ Australia)
   - Determined final result based on actual evidence

3. **All facts verified, not assumed**: 
   - Location list taken directly from context description
   - Exact matching results printed and verified (0 matches)
   - Fuzzy matching results printed from actual function call
   - Semantic analysis based on actual location names and geographic knowledge
   - No assumptions made about locations not mentioned in context

4. **JSON contains only verified values**:
   - `known_locations`: Directly from context
   - `australia_location_found`: False based on actual search results
   - `matched_location_names`: Empty array (no matches found)

5. **No state changes made**: Only read-only operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The analysis confirms that Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. does not have a physical presence in Australia, based on the publicly available location information provided in the context.
