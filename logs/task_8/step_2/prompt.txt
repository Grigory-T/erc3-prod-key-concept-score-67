Step 2: Identify the employee record corresponding to "Jan Schäfer" in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table for a person named "Jan Schäfer". First try an exact match on employee.name = 'Jan Schäfer'. If not found, relax the criteria: perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized matching, and then a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on employee.name (and, if needed, employee.email) using variants such as 'Jan Schaefer', 'Jan Schafer', possible missing diacritics, or minor misspellings, in line with the requirement that names can contain mistakes or typos. Also allow partial matching where the normalized search term is contained in the normalized field value. Use fuzzy matching scoring to pick the best candidate and ensure the confidence is above an internal threshold. If multiple high-confidence candidates exist, prefer the one with exact or nearest match; if no sufficiently confident match is found, treat the employee as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"target_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"target_employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["target_employee_found","candidate_count"]}
