We are at Step 3 of the global task. We have already resolved the current user (Nerea Palacios, ID: SrwB_029) and the target employee (Jan Schäfer, ID: SrwB_033). Now, we need to retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (SrwB_029) is a team member. This is "my projects".

Approach:
1. Use the current_user_employee_id from step 1: "SrwB_029".
2. Query the team_member table via the search_projects function? Actually, the function `search_projects` allows filtering by `team_employee` which is exactly what we need.
3. We can call `search_projects(team_employee="SrwB_029")` to get projects where this employee is a team member.
4. However, note that the function returns paginated results (limit 5). We might need to paginate to get all.
5. Alternatively, we can use `list_all_projects()` and then filter by team membership? But that would be inefficient and not necessary. Instead, we can paginate through `search_projects` until we have all.

But note: the function `search_projects` returns a tuple (list of ProjectBrief, next_offset). We can loop until next_offset is -1.

Let's write code to collect all projects where team_employee is "SrwB_029".

We'll also need to get full project details? The expected output requires: id, name, description, customer_id, status. The ProjectBrief object from search_projects only has id, name, customer, status. It does not have description. So we need to get the full project details for each project id.

However, the expected output includes description and customer_id (which is the customer field in ProjectBrief). The ProjectBrief has customer as a string (the customer id). So we can use that.

But for description, we need to get the full project details via `get_project` for each project id.

Alternatively, we can use `search_projects` and then for each project id, call `get_project` to get the full details including description.

Let's do:

1. Use pagination to get all project briefs for team_employee="SrwB_029".
2. For each project id, get the full project details (ProjectFull) which includes description.
3. Collect the required fields.

We must be cautious: the current user might be in many projects. We'll handle pagination.

Let's execute.

We have successfully retrieved the list of projects where the current user (SrwB_029) is a team member.
 We found 2 projects and collected their full details (id, name, description, customer_id, status).

 Now we need to output the required JSON.

We are verifying the execution of Step 3.

We have:
- Used the current_user_employee_id from step 1: "SrwB_029"
- Queried the team_member table by using the search_projects function with the team_employee filter set to "SrwB_029". This effectively returns projects where the user is a team member.
- We retrieved 2 projects and then obtained their full details using get_project for each.

The approach in the step says to query the team_member table and then join to project table. We used the search_projects function which does exactly that: it returns projects where the given employee is a team member.

We have printed and verified the data from the function returns.

We did not skip any actions. We did not assume any data. All data comes from the function returns.

We did not use any update functions, so no state was changed.

The JSON output we provided matches the expected output structure and contains only the data we printed.

Therefore, we are confident in our results.
