Completed: 2025-12-09 19:20:56

Successfully executed Step 3 as specified. Used the current user ID "SrwB_029" from step 1 to query projects where this employee is a team member. Used the search_projects function with team_employee filter, which effectively queries the team_member table and joins to project table as described in the approach. Retrieved 2 projects, obtained full details for each using get_project, and extracted the required fields (id, name, description, customer_id, status). All data comes from function returns with no assumptions or invented values. No state-changing operations were performed.
