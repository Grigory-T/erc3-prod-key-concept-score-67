Step 3: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (from step 1) is a team member, representing "my projects".
Approach: Using current_user_employee_id from step 1, query the team_member table with an exact match on employee_id. For each matching team_member row, collect the associated project_id. Then, join these project_ids to the project table to obtain full project details (id, name, description, customer_id, status, timestamps). If no direct matches are found, verify there were no identifier mismatches by confirming employee_id consistency; do not perform fuzzy search on project_id but allow **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching only if you need to interpret textual project.name fields (not necessary for this step since we only fetch by exact employee_id).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"my_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"my_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","status"]}},"my_project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["my_project_ids","my_project_count"]}
