Step 4 completed successfully. The permission check was executed by verifying the user's authentication status via who_am_i() and analyzing the company rules for access to project and team membership data. The user is authenticated (is_public=False) and is a team member of the projects in question. According to company rules:
- Authenticated users can read basic employee information (EmployeeProfile access via chatbot allows fields like name, location, department, etc.) for other employees, which covers reading Jan Schäfer's non-confidential details.
- There is no rule prohibiting a team member from reading project details or team membership for projects they are part of.
- The task does not involve accessing salary, HR notes, or other restricted fields, so no additional restrictions apply.
Thus, permission is granted for reading the required information.

No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from the function return (who_am_i() result) and the provided company rules.
