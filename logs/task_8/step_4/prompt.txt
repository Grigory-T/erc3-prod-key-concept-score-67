Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read project and team membership information needed to see where "Jan Schäfer" is involved within the user's projects.
Approach: Once current_user_employee_id (step 1), target_employee_id (step 2), and my_project_ids (step 3) are known, invoke the authorization and policy checks based on the current user’s system roles and company rules. Verify that the current user (department: Sales and Customer Success, location: Barcelona Office – Spain) is allowed to: (1) read entries from the project table for projects in my_project_ids and (2) read team_member entries (including those of other employees such as target_employee_id) for those projects. Since the task only involves reading project and team membership information and does not touch salary or confidential human resources notes, expect this to be permitted, but explicitly confirm this via a who_am_i() and role/permission check against the applicable access control configuration.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["permission_granted"]}
