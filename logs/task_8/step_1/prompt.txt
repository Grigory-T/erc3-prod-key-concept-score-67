Step 1: Resolve the current authenticated user ("Nerea Palacios", internal identifier "SrwB_029") to an employee record in the employee table.
Approach: Use the bound session identity for the current user (id = "SrwB_029" and associated corporate identity, such as email) to query the employee table and retrieve the exact matching employee row. Start with exact matching on a stable identifier (prefer employee.id or email). If the direct lookup by identifier is not possible, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on the employee.name and employee.email fields for "Nerea Palacios" (accounting for possible misspellings, extra spaces, casing differences). Confirm that exactly one employee record corresponds to the current user; if multiple candidates are found, select the one with the highest confidence score based on fuzzy comparison; if still ambiguous, flag for clarification (conceptually, although this plan assumes a single resolved record).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_employee_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_record_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["current_user_employee_id","employee_record_found"]}
