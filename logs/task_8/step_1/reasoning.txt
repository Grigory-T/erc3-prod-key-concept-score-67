We are asked to resolve the current authenticated user to an employee record.
 The current user has id "SrwB_029" and name "Nerea Palacios".
 We have a function `get_employee(employee_id: str)` that returns an EmployeeFull object if found, else None.
 Since we have the exact employee_id, we can start by trying that.

 However, note that the step says: "Start with exact matching on a stable identifier (prefer employee.id or email)."
 We have the employee_id from the context: "SrwB_029". So we try that.

 But the step also says: "If the direct lookup by identifier is not possible, perform a fuzzy and semantic/logical search ..."
 So we try direct lookup first.

 Let's do:
   employee = get_employee("SrwB_029")

 If that returns an employee, then we are done.

 If not, then we will have to search by name and email.

 However, note that the user is authenticated with id "SrwB_029", so the system should have that employee id.

 We are also to output:
   {"current_user_employee_id": string, "current_user_employee_name": string, "employee_record_found": boolean}

 If found, set employee_record_found to true and provide the id and name from the record.

 If not found, then we set employee_record_found to false and current_user_employee_id to the provided id (or empty?).
 But the step says: "if multiple candidates ... flag for clarification". However, the expected output doesn't have a field for that.
 We'll assume we must output the found one or if not found, set employee_record_found to false.

 Let's execute.

We have successfully found the employee record using exact match by ID.
 The expected output requires:
   - current_user_employee_id (string)
   - current_user_employee_name (string) 
   - employee_record_found (boolean)

 We have:
   current_user_employee_id: "SrwB_029"
   current_user_employee_name: "Nerea Palacios"
   employee_record_found: True

 Let's prepare the JSON accordingly.

We are asked to verify the step execution and then provide the final answer and JSON blocks.
 We have already executed the step and found the employee record for the current user.
 Let's verify the checklist:

 1. Did you execute the step instruction?
    - Yes, we executed the step instruction by first trying an exact match on employee ID (which succeeded) and then we would have performed fuzzy and semantic/logical search if the exact match failed.

 2. Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
    - We did not skip any action. The exact match by employee ID was successful, so we did not need to proceed to fuzzy or semantic search. This is in line with the approach: "Start with exact matching on a stable identifier (prefer employee.id or email)".

 3. Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
    - Yes, we used the function `get_employee` with the exact ID and printed the result. The employee record was found and the details (ID, name, email, location, department) were printed and match the context.

 4. JSON response must contain only values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
    - We printed the employee ID and name from the employee record we found, so these are verified.

 5. We did not use any made-up data or sensible defaults.

 6. We did not change the state of any object (we only read data), so no state-changing operations were performed.

 Since we are confident that the step was completed correctly and the employee record was found, we can now provide the final answer and JSON output.

 However, note that the expected output requires only three fields: current_user_employee_id, current_user_employee_name, and employee_record_found.
 We have all three: 
   current_user_employee_id = "SrwB_029"
   current_user_employee_name = "Nerea Palacios"
   employee_record_found = True

 Let's produce the final answer and JSON.
