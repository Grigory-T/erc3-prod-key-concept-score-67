# Company: Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
Locations: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria
Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-11-17
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_029
User details: {"id": "SrwB_029", "name": "Nerea Palacios", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "Barcelona Office \u2013 Spain"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: SrwB_029
department: Sales & Customer Success
location: Barcelona Office – Spain
today date: 2025-11-17
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** In which of my projects is Jan Schäfer involved

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Resolve the current authenticated user ("Nerea Palacios", internal identifier "SrwB_029") to an employee record in the employee table.
Approach: Use the bound session identity for the current user (id = "SrwB_029" and associated corporate identity, such as email) to query the employee table and retrieve the exact matching employee row. Start with exact matching on a stable identifier (prefer employee.id or email). If the direct lookup by identifier is not possible, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on the employee.name and employee.email fields for "Nerea Palacios" (accounting for possible misspellings, extra spaces, casing differences). Confirm that exactly one employee record corresponds to the current user; if multiple candidates are found, select the one with the highest confidence score based on fuzzy comparison; if still ambiguous, flag for clarification (conceptually, although this plan assumes a single resolved record).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_employee_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_record_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["current_user_employee_id","employee_record_found"]}
**Result:** Successfully resolved the current authenticated user to an employee record. Found exact match by employee ID "SrwB_029" which corresponds to Nerea Palacios. The employee record was successfully retrieved from the employee table using direct lookup by identifier as specified in the approach.

{
  "current_user_employee_id": "SrwB_029",
  "current_user_employee_name": "Nerea Palacios",
  "employee_record_found": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the employee record corresponding to "Jan Schäfer" in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table for a person named "Jan Schäfer". First try an exact match on employee.name = 'Jan Schäfer'. If not found, relax the criteria: perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized matching, and then a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on employee.name (and, if needed, employee.email) using variants such as 'Jan Schaefer', 'Jan Schafer', possible missing diacritics, or minor misspellings, in line with the requirement that names can contain mistakes or typos. Also allow partial matching where the normalized search term is contained in the normalized field value. Use fuzzy matching scoring to pick the best candidate and ensure the confidence is above an internal threshold. If multiple high-confidence candidates exist, prefer the one with exact or nearest match; if no sufficiently confident match is found, treat the employee as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"target_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"target_employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["target_employee_found","candidate_count"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 2. Found exactly one employee matching "Jan Schäfer" through exact case-insensitive matching. No fuzzy matching was needed as an exact match was found. Retrieved and verified full employee details. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "target_employee_id": "SrwB_033",
  "target_employee_name": "Jan Schäfer",
  "target_employee_found": true,
  "candidate_count": 1
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of all projects in which the current user (from step 1) is a team member, representing "my projects".
Approach: Using current_user_employee_id from step 1, query the team_member table with an exact match on employee_id. For each matching team_member row, collect the associated project_id. Then, join these project_ids to the project table to obtain full project details (id, name, description, customer_id, status, timestamps). If no direct matches are found, verify there were no identifier mismatches by confirming employee_id consistency; do not perform fuzzy search on project_id but allow **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching only if you need to interpret textual project.name fields (not necessary for this step since we only fetch by exact employee_id).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"my_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"my_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","status"]}},"my_project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["my_project_ids","my_project_count"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 3 as specified. Used the current user ID "SrwB_029" from step 1 to query projects where this employee is a team member. Used the search_projects function with team_employee filter, which effectively queries the team_member table and joins to project table as described in the approach. Retrieved 2 projects, obtained full details for each using get_project, and extracted the required fields (id, name, description, customer_id, status). All data comes from function returns with no assumptions or invented values. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "my_project_ids": ["proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer"],
  "my_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade",
      "name": "Low-VOC floor system upgrade",
      "description": "Upgrade of floor coating system to a lower-VOC, regulation-compliant version.",
      "customer_id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "status": "exploring"
    },
    {
      "id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "description": "Trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures.",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "status": "exploring"
    }
  ],
  "my_project_count": 2
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to read project and team membership information needed to see where "Jan Schäfer" is involved within the user's projects.
Approach: Once current_user_employee_id (step 1), target_employee_id (step 2), and my_project_ids (step 3) are known, invoke the authorization and policy checks based on the current user’s system roles and company rules. Verify that the current user (department: Sales and Customer Success, location: Barcelona Office – Spain) is allowed to: (1) read entries from the project table for projects in my_project_ids and (2) read team_member entries (including those of other employees such as target_employee_id) for those projects. Since the task only involves reading project and team membership information and does not touch salary or confidential human resources notes, expect this to be permitted, but explicitly confirm this via a who_am_i() and role/permission check against the applicable access control configuration.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["permission_granted"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. The permission check was executed by verifying the user's authentication status via who_am_i() and analyzing the company rules for access to project and team membership data. The user is authenticated (is_public=False) and is a team member of the projects in question. According to company rules:
- Authenticated users can read basic employee information (EmployeeProfile access via chatbot allows fields like name, location, department, etc.) for other employees, which covers reading Jan Schäfer's non-confidential details.
- There is no rule prohibiting a team member from reading project details or team membership for projects they are part of.
- The task does not involve accessing salary, HR notes, or other restricted fields, so no additional restrictions apply.
Thus, permission is granted for reading the required information.

No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from the function return (who_am_i() result) and the provided company rules.

{
  "permission_granted": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Determine in which of the current user's projects the employee "Jan Schäfer" is also involved as a team member, and compile the final list.
Approach: If permission_granted from step 4 is true and target_employee_found from step 2 is true, query the team_member table for rows where employee_id equals target_employee_id and project_id is in my_project_ids from step 3. Use exact matching on employee_id and project_id; if any textual project names are used to double-check or present results, allow **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching only for interpreting or de-duplicating names with possible typos but do not change the underlying exact project_id selection. Join the resulting project_ids with the project table to get project details. The final answer is the list of projects (id, name, and relevant metadata) that are in the intersection of: (a) projects where the current user is a team member and (b) projects where "Jan Schäfer" is a team member. If permissions are denied or the target employee is not found, return an empty list along with appropriate flags.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"shared_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"shared_project_count":{"type":"integer"},"target_employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["shared_projects","shared_project_count","target_employee_found","permission_granted"]}

[ASSISTANT] (message 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute Step 5 to determine which of Nerea's projects Jan Schäfer is involved in as a team member.

```python
# Step 5: Determine shared projects between Nerea and Jan Schäfer

# Get information from previous steps
print("=== Step 5: Finding Shared Projects ===")

# From previous steps:
current_user_projects = ["proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade", "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer"]
target_employee_id = "SrwB_033"  # Jan Schäfer

print(f"Current user's projects: {current_user_projects}")
print(f"Target employee ID: {target_employee_id}")

# We need to check for each project if Jan Schäfer is a team member
# Approach: Use search_projects with team_employee filter to find all projects Jan is in,

I need to verify if Jan Schäfer is actually in any of Nerea's projects. Since `search_projects` with `team_employee` filter returned 0 projects, let me double-check by examining the actual team composition of each of Nerea's projects.

Now I have the complete information. Jan Schäfer is not involved in any projects in the system, so there are no shared projects with Nerea. Let me provide the final output.

<final_answer>
Step 5 completed successfully. I determined that Jan Schäfer is not a team member in any projects in the system, therefore there are no shared projects between Nerea Palacios and Jan Schäfer. The intersection of Nerea's projects and Jan's projects is empty. All necessary data was retrieved by examining all 36 projects in the system and checking their team compositions. No state-changing operations were performed.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Determine in which of the current user's projects the employee "Jan Schäfer" is also involved as a team member, and compile the final list.
Approach: If permission_granted from step 4 is true and target_employee_found from step 2 is true, query the team_member table for rows where employee_id equals target_employee_id and project_id is in my_project_ids from step 3. Use exact matching on employee_id and project_id; if any textual project names are used to double-check or present results, allow **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching only for interpreting or de-duplicating names with possible typos but do not change the underlying exact project_id selection. Join the resulting project_ids with the project table to get project details. The final answer is the list of projects (id, name, and relevant metadata) that are in the intersection of: (a) projects where the current user is a team member and (b) projects where "Jan Schäfer" is a team member. If permissions are denied or the target employee is not found, return an empty list along with appropriate flags.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"shared_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"shared_project_count":{"type":"integer"},"target_employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["shared_projects","shared_project_count","target_employee_found","permission_granted"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

Step 5 executed exactly as specified. I queried the team membership for each of Nerea Palacios's projects (proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade and proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer) by retrieving their full project details and examining the team lists. Jan Schäfer (employee ID: SrwB_033) was not found in either project's team. I also verified that Jan Schäfer is not a team member in any of the 36 projects in the system by checking all projects. No fuzzy matching was needed as we used exact matching on employee IDs and project IDs. The intersection of projects where Nerea is a team member and projects where Jan is a team member is empty. No state-changing operations were performed.
