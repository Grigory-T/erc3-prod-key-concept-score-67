Step 5 executed exactly as specified. I queried the team membership for each of Nerea Palacios's projects (proj_euro_flooring_low_voc_upgrade and proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer) by retrieving their full project details and examining the team lists. Jan Schäfer (employee ID: SrwB_033) was not found in either project's team. I also verified that Jan Schäfer is not a team member in any of the 36 projects in the system by checking all projects. No fuzzy matching was needed as we used exact matching on employee IDs and project IDs. The intersection of projects where Nerea is a team member and projects where Jan is a team member is empty. No state-changing operations were performed.
