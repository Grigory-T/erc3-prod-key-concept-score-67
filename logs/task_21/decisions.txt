DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:07:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is still valid. No unexpected results or missing information so far. Step 1 was performed correctly by interpreting the user question and logical condition. The next planned step is to determine the user's actor identity and permissions before accessing any location information, which aligns with company policies. All completed work is progressing as intended.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:09:09
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is proceeding as intended. Steps 1 and 2 completed successfully: the logical condition is clarified and the user was verified to be a public, unauthenticated guest, requiring that no internal systems are accessed. The next step, 3, involves gathering company locations from session context or public info, which is allowed and possible with the provided session data. No issues or discrepancies have occurred, and the next step can proceed exactly as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:12:24
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have been correctly completed so far and the next planned step (Step 4) can be performed using the gathered location list. No issues, missing data, or inconsistencies prevent completion of the next step as per original plan. Therefore, the plan should proceed to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:14:56
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps have returned expected and correct results according to the original plan. The last required step is to compute the final answer based on previously obtained booleans: has_australia=false and has_munich_office_germany=true. The logical AND is false, so the answer is definitively 'No'. The original plan specifies providing a single literal answer ('Yes' or 'No') as the final output.
