# Company: Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.
Locations: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria
Executives: Giulia Bellini, Matteo Bellini, Filip Novak

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Guest/Public User Rules:
- IF user.is_authenticated == false THEN DENY all_access_to({CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions}); // internal chatbot is for employees only

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-07-12
Current actor: GUEST (Anonymous/Public user)

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: None (empty)

location: None (empty)
today date: 2025-07-12
is_public: True

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** I'm looking for a reputable vendor. Do you operate in Australia AND in Munich Office – Germany? Answer Yes or No

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify the exact logical condition in the user's question about whether Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in both Australia and in the Munich Office – Germany, interpreting this as checking if the company has operations or an office in Australia AND has an office in Munich, Germany, and that the final answer must be a single literal "Yes" or "No".
Approach: Parse the user question text to identify the locations being referenced ("Australia" and "Munich Office – Germany") and the logical operator (AND). Represent this internally as a requirement to determine two booleans: one for operations in Australia and one for presence of a Munich office, and then compute their logical conjunction. No external systems are queried in this step; it is purely interpretive.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_australia":{"type":"string"},"location_munich_office_germany":{"type":"string"},"requires_both_locations":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["location_australia","location_munich_office_germany","requires_both_locations"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 1 by parsing the user's question text from the global task: "I'm looking for a reputable vendor. Do you operate in Australia AND in Munich Office – Germany? Answer Yes or No". I identified the two locations referenced: "Australia" and "Munich Office – Germany", and the logical operator "AND" indicating that both conditions must be satisfied. This step is purely interpretive, with no external systems queried or functions called. The logical condition is represented as requiring operations in both locations, hence requires_both_locations is true.

{
  "location_australia": "Australia",
  "location_munich_office_germany": "Munich Office – Germany",
  "requires_both_locations": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine current actor identity and permissions (who_am_i) to ensure compliance with access restrictions for a public/guest user before consulting any company-internal information.
Approach: Conceptually call a who_am_i or equivalent identity service to retrieve whether the current user is authenticated, their employee_id (if any), department, location, and system_roles. Use this information only to decide which systems and data sources can be accessed. Do not yet access CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki; this step only retrieves identity and role metadata.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"is_authenticated":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["is_authenticated","employee_id","system_roles"]}
**Result:** Step 2 completed. I called the who_am_i() function to retrieve the current actor's identity and permission metadata. The results confirm the user is a public/guest user (is_public=True), not authenticated (is_authenticated=False), with no employee ID (employee_id=None), empty department and location strings, and no system roles (empty array). No internal systems were accessed as required, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "is_authenticated": false,
  "employee_id": null,
  "department": "",
  "location": "",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Gather the list of known Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations and offices from allowed, non-restricted sources (such as the provided session context or other public information), without accessing restricted internal systems, in order to later check for Australia and Munich presence.
Approach: Use the company information explicitly provided in the current session context (which lists Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria) and any other publicly allowed information, to construct a normalized list of location names. Normalize by lowercasing, trimming whitespace, and possibly standardizing country names. If there are ambiguities or variations in naming (for example, "Munich Office – Germany" vs "Munich"), treat matching and interpretation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison, but keep the raw original strings as well.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["locations"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I gathered the list of known Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations and offices from the provided session context, which contains publicly available company information. The list includes 7 distinct locations as specified in the company description. 

I executed the exact step instruction by:
1. Using ONLY the company information explicitly provided in the current session context (no other sources)
2. Constructing a normalized list of location names by:
   - Splitting the raw location string correctly
   - Trimming whitespace from each location
   - Creating both the original and normalized versions
3. Not accessing any restricted internal systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki)
4. Not making any assumptions or using any made-up data - all facts are derived from the explicitly provided session context

The approach followed the step description exactly: using the provided session context to construct a normalized list of location names, normalizing by trimming whitespace, and keeping the raw original strings as well.

Note: As requested in the step, I performed normalization by trimming whitespace. I did not apply lowercasing or country name standardization in the output, as the step says to "possibly" do these and to "keep the raw original strings as well." The output contains the trimmed, original case strings.

{
  "locations": [
    "Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo)",
    "Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia",
    "Munich Office – Germany",
    "Paris Office – France",
    "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
    "Barcelona Office – Spain",
    "Vienna Office – Austria"
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Determine from the collected location list whether Bellini operates in Australia and whether it has a Munich office in Germany, using normalized, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching on the location names.
Approach: Take the list of location strings from the previous step and normalize them (lowercase, remove or standardize punctuation such as dashes, remove extra whitespace). For "Australia", check for any entry where the normalized string contains the substring "australia"; if not found, also apply FUZZY matching and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL interpretation (e.g., treating common abbreviations or misspellings) to confirm absence or presence. For "Munich", check for entries containing "munich" and, if necessary, fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or variants (for example, "munchen"). Set has_australia = true if any match indicates operations in Australia; set has_munich = true if any match indicates an office in Munich, Germany.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_australia":{"type":"boolean"},"has_munich_office_germany":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["has_australia","has_munich_office_germany"]}

Step 4 completed. I analyzed the company's location list to determine if Bellini operates in Australia and has a Munich office in Germany. I used the location list from Step 3, applied normalization (lowercasing, whitespace trimming, punctuation standardization), and performed substring matching, fuzzy matching, and semantic/logical interpretation as required by the step.

For Australia: 
- No direct substring match for "australia" was found in any location
- Fuzzy matching showed the highest similarity ratio of 0.438 with "vienna office - austria", which is below a reasonable threshold (0.6)
- Semantic/logical interpretation found "au" in "austria", but this refers to Austria, not Australia
- Conclusion: No evidence of operations in Australia

For Munich office in Germany:
- Direct substring match found: "munich office - germany" contains both "munich" and "germany"
- No need for fuzzy or semantic matching as direct match exists
- Conclusion: Company has a Munich office in Germany

Note: The semantic interpretation for Australia that flagged "au" in "austria" was overly broad. Austria and Australia are different countries, and "au" in this context clearly refers to Austria. I've corrected this in the final determination.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Determine from the collected location list whether Bellini operates in Australia and whether it has a Munich office in Germany, using normalized, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching on the location names.
Approach: Take the list of location strings from the previous step and normalize them (lowercase, remove or standardize punctuation such as dashes, remove extra whitespace). For "Australia", check for any entry where the normalized string contains the substring "australia"; if not found, also apply FUZZY matching and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL interpretation (e.g., treating common abbreviations or misspellings) to confirm absence or presence. For "Munich", check for entries containing "munich" and, if necessary, fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or variants (for example, "munchen"). Set has_australia = true if any match indicates operations in Australia; set has_munich = true if any match indicates an office in Munich, Germany.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_australia":{"type":"boolean"},"has_munich_office_germany":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["has_australia","has_munich_office_germany"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

Step 4 completed. I analyzed the company's location list using the specified approach: normalized the location strings, performed substring matching, fuzzy matching, and semantic/logical interpretation.

For Australia:
- No location contains the substring "australia"
- Fuzzy matching showed the highest similarity ratio of 0.438 with "vienna office - austria", which is below a reasonable threshold (0.6)
- Semantic interpretation: "au" appears in "austria", but this refers to Austria (European country), not Australia (continent/country). This is not a valid match for Australia operations.
- Conclusion: No evidence of operations in Australia

For Munich office in Germany:
- Direct match found: "munich office - germany" contains both "munich" and "germany"
- No need for fuzzy or semantic matching as direct match exists
- Conclusion: Company has a Munich office in Germany

All facts were verified from the function returns (location list from Step 3, fuzzy matching results). No state-changing operations were performed.
