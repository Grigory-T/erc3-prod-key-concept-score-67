Step 4: Determine from the collected location list whether Bellini operates in Australia and whether it has a Munich office in Germany, using normalized, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching on the location names.
Approach: Take the list of location strings from the previous step and normalize them (lowercase, remove or standardize punctuation such as dashes, remove extra whitespace). For "Australia", check for any entry where the normalized string contains the substring "australia"; if not found, also apply FUZZY matching and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL interpretation (e.g., treating common abbreviations or misspellings) to confirm absence or presence. For "Munich", check for entries containing "munich" and, if necessary, fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or variants (for example, "munchen"). Set has_australia = true if any match indicates operations in Australia; set has_munich = true if any match indicates an office in Munich, Germany.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_australia":{"type":"boolean"},"has_munich_office_germany":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["has_australia","has_munich_office_germany"]}
