Step 4 completed. I analyzed the company's location list using the specified approach: normalized the location strings, performed substring matching, fuzzy matching, and semantic/logical interpretation.

For Australia:
- No location contains the substring "australia"
- Fuzzy matching showed the highest similarity ratio of 0.438 with "vienna office - austria", which is below a reasonable threshold (0.6)
- Semantic interpretation: "au" appears in "austria", but this refers to Austria (European country), not Australia (continent/country). This is not a valid match for Australia operations.
- Conclusion: No evidence of operations in Australia

For Munich office in Germany:
- Direct match found: "munich office - germany" contains both "munich" and "germany"
- No need for fuzzy or semantic matching as direct match exists
- Conclusion: Company has a Munich office in Germany

All facts were verified from the function returns (location list from Step 3, fuzzy matching results). No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "has_australia": false,
  "has_munich_office_germany": true
}
