Step 2: Determine current actor identity and permissions (who_am_i) to ensure compliance with access restrictions for a public/guest user before consulting any company-internal information.
Approach: Conceptually call a who_am_i or equivalent identity service to retrieve whether the current user is authenticated, their employee_id (if any), department, location, and system_roles. Use this information only to decide which systems and data sources can be accessed. Do not yet access CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki; this step only retrieves identity and role metadata.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"is_authenticated":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"department":{"type":["string","null"]},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["is_authenticated","employee_id","system_roles"]}
