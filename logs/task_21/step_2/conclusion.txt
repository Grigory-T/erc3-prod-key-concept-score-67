Step 2 completed. I called the who_am_i() function to retrieve the current actor's identity and permission metadata. The results confirm the user is a public/guest user (is_public=True), not authenticated (is_authenticated=False), with no employee ID (employee_id=None), empty department and location strings, and no system roles (empty array). No internal systems were accessed as required, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "is_authenticated": false,
  "employee_id": null,
  "department": "",
  "location": "",
  "system_roles": []
}
