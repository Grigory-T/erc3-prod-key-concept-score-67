Step 3: Gather the list of known Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations and offices from allowed, non-restricted sources (such as the provided session context or other public information), without accessing restricted internal systems, in order to later check for Australia and Munich presence.
Approach: Use the company information explicitly provided in the current session context (which lists Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria) and any other publicly allowed information, to construct a normalized list of location names. Normalize by lowercasing, trimming whitespace, and possibly standardizing country names. If there are ambiguities or variations in naming (for example, "Munich Office – Germany" vs "Munich"), treat matching and interpretation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison, but keep the raw original strings as well.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["locations"]}
