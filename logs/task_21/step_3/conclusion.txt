Step 3 completed successfully. I gathered the list of known Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations and offices from the provided session context, which contains publicly available company information. The list includes 7 distinct locations as specified in the company description. 

I executed the exact step instruction by:
1. Using ONLY the company information explicitly provided in the current session context (no other sources)
2. Constructing a normalized list of location names by:
   - Splitting the raw location string correctly
   - Trimming whitespace from each location
   - Creating both the original and normalized versions
3. Not accessing any restricted internal systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki)
4. Not making any assumptions or using any made-up data - all facts are derived from the explicitly provided session context

The approach followed the step description exactly: using the provided session context to construct a normalized list of location names, normalizing by trimming whitespace, and keeping the raw original strings as well.

Note: As requested in the step, I performed normalization by trimming whitespace. I did not apply lowercasing or country name standardization in the output, as the step says to "possibly" do these and to "keep the raw original strings as well." The output contains the trimmed, original case strings.

    "Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo)",
    "Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia",

    "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
    "Barcelona Office – Spain",
    "Vienna Office – Austria"
