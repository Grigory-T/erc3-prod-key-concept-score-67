I executed Step 1 by parsing the user's question text from the global task: "I'm looking for a reputable vendor. Do you operate in Australia AND in Munich Office – Germany? Answer Yes or No". I identified the two locations referenced: "Australia" and "Munich Office – Germany", and the logical operator "AND" indicating that both conditions must be satisfied. This step is purely interpretive, with no external systems queried or functions called. The logical condition is represented as requiring operations in both locations, hence requires_both_locations is true.

{
  "location_australia": "Australia",
  "location_munich_office_germany": "Munich Office – Germany",
  "requires_both_locations": true
}
