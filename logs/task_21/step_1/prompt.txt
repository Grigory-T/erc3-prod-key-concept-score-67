Step 1: Clarify the exact logical condition in the user's question about whether Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in both Australia and in the Munich Office – Germany, interpreting this as checking if the company has operations or an office in Australia AND has an office in Munich, Germany, and that the final answer must be a single literal "Yes" or "No".
Approach: Parse the user question text to identify the locations being referenced ("Australia" and "Munich Office – Germany") and the logical operator (AND). Represent this internally as a requirement to determine two booleans: one for operations in Australia and one for presence of a Munich office, and then compute their logical conjunction. No external systems are queried in this step; it is purely interpretive.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_australia":{"type":"string"},"location_munich_office_germany":{"type":"string"},"requires_both_locations":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["location_australia","location_munich_office_germany","requires_both_locations"]}
