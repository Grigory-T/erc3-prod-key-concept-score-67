The wiki search using fuzzy and semantic matching found documents containing the terms "Central Steel" and "Spanish administration," but upon closer examination, these were not references to actual customer entities. The term "Central Steel" appears only in the context of industrial markets (structural steel industry), and "Spanish administration" appears in organizational contexts (systems administration). No wiki documentation was found that clarifies how these specific customers are named or referenced as customer entities in the CRM. The CRM contains a customer named "CentralSteel Engineers" (not "CentralSteel Engineering") in Poland, but this exact customer name does not appear in any wiki documentation.
