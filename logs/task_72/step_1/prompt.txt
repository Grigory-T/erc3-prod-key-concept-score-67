Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation to understand how customers like 'CentralSteel Engineering' and 'Spanish Government' are typically named and referenced, and to detect any aliases or common variants for these customer names.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms related to 'CentralSteel Engineering', 'Central Steel', 'CentralSteel', 'Polish structural steel engineering', 'Spanish Government', 'Government of Spain', 'Kingdom of Spain', 'Spain - public sector' and similar variants, fully expanding abbreviations where encountered. Account for possible misspellings, spacing differences, and partial matches by using fuzzy matching and semantic search across both the path and content fields. Do not perform any updates; only retrieve references that might clarify how these customers are named and whether they exist as standard customer records in the CRM.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "centralsteel_docs_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "spanish_government_docs_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "centralsteel_doc_paths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "spanish_government_doc_paths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["centralsteel_docs_found", "spanish_government_docs_found"] }
