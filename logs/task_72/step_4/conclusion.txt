I have completed Step 4 by counting projects for the selected customer records. From Step 2, I selected the best-matching customer for each target based on highest fuzzy match score:

1. For "Polish structural steel engineering customer CentralSteel Engineering": Selected "CentralSteel Engineers" (ID: cust_centralsteel_engineering) with match score 0.913
2. For "Spanish Government": Selected "Iberia Construction" (ID: cust_iberia_construction) with match score 0.270

I used exact customer_id matching to count all projects regardless of status, verifying each project individually. CentralSteel Engineers has 1 project ("Galvanised steel touch-up system", status: exploring). Iberia Construction has 2 projects ("Structural steel protection system" and "Fire-protection topcoat certification", both status: exploring).

I performed additional verification by searching for any other Spanish government-related customers using broader semantic matching with terms like "government," "public," "administration," etc. Only Iberia Construction was found in Spain, confirming it is the best available match in the CRM for "Spanish Government."

{
  "centralsteel_selected_customer_id": "cust_centralsteel_engineering",
  "spanish_government_selected_customer_id": "cust_iberia_construction",
  "centralsteel_project_count": 1,
  "spanish_government_project_count": 2
}
