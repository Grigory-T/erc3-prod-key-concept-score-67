## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-12-06
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_001
User details: {"id": "QR23_001", "name": "Antonio Esposito", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Which customer has more projects: Polish structural steel engineering customer CentralSteel Engineering or Spanish Government? Link only the customer that has more, or none if they are tied.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki and documentation to understand how customers like 'CentralSteel Engineering' and 'Spanish Government' are typically named and referenced, and to detect any aliases or common variants for these customer names.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms related to 'CentralSteel Engineering', 'Central Steel', 'CentralSteel', 'Polish structural steel engineering', 'Spanish Government', 'Government of Spain', 'Kingdom of Spain', 'Spain - public sector' and similar variants, fully expanding abbreviations where encountered. Account for possible misspellings, spacing differences, and partial matches by using fuzzy matching and semantic search across both the path and content fields. Do not perform any updates; only retrieve references that might clarify how these customers are named and whether they exist as standard customer records in the CRM.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "centralsteel_docs_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "spanish_government_docs_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "centralsteel_doc_paths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "spanish_government_doc_paths": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } } }, "required": ["centralsteel_docs_found", "spanish_government_docs_found"] }
**Result:** The wiki search using fuzzy and semantic matching found documents containing the terms "Central Steel" and "Spanish administration," but upon closer examination, these were not references to actual customer entities. The term "Central Steel" appears only in the context of industrial markets (structural steel industry), and "Spanish administration" appears in organizational contexts (systems administration). No wiki documentation was found that clarifies how these specific customers are named or referenced as customer entities in the CRM. The CRM contains a customer named "CentralSteel Engineers" (not "CentralSteel Engineering") in Poland, but this exact customer name does not appear in any wiki documentation.

{
  "centralsteel_docs_found": false,
  "spanish_government_docs_found": false,
  "centralsteel_doc_paths": [],
  "spanish_government_doc_paths": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the corresponding customer records in the customer table for 'Polish structural steel engineering customer CentralSteel Engineering' and 'Spanish Government', using flexible name and description matching.
Approach: Query the customer table in the CRM home system using a combination of exact, partial, **FUZZY**, and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on the name and brief fields. For the first customer, search for strings and variants such as 'CentralSteel Engineering', 'Central Steel Engineering', 'CentralSteel', combined with descriptors like 'Poland', 'Polish', 'structural steel', 'engineering'. For the second, search for 'Spanish Government', 'Government of Spain', 'Kingdom of Spain', 'Gobierno de España', and similar. Normalize strings to lowercase and trim whitespace before containment checks; if exact matches are not found, progressively relax filters to use substring, regex, and fuzzy matching. If multiple candidate customers are found, keep all with their match scores rather than choosing one at this step. Take into account that names may contain typos or be embedded within longer customer names.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "centralsteel_candidates": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "brief": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "match_score": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["customer_id", "name", "match_score"] } }, "spanish_government_candidates": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "brief": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "match_score": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["customer_id", "name", "match_score"] } } }, "required": ["centralsteel_candidates", "spanish_government_candidates"] }
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 by identifying customer records for both specified customers using exact, partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching. 

For "Polish structural steel engineering customer CentralSteel Engineering", I found one strong candidate: "CentralSteel Engineers" (ID: cust_centralsteel_engineering) located in Poland, with a fuzzy match score of 0.913. This aligns with the description and matches the exact customer mentioned in Step 1. Two additional customers with steel-related names but lower match scores were also included.

For "Spanish Government", I found one candidate: "Iberia Construction" (ID: cust_iberia_construction) located in Spain, but with a low fuzzy match score of 0.270. Additional checks revealed no customers with "government", "public", or related terms in their names or briefs. No other Spanish government entities were found in the CRM.

All matching was performed using the available functions including search_customers, list_all_customers, get_customer, and fuzzy_compare. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "centralsteel_candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_centralsteel_engineering",
      "name": "CentralSteel Engineers",
      "brief": "Engineering firm delivering structural steel packages for factories and warehouses.",
      "match_score": 0.913
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_danubesteel_structures",
      "name": "DanubeSteel Structures",
      "brief": "Fabricator of large structural steel for bridges and industrial sites along the Danube.",
      "match_score": 0.348
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_carpathia_metalworks",
      "name": "Carpathia Metalworkers",
      "brief": "Regional fabricator of steel components for machinery and construction.",
      "match_score": 0.343
    }
  ],
  "spanish_government_candidates": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_iberia_construction",
      "name": "Iberia Construction",
      "brief": "Regional construction and metalwork specialist.",
      "match_score": 0.270
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Check current user identity and permissions to ensure Antonio Esposito is allowed to read customer and project data for the identified customers.
Approach: Call a who_am_i-style identity check to bind the current user (employee_id 'QR23_001') with department, location, and system roles from the EmployeeRegistry. Using this bound identity, evaluate access rules: confirm that as a Corporate Leadership member (executive-level) Antonio is permitted to read entries from the customer and project tables in their respective home systems (CRM for customers, ProjectRegistry for projects). This step must occur after potential target customers are known, and should not perform any data reads beyond what is necessary to determine permissions.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "can_read_customers": { "type": "boolean" }, "can_read_projects": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "can_read_customers", "can_read_projects"] }

Completed Step 3 by checking current user identity and permissions. Antonio Esposito (QR23_001) is confirmed to have full read access to customer and project data as a member of Corporate Leadership. The permission evaluation confirms he can proceed with reading customer and project information for the identified customers.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Check current user identity and permissions to ensure Antonio Esposito is allowed to read customer and project data for the identified customers.
Approach: Call a who_am_i-style identity check to bind the current user (employee_id 'QR23_001') with department, location, and system roles from the EmployeeRegistry. Using this bound identity, evaluate access rules: confirm that as a Corporate Leadership member (executive-level) Antonio is permitted to read entries from the customer and project tables in their respective home systems (CRM for customers, ProjectRegistry for projects). This step must occur after potential target customers are known, and should not perform any data reads beyond what is necessary to determine permissions.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "can_read_customers": { "type": "boolean" }, "can_read_projects": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["employee_id", "can_read_customers", "can_read_projects"] }

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 3 as instructed. I called `who_am_i()` to bind the current user's identity and obtained the employee's full details via `get_employee()`. This verified the employee ID, department, and location. 

However, I encountered a limitation: the available API functions do not provide a direct way to retrieve the user's `system_roles` from the EmployeeRegistry. The `WhoAmI` and `EmployeeFull` models do not include a `system_roles` field. Despite this, based on the company rules and the user's department (Corporate Leadership), I have determined that the user has executive-level permissions and therefore can read both customer and project data. The `system_roles` array in the JSON output is left empty because it cannot be retrieved with the provided functions.

No state-changing operations were performed, and no customer or project data was read beyond the necessary identity and permission checks.
