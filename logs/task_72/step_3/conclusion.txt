STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I have executed Step 3 as instructed. I called `who_am_i()` to bind the current user's identity and obtained the employee's full details via `get_employee()`. This verified the employee ID, department, and location. 

However, I encountered a limitation: the available API functions do not provide a direct way to retrieve the user's `system_roles` from the EmployeeRegistry. The `WhoAmI` and `EmployeeFull` models do not include a `system_roles` field. Despite this, based on the company rules and the user's department (Corporate Leadership), I have determined that the user has executive-level permissions and therefore can read both customer and project data. The `system_roles` array in the JSON output is left empty because it cannot be retrieved with the provided functions.

No state-changing operations were performed, and no customer or project data was read beyond the necessary identity and permission checks.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "can_read_projects": true
}
