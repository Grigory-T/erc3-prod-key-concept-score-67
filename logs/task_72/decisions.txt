DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:48:46
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The result of Step 1 simply found that the wiki/docs do not reference either customer using the query terms, but this does not block the next planned step, which is to identify relevant customer records in the CRM using fuzzy and semantic matching. This matches the expected possibility in the original plan (the plan anticipates that documentation might not clarify naming and requires a direct CRM search next). There are no inconsistencies, missing functions, or unexplained results that require replanning. Therefore, the next logical step is to continue as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:55:50
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have been completed as per the plan: customer record candidates for both CentralSteel Engineering and the Spanish Government have been identified using required fuzzy and semantic matching in CRM, with proper output structure. No unexpected issues or missing functionality occurred. According to the plan, the next step is Step 3, which checks if Antonio Esposito (the current user) as Corporate Leadership is allowed to read customer and project data for these IDs. All information so far matches expected progress. No need to replan; the plan remains valid and possible.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:58:51
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan's steps have so far produced relevant and correct results. Step 3 successfully confirmed read access for the current user. There are no unexpected results or missing information; the best-matching customer candidates for both parties have been identified. The plan remains valid, and there is no reason to replan. Proceed to Step 4 to count projects for the selected customers.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:05:01
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been completed exactly according to the original plan, and all required data has been obtained. The project counts for each candidate customer were found: CentralSteel Engineers (Poland) has 1 project, Iberia Construction (best match for Spanish Government in the CRM) has 2 projects. The final step in the plan is to compare these and, as per instructions, link only the customer with more projects (in this case, Iberia Construction representing the Spanish Government). There are no blocked steps or unexpected outcomes requiring replanning. Therefore, the task is complete, and a definitive answer can be returned.
