Step 1 completed. I executed the required functions to determine the current user's identity and permissions. I called `who_am_i()` to get the user context and `get_employee()` to retrieve the employee record. Based on the user's department "Corporate Leadership" and company rules, I inferred the system role "ExecutiveLeadership". According to company rules, all authenticated users accessing via chatbot are allowed to read basic employee profile fields (name, email, location, department, and context-relevant subsets of skills and wills), so the user has employee data access. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_001",
  "name": "Nino Valente",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": ["ExecutiveLeadership"],
  "has_employee_data_access": true
}
