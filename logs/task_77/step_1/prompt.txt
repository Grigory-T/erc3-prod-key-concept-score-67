Step 1: Determine current user identity, roles and high-level permissions to access non-confidential employee data (names, locations, departments, skills) needed to identify potential coaches for Orlando Arianna.
Approach: Call an internal identity or who_am_i function or query the EmployeeRegistry to retrieve the current authenticated user (Nino Valente, id FphR_001), including department, location, and system_roles (for example, roles such as 'ExecutiveLeadership', 'Manager', 'HRAdmin', etc.). Based on company rules, infer whether this user is allowed to read basic employee profile fields (name, email, location, department) and skills (excluding salary and HR notes). Do not log any data; only determine permissions. This step involves no fuzzy search.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"has_employee_data_access":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","system_roles","has_employee_data_access"]}
