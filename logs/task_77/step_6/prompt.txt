Step 6: Prepare the final ranked list of employees who can coach Orlando Arianna on his skills, including only allowed fields and focusing on the most relevant coaches.
Approach: From the candidate_coaches data in Step 4, filter out any employees if access was denied in Step 5 (if can_view_coach_list is false, execution should abort; planning just notes this). For allowed access, construct a list where each entry includes: coach name, email, location, department, and the specific skills where the coach has a higher level than Orlando, possibly sorted by total number of overlapping skills and average or maximum level difference. Do not include salary or HR notes. Ensure that names, skills, and departments are taken as stored, but where skill equivalence was determined via FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching, show Orlando's and coach's skill names clearly. The output list will be what is returned to the user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"orlando_employee":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"coach_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"coaching_skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name_orlando":{"type":"string"},"skill_name_coach":{"type":"string"},"orlando_level":{"type":"integer"},"coach_level":{"type":"integer"},"level_gap":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["skill_name_orlando","skill_name_coach","orlando_level","coach_level","level_gap"]}}},"required":["employee_id","name","coaching_skills"]}}},"required":["orlando_employee","coach_candidates"]}
