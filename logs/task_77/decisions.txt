DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:58:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed as planned and produced the correct expected output, confirming the current user identity, system roles, and access permissions according to company policy. There were no unexpected or inconsistent results, and subsequent steps are feasible. According to the Original Plan, the next logical action is to proceed to Step 2: locating the target employee record for 'Orlando Arianna.' No replanning or abort is required; all prerequisites for the next step have been met.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:03:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 2 has produced a valid and expected result according to the original plan: the target employee was found via logical search as 'Arianna Orlando' (ID: FphR_062), which fits the criteria outlined for fuzzy/semantic name matching. No unexpected results or errors occurred. Ambiguity was noted correctly (Salvatore Orlando shares a surname but is a different person), but does not impact ability to continue. All company and task rules were observed. The plan remains fully viable, so the logical next step is to continue.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:04:38
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed steps (1–3) exactly matched the output and approach set in the Original Plan, yielding unambiguous and correct results: user permissions validated, Orlando Arianna (real identity: Arianna Orlando) identified, and all corresponding skills retrieved. No errors, unexpected results, or information gaps have occurred. The next step—finding potential coach employees for skill upskilling—remains relevant, actionable, and matches the plan's continuation logic. There is no reason to abort or replan. Proceed to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:16:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have completed successfully according to the original plan and company policies. The returned results from Step 4 match the plan's expectations—potential coach employees have been identified with correct skill-level comparisons, and no confidential information has been accessed. No unexpected issues or missing data have arisen. According to the plan, the next step is to verify access rights for the current user to view the list, which aligns directly with company-approved fields. Therefore, the plan remains valid; proceed to Step 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:19:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All plan steps up to Step 5 have been executed successfully according to the original plan. Each step's requirements were met and explicit factual outputs confirm that the task remains feasible exactly as planned. There were no errors, missing functions, or unexpected data. The only remaining step is Step 6, which instructs to prepare and output the final ranked coach list, using the data already obtained. Per company rules and the plan, the user is authorized to see the planned output. Thus, the plan remains valid and there is no need to replan. The next action should be to continue and complete Step 6 as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 23:33:24
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed successfully and strictly according to the plan, with each step producing expected and relevant results. The original task—to identify employees that can coach Orlando Arianna (Arianna Orlando) on skills they can improve further—has been fully satisfied, with a comprehensive and ranked list of coach candidates provided. No additional steps or corrections are necessary. All outputs are compliant with company policies and rules.
