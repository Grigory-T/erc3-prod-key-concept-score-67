We are in Step 3. We need to retrieve the full list of current skills for the confirmed employee record of Orlando Arianna (which we found as Arianna Orlando, id FphR_062). We must query the employee_skill table (but note: the function to get full employee details is get_employee, which returns an EmployeeFull object that includes a list of SkillLevel objects for skills and wills. We are to retrieve only skills (skill_type='skill'), not wills. In the EmployeeFull model, the 'skills' field is a list of SkillLevel objects, each with 'name' and 'level'. We must map these to the expected output fields: skill_name -> name, level -> level.

Since the task says "query the employee_skill table", but our available function is get_employee, we can use that. We must not include wills.

We have the employee_id from Step 2: FphR_062.

Let's call get_employee for FphR_062 and extract the skills.

We should also check if the employee exists (it should, as we found it in Step 2).

We must be cautious about permissions: the current user has employee data access (as determined in Step 1) and can read skills (context-relevant subset of skills). We are only reading basic fields and skills, which is allowed.

We are not to do any fuzzy search in this step.

Let's write code to retrieve the employee and extract the skills.

Note: The expected output requires:
- employee_id: string
- skills: array of objects with skill_name and level.

We must use the exact field names as specified: "skill_name" and "level".

In the SkillLevel object, the field is 'name'. So we need to map 'name' to 'skill_name'.

Let's do it.

We are in Step 3: Retrieve the full list of current skills for the confirmed employee record of Orlando Arianna.
 We have already identified the employee as Arianna Orlando with ID FphR_062.
 The output shows 15 skills with their levels.

 According to the expected output, we need to return:
   {
     "employee_id": "FphR_062",
     "skills": [
        {"skill_name": "skill_corrosion", "level": 3},
        ... (all 15 skills)
     ]
   }

 We have the list of skills from the employee object (employee.skills). We just need to format it.

 Note: The step says "query the employee_skill table" but we are using the get_employee function which returns
 an EmployeeFull object with a list of SkillLevel objects for skills.

 We have printed the skills and can now construct the JSON.

 However, note that the step says "Do not include 'will' entries for this task", and we are only looking at employee.skills,
 which is correct because the EmployeeFull object separates skills and wills.

 Let's double-check: the employee object has both skills and wills. We are only using skills.

 We will now create the JSON output.

The user is asking to verify Step 3. I need to confirm I executed the step correctly.

Looking at Step 3: Retrieve full list of current skills for the confirmed employee record of Orlando Arianna from the employee_skill table.

From Step 2, we identified the employee as Arianna Orlando (ID: FphR_062). We need to query the employee_skill table for all rows where employee_id equals Orlando's id and skill_type = 'skill'.

In my execution, I used get_employee(employee_id) which returns an EmployeeFull object containing skills (list of SkillLevel). This should correspond to the employee_skill table for skill_type='skill'. The function returns skills and wills separately. I only extracted skills.

I printed all skills and their levels. The levels are integers. Some levels are 6, which exceeds the expected 1 to 5 mentioned in the step description. However, the step description says level (1 to 5), but actual data shows level 6. I should use the data as stored, so I kept them as is.

I did not include wills. I used the exact skill names as stored.

I did not use fuzzy search for this retrieval, as instructed.

All facts were explicitly printed from function returns.

I did not call any state-changing functions.

The JSON I provided matches the expected output format: employee_id and skills array with skill_name and level.

I should double-check that the employee_id is correct. In Step 2, we found employee ID FphR_062 for Arianna Orlando. That's what I used.

I also need to ensure I didn't miss any skills. The printed output shows 15 skills.

Thus, I believe Step 3 is complete.

Now, I will provide the final answer and JSON again.
