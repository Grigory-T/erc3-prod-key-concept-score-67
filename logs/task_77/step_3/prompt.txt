Step 3: Retrieve the full list of current skills for the confirmed employee record of Orlando Arianna from the employee_skill table.
Approach: Using the employee_id identified in Step 2, query the employee_skill table for all rows where employee_id equals Orlando's id and skill_type = 'skill'. Do not include 'will' entries for this task, as we focus literally on skills. For each skill, retrieve skill_name and level (1 to 5). If skill names might contain inconsistencies or minor typos, keep them as stored but note exact strings for later matching logic. No fuzzy search is needed for this retrieval itself, but we will consider FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL handling of skill name equivalence in later steps when comparing across employees.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"skill_name":{"type":"string"},"level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["skill_name","level"]}}},"required":["employee_id","skills"]}
