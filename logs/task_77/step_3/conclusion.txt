Step 3 completed as instructed. I retrieved the full list of current skills for employee Arianna Orlando (ID: FphR_062) by calling `get_employee("FphR_062")` and extracting the `skills` attribute from the returned EmployeeFull object. This corresponds to querying the employee_skill table for skill_type='skill'. I printed all 15 skills with their exact names and levels as stored in the system. No wills were included, no fuzzy search was performed, and no state-changing operations were executed. All data was explicitly verified from the function return.

  "employee_id": "FphR_062",

    {"skill_name": "skill_corrosion", "level": 3},
