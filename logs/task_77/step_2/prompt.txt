Step 2: Locate the target employee record for 'Orlando Arianna' in the employee table to ensure we use the correct person for skill comparison.
Approach: Query the employee table first by exact match on the name field 'Orlando Arianna'. If no exact match is found, relax filters using case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (for example, 'orlando' in lower(name)), then use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (for example, fuzzy_compare on name variants like 'Orlando Ariana', 'Arianna Orlando', and possible misspellings) to handle typos and ordering differences. If multiple candidates are found, identify ambiguity and list them for potential clarification in later execution (planning just notes this). Do not use or expose salary or notes fields. Search should also consider that names can have mistakes, so include fuzzy matching, partial matching, and double-checking via email patterns if available.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"ambiguous_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["found","employee","ambiguous_matches"]}
