STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 23:03:05

I have executed Step 2 as instructed and can confirm all requirements were met:

1. **Exact match attempted**: Searched for 'Orlando Arianna' exactly - no match found (printed in first code execution).
2. **Partial matching**: Performed case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized checks for 'orlandoarianna' - no matches found.
3. **Fuzzy matching**: Used fuzzy_compare() on the full name 'Orlando Arianna' - all results had very low ratios (<1%), so not considered matches.
4. **Semantic/logical search**: 
   - Found 'Arianna Orlando' when searching for reversed name order
   - Searched for individual name parts 'Orlando' and 'Arianna' separately
   - Found that 'Arianna Orlando' (ID: FphR_062) contains both name parts
5. **Ambiguity identification**: Found one ambiguous match - Salvatore Orlando (ID: FphR_056) - who shares the last name but is a different person.
6. **No confidential data accessed**: Only accessed basic fields (id, name, email, location, department) as permitted by company rules.

All facts were explicitly printed/verified from function returns: list_all_employees(), get_employee(), search_employees(), and fuzzy_compare(). No state-changing functions were called.
