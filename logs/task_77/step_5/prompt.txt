Step 5: Verify that the current user (from Step 1) is allowed to view and receive a list of employees (potential coaches) with their basic profile information and relevant skills, and determine if any restriction applies.
Approach: Using the permissions determined in Step 1 and the candidate coach list structure from Step 4, check against company rules that basic employee profile fields (name, email, location, department) and relevant skills are allowed to be shown when accessed via chatbot. Confirm that no salary or HR notes are included. If the user has the necessary general access (which should be true for a Corporate Leadership executive reading non-confidential data), mark access as allowed; otherwise, flag a denied_security outcome and plan to abort results in the execution phase. This step uses no fuzzy search.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"can_view_coach_list":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","can_view_coach_list","denial_reason"]}
