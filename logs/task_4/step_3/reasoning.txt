We are in Step 3. We have permission_granted true and selected_project_id is "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation".
 We need to retrieve the team member records and their workload (time_slice) values for the confirmed project.

 Approach:
 1. Use the selected_project_id to get the project details via get_project().
 2. The project object (ProjectFull) contains a team field which is a list of TeamMember objects.
 3. For each TeamMember, extract employee_id, role, and time_slice.
 4. Note: The TeamMember object has an 'employee' field (which is the employee id) and 'role' and 'time_slice'.

 However, note that the TeamMember object has:
   - employee (str): employee id
   - role (str)
   - time_slice (float)

 The expected output requires:
   - project_id (string)
   - team_members (list of objects with employee_id, role, time_slice)
   - has_team_members (boolean)

 Let's do it step by step in code.

We are given the result of the code execution. We have successfully retrieved the team members for the project.
 The project has 3 team members with their respective employee_id, role, and time_slice.

 We need to produce the expected output in the specified JSON format.

 Expected Output format:
 {
   "project_id": string or null,
   "team_members": [
     {
       "employee_id": string,
       "role": string,
       "time_slice": number
     }
   ],
   "has_team_members": boolean
 }

 From the code output:
   project_id: "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation"
   team_members: 
     [
       {"employee_id": "iv5n_020", "role": "Lead", "time_slice": 0.3},
       {"employee_id": "iv5n_044", "role": "Engineer", "time_slice": 0.4},
       {"employee_id": "iv5n_078", "role": "Ops", "time_slice": 0.3}
     ]
   has_team_members: True

 We must note that the project was found and we have team members.

 Let's construct the JSON accordingly.

The user asks for verification of step completion. Let me review what was done.

Step 3: Retrieve team member records and their workload (time_slice) values for the confirmed project.

Approach: If permission_granted is true and selected_project_id is not null, query the team_member table filtered by project_id = selected_project_id. Select the fields project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice for all matching rows. Ensure all rows are included, and do not modify any data. If no rows are found, record that the project has no team members defined.

From previous step: permission_granted = true, selected_project_id = "proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation".

I executed:
- Called `who_am_i()` to confirm user context (though not strictly needed for retrieval, but done).
- Called `get_project(project_id)` to get the project details.
- The project was found, and its `team` attribute contains list of TeamMember objects.
- I iterated over each team member and extracted employee_id (member.employee), role (member.role), time_slice (member.time_slice).
- Printed each member's details.
- Created a list of dictionaries with those three fields.
- Set has_team_members based on length.

Checklist:
- Did I execute the step instruction? Yes: I queried the team_member table via get_project which returns team members. The step says "query the team_member table filtered by project_id". The function `get_project` returns the project with team list. Alternatively, there might be a direct function to query team_members, but I used the available function `get_project` which includes team. That's acceptable because it retrieves the same data.
- Is there any action I skipped or assumed? No, I retrieved all rows (3 members) and did not modify any data.
- Are all facts verified? Yes, I printed the values from the function returns. No assumptions.

JSON response contains only values printed/verified: project_id, team_members with employee_id, role, time_slice, has_team_members.

I did not use any make-up data.

I did not change state; only read operations.

Thus, I believe the step is complete and correct.

I will repeat both <final_answer> and <json> blocks as requested.
