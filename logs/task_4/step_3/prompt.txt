Step 3: Retrieve the team member records and their workload (time_slice) values for the confirmed project.
Approach: If permission_granted is true and selected_project_id is not null, query the team_member table filtered by project_id = selected_project_id. Select the fields project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice for all matching rows. Ensure all rows are included, and do not modify any data. If no rows are found, record that the project has no team members defined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]}},"has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_id","team_members","has_team_members"]}
