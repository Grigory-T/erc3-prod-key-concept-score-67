Step 4: Determine which team member or members have the largest workload (maximum time_slice) on the project.
Approach: From the list of team_members returned in Step 3, compute the maximum time_slice value. Identify all employees whose time_slice equals this maximum value (to handle ties explicitly). Do not perform any further database queries in this step; use only the data already retrieved. If there are no team members, indicate that no maximum can be determined.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"max_time_slice_found":{"type":"boolean"},"max_time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"top_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"total_team_members_considered":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["project_id","max_time_slice_found","max_time_slice","top_employee_ids","total_team_members_considered"]}
