STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 18:57:22

I have verified the execution of Step 5:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I used the list of top_employee_ids from Step 4 (["iv5n_044"]) and queried the employee table with exact matches on id using `get_employee("iv5n_044")`.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: I followed the approach exactly:
   - First attempted exact match on employee ID
   - The exact match was found, so no fuzzy/semantic search was needed (as per the approach: "If any id is not found exactly, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search")
   - Retrieved both the employee ID and name from the verified function return

3. **All facts verified**: The employee identity was confirmed through the function return:
   - Employee ID: "iv5n_044" (exact match)
   - Employee Name: "Rocco D’Amico" (from function return)
   - All values in the JSON output are directly from printed/verified function returns

4. **No state-changing operations**: I only used read operations (`get_employee`), no update functions were called.

The verification confirms that Step 5 was completed correctly according to the specified approach and requirements.
