Step 5: Resolve the identities (human-readable names) of the employee or employees with the biggest workload and prepare the final answer.
Approach: Using the list of top_employee_ids from Step 4, query the employee table with exact matches on id. If any id is not found exactly, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the employee id and name fields to handle possible inconsistencies or typos, following the defined fuzzy matching strategy (substring search, normalization, and fuzzy similarity). For each found employee, retrieve their id and name. Combine this information with the max_time_slice value from Step 4 to construct a final structured result identifying who has (or who have, in case of a tie) the biggest workload on the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"max_time_slice":{"type":["number","null"]},"employees_with_max_workload":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name"]}},"employee_resolution_complete":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["project_id","max_time_slice","employees_with_max_workload","employee_resolution_complete"]}
