STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 18:53:18

I executed Step 2 by performing the following actions:
1. Retrieved the current user context using `who_am_i()` to confirm authentication and department (Finance & Administration).
2. Attempted to read the project data using `get_project()` with the exact project ID from Step 1.
3. Successfully retrieved the project including its team members and their time_slice values, confirming read access.
4. Verified against company rules: No explicit rules restrict Finance & Administration employees from reading project team composition or time_slice values. The restrictions focus on mutation operations, not read access.

All facts were verified through function returns. No state-changing operations were performed. The permission check is based on actual ability to retrieve the data, which indicates permission granted.
