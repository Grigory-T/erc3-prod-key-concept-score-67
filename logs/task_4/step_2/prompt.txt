Step 2: Verify that the current authenticated user 'iv5n_139' (Claudio Fabbri, Finance and Administration, HQ – Italy) has permission to view team workload (time_slice) information for the identified project.
Approach: Using the selected_project_id from Step 1 and the bound identity of the current user (id, department, location, and any system roles from the EmployeeRegistry), perform a who_am_i() style permission and access check against the company’s access control rules for reading project and team_member data. Confirm whether a Finance and Administration department employee is allowed to read project team composition and time_slice values for this specific project. Do not attempt any write operation; only verify read access. If the rules or roles indicate insufficient permission, mark access as denied.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"permission_checked_for_user_id":{"type":"string"},"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["selected_project_id","permission_checked_for_user_id","permission_granted","denial_reason"]}
