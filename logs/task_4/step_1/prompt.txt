Step 1: Identify and confirm the target project record corresponding to the reference 'proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation' in the project table.
Approach: Query the project table to find the project using an exact match on the id field 'proj_machina_press_line_rationalisation'. If an exact match is not found, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on both the id and name fields, explicitly accounting for potential typos, misspellings, partial matches, and variations (for example, using lowercase normalization, substring search, regular expressions, and fuzzy similarity scoring). If multiple candidates are found, rank them by match score and select the best candidate if it is clearly above others; otherwise, mark the situation as ambiguous.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"match_type":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name","match_score","match_type"]}}},"required":["project_found","selected_project_id","matched_projects"]}
