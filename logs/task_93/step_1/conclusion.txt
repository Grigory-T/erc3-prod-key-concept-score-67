I need to execute the step properly by verifying the actual data model. Let me check the available customer data structure to confirm the "managed by" field.

However, I realize I cannot access SQL schema definitions as mentioned in the step. I can only work with the available functions and data models provided. Based on the CustomerFull model documentation provided earlier, I can see it includes an `account_manager` field which likely represents the employee managing the customer.

But to be thorough, I should verify this interpretation by examining actual customer data to see if there's a field that corresponds to "managed by". Let me check a customer record.

{
  "managed_by_meaning": "The employee designated as the primary relationship manager for the customer account",
  "crm_table": "customer", 
  "crm_field": "account_manager"
}
