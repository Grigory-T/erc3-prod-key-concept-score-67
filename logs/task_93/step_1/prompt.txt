Step 1: Interpret the business phrase "customers managed by X" in terms of the available data model to determine which table and column represent "managed by".
Approach: Review the provided SQL schema definitions (especially the customer table) to map the phrase "customers managed either by Erik Blom or Anna Fischer" to a concrete database representation. Specifically, identify that a "managed" customer is one where the employee is stored as the account manager, i.e., customer.account_manager references employee.id. Confirm this interpretation logically using the schema relationships, with no external data access needed. This is an understanding step only, no queries are run.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"managed_by_meaning":{"type":"string"},"crm_table":{"type":"string"},"crm_field":{"type":"string"}},"required":["managed_by_meaning","crm_table","crm_field"]}
