Step 5: Prepare and present the final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer, clearly grouped or annotated by which manager each customer belongs to.
Approach: From the result set of step 4, construct a response object that shows all customers where customer.account_manager equals the employee_id of either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer. Optionally group customers by manager or include a field specifying which manager (by name and employee_id) manages each customer. Ensure there are no duplicates and that only non-sensitive customer fields are exposed. The output should be ready to display directly to the user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"managers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]}},"customers_by_manager":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_id":{"type":"string"},"account_manager_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","account_manager_id","account_manager_name"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["managers","customers_by_manager","total_customers"]}
