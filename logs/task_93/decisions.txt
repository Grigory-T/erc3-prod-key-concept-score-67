DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:13:56
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has produced the expected output and matches the plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing data. The next step is to find the employee records for Erik Blom and Anna Fischer using fuzzy/semantic matching as described. All required context and logic is present to proceed. No replanning or abort is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:16:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully according to the original plan. Both target account managers have been identified with high-confidence matches and their employee IDs are available. There have been no errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected results. Step 3, which is to validate user permissions for the next data access, is up next. The original plan is still fully viable, and there is no need to replan. According to the task's rules, the workflow should continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:18:14
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All executed steps have succeeded as expected according to the plan. The current state matches the original plan with no missing information, errors, or policy violations. The remaining steps are straightforward, require no re-planning, and the goal remains attainable with the next actions exactly as described. Therefore, the plan should proceed directly to Step 4.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:20:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have executed correctly and produced the expected results according to the original plan. The necessary employee records have been found for both requested managers, access permissions for customer data have been confirmed, and all relevant customer records have been collected. Step 5, which involves formatting and presenting the results, remains. There is no missing data, exception, or inconsistency that would warrant replanning. The plan remains valid and should continue as originally written.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:23:33
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps of the original plan have been successfully executed with the expected outputs at each stage. The final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer has been prepared and all required data has been collected and presented. There are no remaining steps and no discrepancies; the plan's goal is fully satisfied according to the original instructions and company policies.
