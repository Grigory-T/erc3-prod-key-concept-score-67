Step 2: Identify employee records for "Erik Blom" and "Anna Fischer" in the employee table, handling possible typos, different capitalizations, and partial names using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search.
Approach: Query the employee table to find rows whose name field matches the target names. First attempt exact matches on employee.name = 'Erik Blom' and employee.name = 'Anna Fischer'. If any are not found, relax the search following the mandatory search strategy: use case-insensitive containment checks (e.g., 'erik' and 'blom' in lowercased name), then try partial word or regular expression matches, and then apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to handle minor typos or variations like 'Eric Bloom' or 'Ana Fischer'. Use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to ensure that first name and last name associations are consistent when multiple similar hits exist. For each of the two target names, select the best matching employee record, if any, and record their employee.id and name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"input_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["input_name","employee_id","matched_name","match_confidence"]}},"all_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["target_employees","all_found"]}
