Step 4: Retrieve all customers whose account_manager is either the employee_id of Erik Blom or the employee_id of Anna Fischer from the customer table.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and at least one employee_id was found, run a SELECT query on the customer table filtered by customer.account_manager IN (<erik_employee_id>, <anna_employee_id>), excluding any null account_manager values. If only one of the two employee_ids was found in step 2, filter by the one that exists. The search uses exact matching on account_manager, as employee_id is a primary key. Collect all matching customer rows and extract relevant non-sensitive fields such as id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, and primary_contact_email.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"queried_manager_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_email":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","account_manager"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["queried_manager_ids","customers","total_customers"]}
