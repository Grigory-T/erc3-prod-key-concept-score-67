STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

I have successfully executed Step 3 by checking the current user's identity and permissions to read customer data. The verification confirms:

1. I called `who_am_i()` to get the current user context - this was explicitly executed and printed.
2. I verified the user is authenticated (is_public=False) and belongs to Corporate Leadership department.
3. I reviewed the company rules and confirmed there are no restrictions on reading customer data for authenticated employees. The rules only restrict mutation operations (CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase) to specific roles.
4. The user's department (Corporate Leadership) indicates executive-level access, which aligns with the verification rules stating executives can access client information.

All facts were verified from function returns: the user identity was obtained from `who_am_i()`, and permission analysis was based on the explicitly provided company rules. No state was changed during this step.

No actions were skipped or assumed - all verification was based on actual function returns and the provided company rules.
