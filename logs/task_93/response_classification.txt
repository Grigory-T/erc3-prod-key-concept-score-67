## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Interpret the business phrase "customers managed by X" in terms of the available data model to determine which table and column represent "managed by".
Approach: Review the provided SQL schema definitions (especially the customer table) to map the phrase "customers managed either by Erik Blom or Anna Fischer" to a concrete database representation. Specifically, identify that a "managed" customer is one where the employee is stored as the account manager, i.e., customer.account_manager references employee.id. Confirm this interpretation logically using the schema relationships, with no external data access needed. This is an understanding step only, no queries are run.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"managed_by_meaning":{"type":"string"},"crm_table":{"type":"string"},"crm_field":{"type":"string"}},"required":["managed_by_meaning","crm_table","crm_field"]}
**Result:** I need to execute the step properly by verifying the actual data model. Let me check the available customer data structure to confirm the "managed by" field.

However, I realize I cannot access SQL schema definitions as mentioned in the step. I can only work with the available functions and data models provided. Based on the CustomerFull model documentation provided earlier, I can see it includes an `account_manager` field which likely represents the employee managing the customer.

But to be thorough, I should verify this interpretation by examining actual customer data to see if there's a field that corresponds to "managed by". Let me check a customer record.

{
  "managed_by_meaning": "The employee designated as the primary relationship manager for the customer account",
  "crm_table": "customer", 
  "crm_field": "account_manager"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify employee records for "Erik Blom" and "Anna Fischer" in the employee table, handling possible typos, different capitalizations, and partial names using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search.
Approach: Query the employee table to find rows whose name field matches the target names. First attempt exact matches on employee.name = 'Erik Blom' and employee.name = 'Anna Fischer'. If any are not found, relax the search following the mandatory search strategy: use case-insensitive containment checks (e.g., 'erik' and 'blom' in lowercased name), then try partial word or regular expression matches, and then apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to handle minor typos or variations like 'Eric Bloom' or 'Ana Fischer'. Use SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to ensure that first name and last name associations are consistent when multiple similar hits exist. For each of the two target names, select the best matching employee record, if any, and record their employee.id and name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"input_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["input_name","employee_id","matched_name","match_confidence"]}},"all_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["target_employees","all_found"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 2. Both employees were found with exact matches:
- Erik Blom: Employee ID FphR_025, works in Sales & Customer Success department at Rotterdam Office – Netherlands
- Anna Fischer: Employee ID FphR_034, works in Sales & Customer Success department at Vienna Office – Austria

The search strategy was followed: exact matches were attempted first and found, so no fuzzy or semantic matching was required. Both employees were verified by retrieving their full records to confirm identities.

{
  "target_employees": [
    {
      "input_name": "Erik Blom",
      "employee_id": "FphR_025",
      "matched_name": "Erik Blom",
      "match_confidence": 1.0
    },
    {
      "input_name": "Anna Fischer",
      "employee_id": "FphR_034",
      "matched_name": "Anna Fischer",
      "match_confidence": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "all_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check current user identity and permissions to ensure that the acting user (Nino Valente, id FphR_001) is allowed to read customer data associated with the identified account managers.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user context (id 'FphR_001', department 'Corporate Leadership', location 'HQ – Italy'). Using the bound system roles and the company rules, verify that reading customer records from the CRM (customer table) does not require special roles (only mutations like CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, or ChangeDealPhase do). Confirm that there are no salary or confidential HR fields involved and that the access is read-only. Set a flag indicating whether the current user is permitted to list customers for the previously resolved employee_ids.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","location","can_read_customers","denial_reason"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 by checking the current user's identity and permissions to read customer data. The verification confirms:

1. I called `who_am_i()` to get the current user context - this was explicitly executed and printed.
2. I verified the user is authenticated (is_public=False) and belongs to Corporate Leadership department.
3. I reviewed the company rules and confirmed there are no restrictions on reading customer data for authenticated employees. The rules only restrict mutation operations (CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase) to specific roles.
4. The user's department (Corporate Leadership) indicates executive-level access, which aligns with the verification rules stating executives can access client information.

All facts were verified from function returns: the user identity was obtained from `who_am_i()`, and permission analysis was based on the explicitly provided company rules. No state was changed during this step.

No actions were skipped or assumed - all verification was based on actual function returns and the provided company rules.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all customers whose account_manager is either the employee_id of Erik Blom or the employee_id of Anna Fischer from the customer table.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and at least one employee_id was found, run a SELECT query on the customer table filtered by customer.account_manager IN (<erik_employee_id>, <anna_employee_id>), excluding any null account_manager values. If only one of the two employee_ids was found in step 2, filter by the one that exists. The search uses exact matching on account_manager, as employee_id is a primary key. Collect all matching customer rows and extract relevant non-sensitive fields such as id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, and primary_contact_email.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"queried_manager_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_email":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","account_manager"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["queried_manager_ids","customers","total_customers"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 by retrieving all customers whose account_manager is either Erik Blom (employee_id: FphR_025) or Anna Fischer (employee_id: FphR_034). I used the search_customers function with account_managers filter and paginated through all results to collect complete customer information. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns - I printed each customer record as it was retrieved. No data was invented or assumed. No state was changed during this step (only read operations). A total of 6 customers were found: 4 managed by FphR_025 and 2 managed by FphR_034.

    }
  ],
  "total_customers": 6
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare and present the final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer, clearly grouped or annotated by which manager each customer belongs to.
Approach: From the result set of step 4, construct a response object that shows all customers where customer.account_manager equals the employee_id of either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer. Optionally group customers by manager or include a field specifying which manager (by name and employee_id) manages each customer. Ensure there are no duplicates and that only non-sensitive customer fields are exposed. The output should be ready to display directly to the user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"managers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]}},"customers_by_manager":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_id":{"type":"string"},"account_manager_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","account_manager_id","account_manager_name"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["managers","customers_by_manager","total_customers"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I have prepared and presented the final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer, clearly annotated with which manager each customer belongs to. All data was verified from function returns: manager information from Step 2, customer data retrieved via search_customers and get_customer functions. The output includes 2 managers and 6 total customers (4 managed by Erik Blom, 2 by Anna Fischer), with all required customer fields. No state was changed during this step.

**Result:** Successfully executed Step 2. Both employees were found with exact matches:
- Erik Blom: Employee ID FphR_025, works in Sales & Customer Success department at Rotterdam Office – Netherlands
- Anna Fischer: Employee ID FphR_034, works in Sales & Customer Success department at Vienna Office – Austria

The search strategy was followed: exact matches were attempted first and found, so no fuzzy or semantic matching was required. Both employees were verified by retrieving their full records to confirm identities.

      "match_confidence": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "all_found": true
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check current user identity and permissions to ensure that the acting user (Nino Valente, id FphR_001) is allowed to read customer data associated with the identified account managers.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user context (id 'FphR_001', department 'Corporate Leadership', location 'HQ – Italy'). Using the bound system roles and the company rules, verify that reading customer records from the CRM (customer table) does not require special roles (only mutations like CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, or ChangeDealPhase do). Confirm that there are no salary or confidential HR fields involved and that the access is read-only. Set a flag indicating whether the current user is permitted to list customers for the previously resolved employee_ids.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_read_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","location","can_read_customers","denial_reason"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 by checking the current user's identity and permissions to read customer data. The verification confirms:

1. I called `who_am_i()` to get the current user context - this was explicitly executed and printed.
2. I verified the user is authenticated (is_public=False) and belongs to Corporate Leadership department.
3. I reviewed the company rules and confirmed there are no restrictions on reading customer data for authenticated employees. The rules only restrict mutation operations (CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase) to specific roles.
4. The user's department (Corporate Leadership) indicates executive-level access, which aligns with the verification rules stating executives can access client information.

All facts were verified from function returns: the user identity was obtained from `who_am_i()`, and permission analysis was based on the explicitly provided company rules. No state was changed during this step.

No actions were skipped or assumed - all verification was based on actual function returns and the provided company rules.

{
  "user_id": "FphR_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "can_read_customers": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve all customers whose account_manager is either the employee_id of Erik Blom or the employee_id of Anna Fischer from the customer table.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and at least one employee_id was found, run a SELECT query on the customer table filtered by customer.account_manager IN (<erik_employee_id>, <anna_employee_id>), excluding any null account_manager values. If only one of the two employee_ids was found in step 2, filter by the one that exists. The search uses exact matching on account_manager, as employee_id is a primary key. Collect all matching customer rows and extract relevant non-sensitive fields such as id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, and primary_contact_email.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"queried_manager_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"customers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"primary_contact_email":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","account_manager"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["queried_manager_ids","customers","total_customers"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 by retrieving all customers whose account_manager is either Erik Blom (employee_id: FphR_025) or Anna Fischer (employee_id: FphR_034). I used the search_customers function with account_managers filter and paginated through all results to collect complete customer information. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns - I printed each customer record as it was retrieved. No data was invented or assumed. No state was changed during this step (only read operations). A total of 6 customers were found: 4 managed by FphR_025 and 2 managed by FphR_034.

    }
  ],
  "total_customers": 6
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Prepare and present the final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer, clearly grouped or annotated by which manager each customer belongs to.
Approach: From the result set of step 4, construct a response object that shows all customers where customer.account_manager equals the employee_id of either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer. Optionally group customers by manager or include a field specifying which manager (by name and employee_id) manages each customer. Ensure there are no duplicates and that only non-sensitive customer fields are exposed. The output should be ready to display directly to the user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"managers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name"]}},"customers_by_manager":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":["string","null"]},"deal_phase":{"type":["string","null"]},"high_level_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"account_manager_id":{"type":"string"},"account_manager_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","account_manager_id","account_manager_name"]}},"total_customers":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["managers","customers_by_manager","total_customers"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I have prepared and presented the final list of customers managed by either Erik Blom or Anna Fischer, clearly annotated with which manager each customer belongs to. All data was verified from function returns: manager information from Step 2, customer data retrieved via search_customers and get_customer functions. The output includes 2 managers and 6 total customers (4 managed by Erik Blom, 2 by Anna Fischer), with all required customer fields. No state was changed during this step.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-17
Current actor: Authenticated user FphR_001
User details: {"id": "FphR_001", "name": "Nino Valente", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
