STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 19:51:55

I have successfully executed Step 5 by computing the total workload for each "Production – Italy" employee based on time slices across all projects. All data was explicitly verified from function returns:

1. **Employee Identification**: Used the exact 32 employee IDs from Step 3 for "Production – Italy" department.

2. **Project Data Collection**: Retrieved all 36 company projects through paginated API calls (5 projects per request).

3. **Workload Calculation**: For each project, examined the team members and summed time_slice values for employees in the target group.

4. **Verification**: Cross-checked results by:
   - Processing all 36 projects completely
   - Performing sample verification on 3 employees (BwFV_054, BwFV_055, BwFV_056)
   - Comparing aggregated totals with direct project searches for those employees

5. **Matching Strategy**: Used exact matching on employee identifiers (no inconsistencies or misspellings found). No fuzzy or semantic matching was required as all employee IDs matched exactly.

The analysis reveals that only 10 out of 32 Production – Italy employees have project assignments, with total_time_slice ranging from 0.0 to 0.5. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations.
