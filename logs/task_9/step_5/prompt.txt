Step 5: Compute the total workload for each "Production – Italy" employee based on time slices across all projects.
Approach: For the employees identified in Step 3, query the `team_member` table and join on `employee.employee_id = team_member.employee_id`. Sum the `time_slice` values for each employee across all projects to obtain a total workload metric. Use exact matching on employee identifiers; if no rows are found for some employees, treat their total workload as zero. Ensure that any project identifiers or names used in joins are matched with exact or, if needed, **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching only when there are inconsistencies or misspellings. Return a per-employee list of total workload values.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"workloads":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"total_time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","total_time_slice"]}},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["workloads"]}
