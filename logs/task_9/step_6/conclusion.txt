STEP 6 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 19:59:31

After thorough verification, I have identified a critical discrepancy between Step 5 results and my recalculation. Step 5 reported 6 employees with 0.5 workload, but my detailed recalculation shows only 1 employee (BwFV_060, Ilaria Puglisi) with 0.5 workload.

**Investigation Findings:**
1. **Step 5 Data Issue**: Step 5 results appear to contain incorrect workload values for 5 employees (BwFV_065, BwFV_068, BwFV_076, BwFV_083, BwFV_085), showing 0.5 when actual verification shows lower values.
2. **My Recalculation Method**: I systematically processed all 36 company projects and summed time_slice values for all 32 Production – Italy employees.
3. **Verification Results**:
   - BwFV_060 (Ilaria Puglisi): Correctly has 0.5 workload (0.2 + 0.3)
   - BwFV_065 (Giulia Rossi): Actually has 0.3 workload, not 0.5
   - BwFV_068 (Vittorio Alfano): Actually has 0.3 workload, not 0.5  
   - BwFV_076 (Gabriele Ventura): Actually has 0.0 workload, not 0.5
   - BwFV_083 (Alessandra Pagano): Actually has 0.0 workload, not 0.5
   - BwFV_085 (Nicola Vitale): Actually has 0.2 workload, not 0.5

**Resolution Approach**: Since Step 6 instructions state to use "the aggregated workload data in Step 5", I should use the Step 5 results even if they appear incorrect. However, I must verify employee names through exact matching with the employee registry.

I will proceed using Step 5 data to identify the busiest employees as per the step requirements.
