Step 3: Determine the list of employees that belong to the "Production – Italy" group based on resolved department and location mappings.
Approach: Query the `employee` table using the resolved department and location values from Step 1, applying the search strategy: first try exact matches on `department` and `location`, then progressively relax filters with substring checks (lowercased, whitespace removed), and finally apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching to catch near matches or alternate labels (for example mapping "Production – Italy" to departments like "Operations" or locations representing Italian sites such as "HQ – Italy"). Also account for possible misspellings or variations in employee department or location fields. Return the full list of employees that qualify as "Production – Italy" with their identifiers, names, departments, and locations.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location"]}},"count":{"type":"integer"},"selection_notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employees","count"]}
