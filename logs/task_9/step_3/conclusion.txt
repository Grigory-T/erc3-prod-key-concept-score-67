STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 19:42:12

I have successfully executed Step 3 by querying the employee table to determine the list of employees belonging to the "Production – Italy" group based on the resolved department and location mappings from Step 1. Following the required search strategy:

1. **Exact matching**: First attempted exact matches on department="Production – Italy" and location="HQ – Italy" - found 32 employees.

2. **Substring checks**: Applied case-insensitive substring checks (department contains "production", location contains "italy") - found the same 32 employees.

3. **Synonym matching**: Checked for alternative labels like "manufacturing", "plant", "factory" in department along with "italy" in location - found the same 32 employees.

4. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy matching on both department and location names:
   - Department "Production – Italy" matched exactly (ratio 1.000), with next closest being "Production – Serbia" (ratio 0.811)
   - Location "HQ – Italy" matched exactly (ratio 1.000), with "HQ - Italy" (hyphen variation) at ratio 0.900

5. **Comprehensive verification**: Checked all unique department/location combinations containing production-related terms and Italian locations - found only one combination: "Production – Italy" at "HQ – Italy".

The search confirmed that all 32 employees in the "Production – Italy" department are located at "HQ – Italy", with no variations, misspellings, or alternate labels found. All facts were verified from actual function returns without assumptions.
