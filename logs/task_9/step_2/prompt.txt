Step 2: Identify the concrete technical data sources (tables, fields, or services) needed to determine employees in "Production – Italy" and their workloads based on time slices.
Approach: Using the available SQL schema and any internal technical documentation, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for entities related to employees, departments, locations, team memberships, workload, and time slices. Specifically confirm that the `employee` table holds department and location, and the `team_member` table holds workload via the `time_slice` field, and that no other internal service or API overrides these as the source of truth. Record the identified tables and fields that will be queried.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"data_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"key_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["data_sources","key_fields","found"]}
