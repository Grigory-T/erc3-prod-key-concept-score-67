I have executed Step 2 by performing a comprehensive search of the company's technical documentation and available data sources. Here's what was verified:

1. **Documentation Analysis**: Examined systems documentation including:
   - `systems/employee_registry.md` - Confirmed employee table stores: Employee ID, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills, wills
   - `systems/project_registry.md` - Confirmed project team structure includes: employee assignments, roles, and time_slice (fraction of FTE)
   - `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md` - Confirmed time tracking is for actual hours, not workload allocation

2. **Specific Technical Confirmation**:
   - Employee department and location are stored in the employee registry (explicitly documented)
   - Workload via time_slice is stored in the project registry's team assignments (explicitly documented: "Their approximate time slice (fraction of an FTE)")
   - Documentation states: "when estimating workload (e.g. who is busiest or non-busiest), we rely on workload time slices via Project registry"

3. **Function Verification**:
   - `list_employees()` and `get_employee()` return department and location fields
   - `get_project()` returns team members with time_slice values
   - No other services override these as source of truth - documentation confirms these are "system of record"

4. **Search Strategy Applied**:
   - Fuzzy search for "time_slice", "team_member", "workload"
   - Regex search for technical terms
   - Examination of all systems documentation files
   - Testing actual data access patterns

All facts were verified from actual function returns and documentation content. No assumptions were made.

{
  "data_sources": ["employee_registry", "project_registry"],
  "key_fields": ["employee.id", "employee.department", "employee.location", "team_member.employee", "team_member.time_slice", "team_member.role"],
  "found": true,
  "notes": "Verified through documentation and function testing: Employee registry holds department/location; Project registry holds team assignments with time_slice workload allocations. Documentation explicitly states workload estimation uses time_slice from Project Registry, not time tracking system."
}
