The investigation successfully clarified the meaning of "Production – Italy" through comprehensive analysis:

1. **Wiki Search**: Used fuzzy search with terms like "Production", "Manufacturing", "Plant", "Factory", "Italy" and regex patterns like "Production.*Italy". Found exact matches in `company/organization_and_hierarchy.md` and `hr/people_and_roles.md` showing "Production – Italy" as a department with 32 employees.

2. **Employee Data Verification**: Examined all 154 employees. Found 32 employees with department "Production – Italy", all located at "HQ – Italy". No employees in this department were at other locations.

3. **Department Structure Analysis**: Verified unique departments include "Production – Italy" and "Production – Serbia" as separate departments. No other production-related department names exist in Italian locations.

4. **Location Confirmation**: All "Production – Italy" employees are at "HQ – Italy" location (not "HQ - Italy" with hyphen variation).

The term "Production – Italy" is an exact department name in the company's data structure, not a combination of multiple departments or a reporting group. This is explicitly documented and verified in actual employee records.
