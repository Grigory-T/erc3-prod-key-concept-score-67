Step 1: Clarify the meaning of the term "Production – Italy" and how it maps to actual department and location values in company data.
Approach: Search internal wiki and company documentation for the term "Production – Italy" using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search (also accounting for possible misspellings, partial matches, abbreviations, and synonyms like "Production", "Manufacturing", "Plant", "Factory", "HQ – Italy"). Confirm whether "Production – Italy" corresponds to a specific department name, a combination of department and location (for example production-related department at Italian sites), or a group definition used in reporting. If no exact match is found, use fuzzy matching and logical inference (for example mapping to departments such as "Operations" at Italian locations) and document the resolved mapping and confidence level.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"resolved_group_label":{"type":"string"},"resolved_department_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"resolved_location_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"confidence":{"type":"number"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["resolved_group_label","resolved_department_values","resolved_location_values","found"]}
