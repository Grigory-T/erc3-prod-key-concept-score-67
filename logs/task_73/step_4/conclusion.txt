Step 4 has been completed successfully. I counted the number of distinct projects each employee participates in by querying the team_member table through the search_projects function with the team_employee filter. The search included projects of all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) as specified in the task requirements. The results show that Gonzalo Bravo participates in 2 distinct projects, while Emma Lefèvre participates in 1 distinct project.

The search was performed by:
1. Using the exact employee IDs from Step 3: Gonzalo Bravo (Bhwa_031) and Emma Lefèvre (Bhwa_024)
2. Querying the project registry with the team_employee filter to find all projects where each employee is a team member
3. Collecting all distinct project IDs for each employee through pagination (limit 5 per request)
4. Counting the total distinct projects for each employee

No state-changing functions were called in this step - only read operations were performed to count project participation.

  "gonzalo_employee_id": "Bhwa_031",
  "gonzalo_project_count": 2,
  "emma_employee_id": "Bhwa_024",
