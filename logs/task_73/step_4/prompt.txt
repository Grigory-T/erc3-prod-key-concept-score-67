Step 4: Count how many distinct projects each identified employee participates in by querying the team_member table and aggregating by project_id.
Approach: Using the employee identifiers obtained in Step 3 (gonzalo_employee_id and emma_employee_id), query the team_member table for rows where employee_id equals each target employee. Account for potential data quality issues by ensuring that the employee_id filters are exact matches, but if necessary, confirm that any inconsistent capitalization is handled by normalizing both sides. From the resulting rows for each employee, compute the number of distinct project_id values to determine the count of projects in which Gonzalo participates and the count of projects in which Emma participates. Do not filter by project status, since the task does not request that; include projects regardless of status (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). If an employee has no team_member rows, treat their project count as zero.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"gonzalo_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"gonzalo_project_count":{"type":"integer"},"emma_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"emma_project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["gonzalo_employee_id","gonzalo_project_count","emma_employee_id","emma_project_count"]}
