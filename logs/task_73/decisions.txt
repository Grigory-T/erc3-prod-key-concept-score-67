DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:45:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The information from Step 1 shows that the current authenticated user was successfully identified and the required fields (except for system_roles, which is not provided by the API) were obtained. The remaining steps in the original plan are still valid and can proceed as written; no output in Step 1 creates an unresolvable block or deviation from the plan. There is no need to replan, abort, or finalize yet, as the next step is a straightforward permissions check that can be performed with the available data.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:48:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have been conducted according to the original plan. So far, all actions have returned expected and correct results. User identity is confirmed and permissions are granted for the intended read access. There have been no unexpected results or blockers, and there is no indication that the strategy should change. The next step, Step 3, should proceed as planned to resolve employee records for 'Gonzalo Bravo' and 'Emma Lefèvre.' No replanning is needed at this point.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:52:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps were executed exactly as planned and have returned correct and expected results according to the plan. The functions and data in use worked as intended, and we have the correct employee IDs for both Gonzalo and Emma with no ambiguities. There are no inconsistencies or missing information that require replanning. The next step—counting project participation for these employees—is feasible and aligns with the original plan using the obtained employee IDs.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:54:35
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been executed exactly according to the original plan, with results matching expected outputs. Step 4 produced clear, correct data for both employees: Gonzalo Bravo participates in 2 projects and Emma Lefèvre in 1 project. Step 5 is a simple comparison with no ambiguity or additional searching required. The task's final answer depends solely on these results, so the task is complete.
