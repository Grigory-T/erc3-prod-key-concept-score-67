I have verified the execution of Step 3. The step was completed exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed all required search strategies**:
   - Exact match on full name strings (including diacritics)
   - Case-insensitive containment checks on normalized names
   - Fuzzy matching using fuzzy_compare on employee names
   - Partial name search (searching by name parts)
   - ID search (checking if names appear in employee IDs)

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Retrieved all 154 employees via `list_all_employees()`
   - Found exact matches for both employees in the first search strategy
   - Confirmed with fuzzy matching (ratio 1.00 for both)
   - No other candidate employees were found with any search method

3. **No assumptions made**:
   - All data comes directly from function returns
   - No make-up data or sensible defaults used
   - No state-changing functions were called (only read operations)

4. **Results verification**:
   - Gonzalo Bravo: ID "Bhwa_031", name "Gonzalo Bravo" (exact match)
   - Emma Lefèvre: ID "Bhwa_024", name "Emma Lefèvre" (exact match)
   - Both employees found: true
   - Ambiguity notes: Updated to accurately reflect that there were no ambiguous matches (multiple search strategies returned the same employee)

The step has been fully executed according to the instructions.
