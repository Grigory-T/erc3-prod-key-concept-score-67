## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-12-26
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_001
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: Bhwa_001
department: Corporate Leadership
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-12-26
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** I need to pick employee of the month. Who participates in more projects: Gonzalo Bravo or Emma Lefèvre? Link only the employee that has more or both, if they are tied

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Viola Messina, id Bhwa_001) and retrieve her department, location, and system roles using a who_am_i() style lookup in the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session service (for example, who_am_i() in the EmployeeRegistry or authentication layer) to obtain the full bound identity of the current user, including employee_id, department, location, and system_roles. This step does not require any fuzzy or semantic search because the current user context is already bound. Use the returned information as the basis for subsequent permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 as instructed by calling the `who_am_i()` function to identify the current authenticated user and retrieve her bound identity. I obtained the employee_id, department, and location directly from the `who_am_i()` response, and retrieved the name from the `get_employee()` function. However, after thorough verification, I confirmed that the current API does not provide access to system_roles information through either `who_am_i()` or `get_employee()` functions. The system_roles field is not present in the returned objects. Therefore, I cannot retrieve system_roles as requested, but I have successfully retrieved all other required information that is available through the provided functions.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "name": "Viola Messina",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to ensure she is allowed to read employee and project participation data (employee, project, and team_member tables).
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), perform a permission evaluation against internal authorization rules: confirm that reading from employee, project, and team_member tables is allowed for this user. Since only write operations on sensitive fields (like salary, hr_notes) and certain CRM/Project mutations are restricted, and this task only requires reading non-sensitive fields and aggregate counts, conclude whether read access is permitted. If internal policy documentation or wiki pages for access control are available, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search there (for example, search for terms like "data access policy", "project visibility", "employee project participation") to double-check that a Corporate Leadership user can view project team membership. Do not proceed with later steps if this permission check fails.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["permission_granted","reason"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 2 was executed correctly. I performed all required actions: retrieved user identity, conducted fuzzy and semantic searches in wiki documentation, analyzed company rules, and evaluated permissions. The user Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) in Corporate Leadership department has permission to read employee and project participation data for this task, as confirmed by company rules allowing executive access and no restrictions found in policy documentation.

{
  "permission_granted": true,
  "reason": "User Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) is in Corporate Leadership department, which has executive-level access according to company rules. The task requires reading non-sensitive employee data (name, department, location) and project team membership data to count project participation. Company rules allow all employees to read basic employee fields via chatbot, and executives have broader access to project and client information. No access restrictions were found in policy documentation that would deny this read access."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Locate the employee records for "Gonzalo Bravo" and "Emma Lefèvre" in the employee table, resolving possible misspellings, diacritics, and variations using fuzzy and semantic search if needed.
Approach: Query the employee table to find records whose name field matches the input names. First, attempt an exact match on the full name string for "Gonzalo Bravo" and for "Emma Lefèvre" (including proper handling of diacritics). If an exact match is not found for either name, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive containment checks on normalized names (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed), and if still not found, apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name, fuzzy_find_in_text over the employee name index) to account for typos, alternate spellings, or missing accents (e.g., treating "Lefevre" ~ "Lefèvre"). If multiple candidate employees are returned above a confidence threshold, select the best match per name based on highest similarity score; if ties or ambiguities remain, mark the situation in the output. For each resolved employee, retrieve at minimum id and name; do not access or return salary or other restricted fields.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"gonzalo_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"gonzalo_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"emma_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"emma_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"both_found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["gonzalo_employee_id","gonzalo_employee_name","emma_employee_id","emma_employee_name","both_found","ambiguity_notes"]}

I'll execute Step 3 to locate the employee records for "Gonzalo Bravo" and "Emma Lefèvre" using the specified search approach.

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 3 to locate the employee records for "Gonzalo Bravo" and "Emma Lefèvre". Both employees were found with exact matches in the employee database. The search employed multiple strategies including exact matching, case-insensitive containment, fuzzy matching, partial name search, and ID search. Both employees were identified unambiguously with no other candidate matches found.

Gonzalo Bravo was found with employee ID "Bhwa_031" and Emma Lefèvre was found with employee ID "Bhwa_024". Both employees exist in the system and were located without any ambiguity.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Locate the employee records for "Gonzalo Bravo" and "Emma Lefèvre" in the employee table, resolving possible misspellings, diacritics, and variations using fuzzy and semantic search if needed.
Approach: Query the employee table to find records whose name field matches the input names. First, attempt an exact match on the full name string for "Gonzalo Bravo" and for "Emma Lefèvre" (including proper handling of diacritics). If an exact match is not found for either name, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive containment checks on normalized names (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed), and if still not found, apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching (for example, fuzzy_compare on name, fuzzy_find_in_text over the employee name index) to account for typos, alternate spellings, or missing accents (e.g., treating "Lefevre" ~ "Lefèvre"). If multiple candidate employees are returned above a confidence threshold, select the best match per name based on highest similarity score; if ties or ambiguities remain, mark the situation in the output. For each resolved employee, retrieve at minimum id and name; do not access or return salary or other restricted fields.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"gonzalo_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"gonzalo_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"emma_employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"emma_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"both_found":{"type":"boolean"},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["gonzalo_employee_id","gonzalo_employee_name","emma_employee_id","emma_employee_name","both_found","ambiguity_notes"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have verified the execution of Step 3. The step was completed exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed all required search strategies**:
   - Exact match on full name strings (including diacritics)
   - Case-insensitive containment checks on normalized names
   - Fuzzy matching using fuzzy_compare on employee names
   - Partial name search (searching by name parts)
   - ID search (checking if names appear in employee IDs)

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Retrieved all 154 employees via `list_all_employees()`
   - Found exact matches for both employees in the first search strategy
   - Confirmed with fuzzy matching (ratio 1.00 for both)
   - No other candidate employees were found with any search method

3. **No assumptions made**:
   - All data comes directly from function returns
   - No make-up data or sensible defaults used
   - No state-changing functions were called (only read operations)

4. **Results verification**:
   - Gonzalo Bravo: ID "Bhwa_031", name "Gonzalo Bravo" (exact match)
   - Emma Lefèvre: ID "Bhwa_024", name "Emma Lefèvre" (exact match)
   - Both employees found: true
   - Ambiguity notes: Updated to accurately reflect that there were no ambiguous matches (multiple search strategies returned the same employee)

The step has been fully executed according to the instructions.
