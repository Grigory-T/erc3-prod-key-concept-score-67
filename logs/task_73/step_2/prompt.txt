Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to ensure she is allowed to read employee and project participation data (employee, project, and team_member tables).
Approach: Using the identity information from Step 1 (employee_id, department, system_roles), perform a permission evaluation against internal authorization rules: confirm that reading from employee, project, and team_member tables is allowed for this user. Since only write operations on sensitive fields (like salary, hr_notes) and certain CRM/Project mutations are restricted, and this task only requires reading non-sensitive fields and aggregate counts, conclude whether read access is permitted. If internal policy documentation or wiki pages for access control are available, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search there (for example, search for terms like "data access policy", "project visibility", "employee project participation") to double-check that a Corporate Leadership user can view project team membership. Do not proceed with later steps if this permission check fails.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permission_granted":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["permission_granted","reason"]}
