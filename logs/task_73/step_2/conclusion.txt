I have verified that Step 2 was executed correctly. I performed all required actions: retrieved user identity, conducted fuzzy and semantic searches in wiki documentation, analyzed company rules, and evaluated permissions. The user Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) in Corporate Leadership department has permission to read employee and project participation data for this task, as confirmed by company rules allowing executive access and no restrictions found in policy documentation.

{
  "permission_granted": true,
  "reason": "User Viola Messina (Bhwa_001) is in Corporate Leadership department, which has executive-level access according to company rules. The task requires reading non-sensitive employee data (name, department, location) and project team membership data to count project participation. Company rules allow all employees to read basic employee fields via chatbot, and executives have broader access to project and client information. No access restrictions were found in policy documentation that would deny this read access."
}
