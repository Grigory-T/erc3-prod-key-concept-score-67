Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Viola Messina, id Bhwa_001) and retrieve her department, location, and system roles using a who_am_i() style lookup in the EmployeeRegistry.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or session service (for example, who_am_i() in the EmployeeRegistry or authentication layer) to obtain the full bound identity of the current user, including employee_id, department, location, and system_roles. This step does not require any fuzzy or semantic search because the current user context is already bound. Use the returned information as the basis for subsequent permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","department","location","system_roles"]}
