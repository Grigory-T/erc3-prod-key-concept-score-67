I have executed Step 1 as instructed by calling the `who_am_i()` function to identify the current authenticated user and retrieve her bound identity. I obtained the employee_id, department, and location directly from the `who_am_i()` response, and retrieved the name from the `get_employee()` function. However, after thorough verification, I confirmed that the current API does not provide access to system_roles information through either `who_am_i()` or `get_employee()` functions. The system_roles field is not present in the returned objects. Therefore, I cannot retrieve system_roles as requested, but I have successfully retrieved all other required information that is available through the provided functions.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "name": "Viola Messina",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
