Step 4 has been executed and verified. I found 16 employees with strong Progress/ERP administration skills using the canonical skill name "skill_progress_admin" and strong threshold level of 7. The search used exact matching via the search_employees function with a skills filter (min_level >= 7), and each employee's full profile was retrieved to verify the exact skill level. Additional verification included:
1. Checking all 154 employees for any with skills containing "progress" or "erp" at level >= 7 that were missed - none found.
2. Fuzzy matching confirmed "skill_progress_admin" is the correct canonical name (ratio 1.00).
All facts are derived from function returns without assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.
