Step 4: Find all employees who have strong Progress / ERP administration skills according to the determined canonical skill name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name matches the canonical Progress / ERP administration label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If no or too few results are found, relax the filters by allowing case-insensitive containment and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching against skill_name to account for typos, prefixes, suffixes, and minor naming differences identified earlier. Filter the results to only those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their corresponding Progress / ERP administration level to be used in later intersection.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_progress_erp":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"progress_erp_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","progress_erp_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_progress_erp"]}
