DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:43:56
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was successful and matched the expected result in the plan: the authenticated HR user has the necessary permission to read non-sensitive employee skills and wills data via chatbot. There are no unexpected results, errors, or policy conflicts up to this point. The workflow, as described in the original plan, is fully actionable and step 2 is clearly defined and ready for execution.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:49:34
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced valid, expected results. Step 2 successfully identified the canonical internal skill and will labels, with no discrepancies or missing information. There are no unexpected results or missing functions, and the context supports progressing exactly according to the original plan. Proceeding to Step 3 (determining numeric level threshold for 'strong') is correct and required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:54:07
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced clear, expected results strictly according to the original plan, with canonical skill and will labels identified and a strong skill/will threshold established. No discrepancies or roadblocks have occurred, and no evidence from the results implies that replanning or aborting is necessary. The original plan's logic and steps remain fully applicable, and the remaining steps can theoretically and practically be completed as planned. Therefore, the next correct action is to continue to Step 4.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:01:50
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan consists of six steps; so far, steps 1 through 4 have been completed exactly as specified, with results aligning with expected outputs. There were no authorization or information issues, and the relevant employees with strong Progress/ERP skills were correctly returned. The next step (Step 5) is to find employees with strong Willingness to travel using the verified canonical label and threshold, which can proceed exactly as written. There have been no surprises or inconsistencies; all prior steps returned correct and relevant results, and there is nothing unexpected requiring replanning. Therefore, the plan should proceed with Step 5 as designed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:08:33
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan has progressed successfully through all prior steps exactly as specified. Step 6 (Intersection and profile retrieval) is the only remaining part and can be completed with the available and correctly structured results from steps 4 and 5. There are no inconsistencies or missing information, and all necessary permissions and policy checks have been passed. No unexpected outcomes have occurred. Therefore, the task should continue to the final planned step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:12:16
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been executed fully and accurately. Each step produced the expected and correct result, following company rules and strict task requirements. No replanning or further actions are necessary. The intersection was found and the final list of employees matching both criteria is complete. There are no remaining steps. The task is fully COMPLETE.
