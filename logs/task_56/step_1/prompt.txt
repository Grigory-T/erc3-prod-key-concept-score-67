Step 1: Determine current user identity and verify permissions to read non-sensitive employee skills and wills data needed to answer who combines strong Progress / ERP administration skills and strong Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Invoke a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and authorization lookup to retrieve the current authenticated employee context for user id 'QR23_133', including department, location, and system_roles. Confirm that the user is an internal, authenticated employee (is_public == false) and that, under company rules, this user is allowed to perform read-only queries on EmployeeProfile data limited to non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department, skills, wills) without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. If permissions are insufficient to perform SearchBySkill-type queries, mark the task as security denied for later abort; otherwise proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills"]}
