I have executed the step instruction by calling who_am_i() to determine the current user identity and verified permissions based on company rules. The user QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) is an authenticated HR employee at HQ – Italy. According to company rules, all authenticated employees can access non-sensitive employee profile fields via chatbot, including skills and wills data. The user has sufficient permissions to perform SearchBySkill-type queries without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.
