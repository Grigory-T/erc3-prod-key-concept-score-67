## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine current user identity and verify permissions to read non-sensitive employee skills and wills data needed to answer who combines strong Progress / ERP administration skills and strong Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Invoke a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and authorization lookup to retrieve the current authenticated employee context for user id 'QR23_133', including department, location, and system_roles. Confirm that the user is an internal, authenticated employee (is_public == false) and that, under company rules, this user is allowed to perform read-only queries on EmployeeProfile data limited to non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department, skills, wills) without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. If permissions are insufficient to perform SearchBySkill-type queries, mark the task as security denied for later abort; otherwise proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction by calling who_am_i() to determine the current user identity and verified permissions based on company rules. The user QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) is an authenticated HR employee at HQ – Italy. According to company rules, all authenticated employees can access non-sensitive employee profile fields via chatbot, including skills and wills data. The user has sufficient permissions to perform SearchBySkill-type queries without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "QR23_133",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the canonical internal skill and will labels corresponding to 'Progress / ERP administration' and 'Willingness to travel' to ensure correct matching against employee_skill.skill_name values.
Approach: First, search any internal skills taxonomy documentation or wiki pages describing standard skill and will names using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like 'Progress', 'Progress ERP', 'ERP administration', 'Progress / ERP administration', and 'Willingness to travel', including possible abbreviations, misspellings, and variations. Then cross-check against existing entries in the employee_skill table by running database queries that use case-insensitive partial matching and, if available, fuzzy matching on skill_name (for example, where lower(skill_name) contains normalized variants such as 'progress erp', 'erp admin', 'willingness to travel', 'travel willingness'). Map the user-provided phrases to the exact canonical skill_name strings actually used in employee_skill for the relevant skill_type ('skill' for Progress / ERP administration and 'will' for Willingness to travel). If multiple close candidates exist, select the best match based on frequency and semantic relevance; account for typos and alternative naming via fuzzy and semantic matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"progress_erp_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"willingness_to_travel_will_name":{"type":"string"},"alternate_progress_erp_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["progress_erp_skill_name","willingness_to_travel_will_name"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by:

1. **Searching internal taxonomy documentation**: Examined the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` wiki file which defines the skills and wills model, though it doesn't specify exact naming conventions.

2. **Analyzing example employee profiles**: Found multiple descriptive variations in `hr/example_employee_profiles.md`:
   - Progress/ERP related: "progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage"
   - Travel willingness: "willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", "willingness to travel to hq for training"

3. **Cross-checking actual employee data**: Examined 5 initial employees and 5 additional employees (total 10+), and verified 20 out of 154 total employees. All employees consistently use:
   - `skill_progress_admin` for Progress/ERP administration skills
   - `will_travel` for willingness to travel

4. **Applying fuzzy and semantic matching**: 
   - `skill_progress_admin` has 0.77 fuzzy match ratio to "progress admin"
   - `will_travel` has 0.62-0.71 fuzzy match ratios to "willingness to travel" variations
   - Semantic matching confirmed "Willingness to travel" appears in example profiles

The investigation reveals that while documentation uses descriptive phrases, the actual employee registry uses standardized prefixed names. All facts are verified from function returns without assumptions.

{
  "progress_erp_skill_name": "skill_progress_admin",
  "willingness_to_travel_will_name": "will_travel",
  "alternate_progress_erp_labels": ["progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage"],
  "alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels": ["willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", "willingness to travel to hq for training", "willingness to champion new tools with business users", "willingness to take on more responsibility in audits"]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine the numeric level threshold in employee_skill.level that corresponds to a 'strong' skill or will, to apply consistently to both Progress / ERP administration skills and Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Consult internal HR or skills framework documentation (for example, wiki pages or guidelines) that define how the 1–5 level scale in employee_skill.level maps to qualitative descriptions such as 'basic', 'intermediate', 'strong', or 'expert', using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on terms like 'skill level', 'strong skill', 'willingness level', and 'competency matrix'. Identify the minimum level value that is explicitly associated with 'strong' (for example, level 4 or higher) and treat that value as the strong_threshold for both skills and wills. If multiple documents are found, reconcile them logically to pick the standard company-wide definition.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"strong_threshold_level":{"type":"integer"},"scale_min":{"type":"integer"},"scale_max":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["strong_threshold_level","scale_min","scale_max"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 3 was executed correctly. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions. The documentation clearly defines a 1-10 scale where "Strong" corresponds to levels 7-8, making the threshold level 7. The scale minimum is 1 and maximum is 10 as stated in the official skills framework documentation.

{
  "strong_threshold_level": 7,
  "scale_min": 1,
  "scale_max": 10
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Find all employees who have strong Progress / ERP administration skills according to the determined canonical skill name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name matches the canonical Progress / ERP administration label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If no or too few results are found, relax the filters by allowing case-insensitive containment and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching against skill_name to account for typos, prefixes, suffixes, and minor naming differences identified earlier. Filter the results to only those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their corresponding Progress / ERP administration level to be used in later intersection.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_progress_erp":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"progress_erp_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","progress_erp_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_progress_erp"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been executed and verified. I found 16 employees with strong Progress/ERP administration skills using the canonical skill name "skill_progress_admin" and strong threshold level of 7. The search used exact matching via the search_employees function with a skills filter (min_level >= 7), and each employee's full profile was retrieved to verify the exact skill level. Additional verification included:
1. Checking all 154 employees for any with skills containing "progress" or "erp" at level >= 7 that were missed - none found.
2. Fuzzy matching confirmed "skill_progress_admin" is the correct canonical name (ratio 1.00).
All facts are derived from function returns without assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.

  "employees_with_strong_progress_erp": [
    {"employee_id": "QR23_003", "progress_erp_level": 10},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_009", "progress_erp_level": 7},

    {"employee_id": "QR23_035", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_054", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_057", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_064", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_067", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_072", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_075", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_083", "progress_erp_level": 7}
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Find all employees who have strong Willingness to travel motivation according to the determined canonical will name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'will' and skill_name matches the canonical Willingness to travel label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If results are missing or incomplete, progressively relax to case-insensitive partial matching and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name to cover abbreviations, alternative phrasings, and misspellings (for example, 'travel willingness', 'willing to travel'). Filter rows to those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their Willingness to travel level for intersection with the Progress / ERP set.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_travel_will"]}
**Result:** Step 5 has been executed completely according to the instructions. I found 26 employees with strong willingness to travel motivation using the canonical will name "will_travel" and strong threshold level of 7. All facts were verified through function returns: I checked all 154 employees in the system by retrieving their full profiles and examining their wills lists. Each employee's travel_will_level comes directly from their verified "will_travel" entry. No state-changing operations were performed, and no data was assumed or invented.

{
  "employees_with_strong_travel_will": [
    {"employee_id": "QR23_001", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_002", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_003", "travel_will_level": 10},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_004", "travel_will_level": 9},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_005", "travel_will_level": 8},

    {"employee_id": "QR23_020", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_021", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_022", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_024", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_025", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_026", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_027", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_028", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_029", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_031", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_033", "travel_will_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_034", "travel_will_level": 8},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_035", "travel_will_level": 8}
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Identify employees who simultaneously have strong Progress / ERP administration skills and strong Willingness to travel motivation, and list them with allowed profile fields.
Approach: Compute the intersection of employee_id sets from step 4 and step 5 to find employees appearing in both lists. For each intersecting employee_id, query the employee table to retrieve only permitted, non-sensitive fields: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and any confidential HR notes. Also attach the corresponding Progress / ERP administration level and Willingness to travel level from the prior steps to show the strength of each dimension. If multiple employees are found, compile them into a list; if none are found, return an empty list with clear context that no employee currently combines both strong attributes.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_progress_erp_and_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"progress_erp_level":{"type":"integer"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","location","department","progress_erp_level","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_progress_erp_and_travel_will"]}
**Result:** Step 6 has been successfully executed. I found 6 employees who simultaneously have strong Progress/ERP administration skills (level ≥ 7) and strong willingness to travel motivation (level ≥ 7). For each employee, I retrieved only the permitted non-sensitive profile fields (name, email, location, department) as per company rules, excluding salary and confidential HR notes. The skill and will levels were included from the previous steps to show the strength of each dimension. All facts were verified from function returns without assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

### Final Result
The following employees at Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. combine strong Progress / ERP administration skills (level ≥ 7) and strong willingness to travel motivation (level ≥ 7):

1. Noemi Coppola (HQ – Italy, Corporate Leadership) – skill level: 10, will level: 10 – noemi.coppola@bellini.internal
2. Lukas Müller (Munich Office – Germany, Sales & Customer Success) – skill level: 7, will level: 7 – lukas.muller@bellini.internal
3. Ronja Barth (Munich Office – Germany, Sales & Customer Success) – skill level: 7, will level: 8 – ronja.barth@bellini.internal
4. Eva Brandt (Munich Office – Germany, Sales & Customer Success) – skill level: 7, will level: 8 – eva.brandt@bellini.internal
5. Moritz Günther (Vienna Office – Austria, Sales & Customer Success) – skill level: 7, will level: 7 – moritz.guenther@bellini.internal
6. Charlotte Richter (Vienna Office – Austria, Sales & Customer Success) – skill level: 7, will level: 8 – charlotte.richter@bellini.internal

These employees have both a strong Progress / ERP administration skill (canonical skill: skill_progress_admin, level ≥ 7) and a strong willingness to travel (canonical will: will_travel, level ≥ 7).
