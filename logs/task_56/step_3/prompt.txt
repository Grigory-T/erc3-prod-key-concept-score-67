Step 3: Determine the numeric level threshold in employee_skill.level that corresponds to a 'strong' skill or will, to apply consistently to both Progress / ERP administration skills and Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Consult internal HR or skills framework documentation (for example, wiki pages or guidelines) that define how the 1–5 level scale in employee_skill.level maps to qualitative descriptions such as 'basic', 'intermediate', 'strong', or 'expert', using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on terms like 'skill level', 'strong skill', 'willingness level', and 'competency matrix'. Identify the minimum level value that is explicitly associated with 'strong' (for example, level 4 or higher) and treat that value as the strong_threshold for both skills and wills. If multiple documents are found, reconcile them logically to pick the standard company-wide definition.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"strong_threshold_level":{"type":"integer"},"scale_min":{"type":"integer"},"scale_max":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["strong_threshold_level","scale_min","scale_max"]}
