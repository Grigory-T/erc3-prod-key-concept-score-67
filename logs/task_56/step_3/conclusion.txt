I have verified that Step 3 was executed correctly. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions. The documentation clearly defines a 1-10 scale where "Strong" corresponds to levels 7-8, making the threshold level 7. The scale minimum is 1 and maximum is 10 as stated in the official skills framework documentation.

{
  "strong_threshold_level": 7,
  "scale_min": 1,
  "scale_max": 10
}
