We are given a step: Determine the numeric level threshold that corresponds to a 'strong' skill or will, using internal documentation.
 Approach:
 1. We are in an HR context, so we likely have access to HR wiki pages.
 2. We need to search the wiki for documentation about skill levels, competency matrix, etc.
 3. We'll use fuzzy and semantic search to find relevant pages and then extract the level definition.

 Steps in code:
   a. First, list all wiki pages to see what's available.
   b. Then, search for keywords like "skill level", "strong", "competency", "matrix", "scale", etc., using fuzzy search.
   c. Load the most promising pages and look for definitions of levels 1-5 and what "strong" corresponds to.

 Important: The output expects an integer threshold for "strong", and the min and max of the scale (which we know is 1-5 from the context, but we should verify from documentation).

 However, note: The function `search_wiki_fuzzy` allows us to search for words in the wiki. We'll use that.

 Let's plan:
   - List wiki pages to get an idea.
   - Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with words: ["skill level", "strong", "competency", "matrix", "scale", "level 1", "level 5", "willingness level"]
   - From the results, we can load the most relevant files and parse the content for the level definitions.

 Since we are looking for a standard definition, we might find it in a file like "hr/competency_matrix.md" or "hr/skills_framework.md".

 We'll do:

  1. list_wiki() -> get all paths.
  2. search_wiki_fuzzy with the list of words.

 But note: The fuzzy search function `search_wiki_fuzzy` takes a list of words and returns matches for each word in the entire wiki.

 We'll try to search for multiple words and then look at the results.

 Let's write code accordingly.

We need to find documentation about skill level thresholds. Let's examine the HR-related wiki pages, especially 'hr/skills_and_wills_model.md' which was mentioned in previous steps, and also 'hr/people_and_roles.md'. We'll search for terms like "skill level", "strong", "competency", "matrix", etc. using fuzzy and semantic search.

We'll start by loading the most relevant pages and then perform searches.

[REASONING #11] 2025-12-09 21:52:16

We need to find the level threshold for "strong" skill/will. From the skills model content, we see a rating scale 1-10:
- 1–2: Very low – limited exposure or interest.
- 3–4: Basic – some experience or mild interest.
- 5–6: Solid – can perform reliably / clear and stable interest.
- 7–8: Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation.
- 9–10: Exceptional – go‑to person / very strong drive.

Thus, "strong" corresponds to levels 7–8. The minimum level for "strong" is 7. However, the expected output asks for a single integer threshold. We should interpret "strong" as level 7 or higher. So strong_threshold_level = 7.

Also, scale_min = 1, scale_max = 10.

But note: the documentation says "The maximum skill level configured in our systems is 10." So scale_max is 10.

Let's also verify if there are any other documents that might define differently. We can search the wiki for terms like "strong" to see if there is any other reference.

We'll do a fuzzy search on the wiki for the word "strong".

[REASONING #12] 2025-12-09 21:52:45
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to determine the numeric level threshold for "strong" from the documentation.
 From the skills_and_wills_model.md, we have:
   - 1–2: Very low
   - 3–4: Basic
   - 5–6: Solid
   - 7–8: Strong
   - 9–10: Exceptional

 So, the "strong" threshold is level 7 and above. However, note that the scale is 1-10.

 The expected output requires:
   - strong_threshold_level: the minimum level that is considered strong (7)
   - scale_min: minimum of the scale (1)
   - scale_max: maximum of the scale (10)

 But note: the documentation says "The maximum skill level configured in our systems is 10."

 However, we must be cautious: the step asks for the threshold for "strong" and the scale.
 We have found explicit documentation. Let's verify by reading more of the skills_and_wills_model.md to be sure.

 We already have the relevant lines. Let's extract them again and confirm.

 We'll do a fuzzy search on the wiki for the exact phrase "7–8:" to see if there are any other interpretations.

[REASONING #13] 2025-12-09 21:53:12
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found the rating scale definition in the skills_and_wills_model.md wiki page.
 The scale is 1-10, and the description for "Strong" is for levels 7-8.
 We need to determine the numeric level threshold for "strong". The documentation says:
   "7–8: Strong – recognised expertise / strong motivation."

 Since the task asks for a minimum level value that is explicitly associated with 'strong', we should set the threshold at 7.

 Additionally, the scale minimum is 1 and maximum is 10.

 Let's double-check if there are any other documents that might define a different threshold.
 We have searched for "threshold", "strong", "expert", "advanced" and found no contradicting information.

 The example employee profiles show levels up to 60, but that seems to be a mistake or a different context (perhaps years of experience?).
 However, the official rating scale in the skills and wills model is clearly 1-10.

 Therefore, we can conclude:
   strong_threshold_level = 7
   scale_min = 1
   scale_max = 10

 We should also note that the documentation says the maximum skill level configured in our systems is 10.

 Let's output the required information.

[REASONING #14] 2025-12-09 21:53:36
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a clear definition from the documentation. The rating scale is 1-10, and "Strong" is defined as levels 7-8.
 Therefore, the strong threshold level is 7 (the minimum of the "Strong" range). The scale minimum is 1 and maximum is 10.

 Let me also note that the documentation says: "The maximum skill level configured in our systems is 10."

 However, note that the example employee profiles had some level mentions up to 60. That might be a mistake or a different context.
 But the official scale in the skills_and_wills_model.md is 1-10, and we should stick to that.

 So the output should be:
   strong_threshold_level: 7
   scale_min: 1
   scale_max: 10

 I'll format the JSON accordingly.

We are given a step 3 to determine the numeric level threshold for "strong" skill or will.
 We have already executed the step and provided a conclusion. However, we are asked to verify.

 Let's recall what we did:

 1. We listed the wiki pages and found the HR documentation.
 2. We loaded the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` and found the rating scale.
 3. The rating scale says:
      - 1-2: Very low
      - 3-4: Basic
      - 5-6: Solid
      - 7-8: Strong
      - 9-10: Exceptional
 4. We also noted that the maximum level is 10.

 Therefore, the threshold for "strong" is 7 (the lower bound of the "Strong" range).

 However, note that the step description mentions a "1–5 level scale", but our documentation says 1-10.
 We must rely on the actual documentation we found, not the step description's example.

 Let's double-check by looking for any other references to a 1-5 scale.

 We can do a fuzzy search for "1-5" or "1–5" in the wiki.
