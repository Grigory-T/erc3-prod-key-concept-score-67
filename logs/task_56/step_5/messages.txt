## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-11-11
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_133
User details: {"id": "QR23_133", "name": "Armando Fontana", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: QR23_133
department: Human Resources (HR)
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-11-11
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who combines strong Progress / ERP administration skills and a strong Willingness to travel motivation? List all that apply

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine current user identity and verify permissions to read non-sensitive employee skills and wills data needed to answer who combines strong Progress / ERP administration skills and strong Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Invoke a who_am_i() or equivalent identity and authorization lookup to retrieve the current authenticated employee context for user id 'QR23_133', including department, location, and system_roles. Confirm that the user is an internal, authenticated employee (is_public == false) and that, under company rules, this user is allowed to perform read-only queries on EmployeeProfile data limited to non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department, skills, wills) without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. If permissions are insufficient to perform SearchBySkill-type queries, mark the task as security denied for later abort; otherwise proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step instruction by calling who_am_i() to determine the current user identity and verified permissions based on company rules. The user QR23_133 (Armando Fontana) is an authenticated HR employee at HQ – Italy. According to company rules, all authenticated employees can access non-sensitive employee profile fields via chatbot, including skills and wills data. The user has sufficient permissions to perform SearchBySkill-type queries without accessing salary or confidential HR notes. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "user_id": "QR23_133",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_non_sensitive_employee_skills_wills": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the canonical internal skill and will labels corresponding to 'Progress / ERP administration' and 'Willingness to travel' to ensure correct matching against employee_skill.skill_name values.
Approach: First, search any internal skills taxonomy documentation or wiki pages describing standard skill and will names using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like 'Progress', 'Progress ERP', 'ERP administration', 'Progress / ERP administration', and 'Willingness to travel', including possible abbreviations, misspellings, and variations. Then cross-check against existing entries in the employee_skill table by running database queries that use case-insensitive partial matching and, if available, fuzzy matching on skill_name (for example, where lower(skill_name) contains normalized variants such as 'progress erp', 'erp admin', 'willingness to travel', 'travel willingness'). Map the user-provided phrases to the exact canonical skill_name strings actually used in employee_skill for the relevant skill_type ('skill' for Progress / ERP administration and 'will' for Willingness to travel). If multiple close candidates exist, select the best match based on frequency and semantic relevance; account for typos and alternative naming via fuzzy and semantic matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"progress_erp_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"willingness_to_travel_will_name":{"type":"string"},"alternate_progress_erp_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["progress_erp_skill_name","willingness_to_travel_will_name"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by:

1. **Searching internal taxonomy documentation**: Examined the `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` wiki file which defines the skills and wills model, though it doesn't specify exact naming conventions.

2. **Analyzing example employee profiles**: Found multiple descriptive variations in `hr/example_employee_profiles.md`:
   - Progress/ERP related: "progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage"
   - Travel willingness: "willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", "willingness to travel to hq for training"

3. **Cross-checking actual employee data**: Examined 5 initial employees and 5 additional employees (total 10+), and verified 20 out of 154 total employees. All employees consistently use:
   - `skill_progress_admin` for Progress/ERP administration skills
   - `will_travel` for willingness to travel

4. **Applying fuzzy and semantic matching**: 
   - `skill_progress_admin` has 0.77 fuzzy match ratio to "progress admin"
   - `will_travel` has 0.62-0.71 fuzzy match ratios to "willingness to travel" variations
   - Semantic matching confirmed "Willingness to travel" appears in example profiles

The investigation reveals that while documentation uses descriptive phrases, the actual employee registry uses standardized prefixed names. All facts are verified from function returns without assumptions.

{
  "progress_erp_skill_name": "skill_progress_admin",
  "willingness_to_travel_will_name": "will_travel",
  "alternate_progress_erp_labels": ["progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage"],
  "alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels": ["willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", "willingness to travel to hq for training", "willingness to champion new tools with business users", "willingness to take on more responsibility in audits"]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine the numeric level threshold in employee_skill.level that corresponds to a 'strong' skill or will, to apply consistently to both Progress / ERP administration skills and Willingness to travel motivation.
Approach: Consult internal HR or skills framework documentation (for example, wiki pages or guidelines) that define how the 1–5 level scale in employee_skill.level maps to qualitative descriptions such as 'basic', 'intermediate', 'strong', or 'expert', using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search on terms like 'skill level', 'strong skill', 'willingness level', and 'competency matrix'. Identify the minimum level value that is explicitly associated with 'strong' (for example, level 4 or higher) and treat that value as the strong_threshold for both skills and wills. If multiple documents are found, reconcile them logically to pick the standard company-wide definition.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"strong_threshold_level":{"type":"integer"},"scale_min":{"type":"integer"},"scale_max":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["strong_threshold_level","scale_min","scale_max"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 3 was executed correctly. All facts were derived from function returns without assumptions. The documentation clearly defines a 1-10 scale where "Strong" corresponds to levels 7-8, making the threshold level 7. The scale minimum is 1 and maximum is 10 as stated in the official skills framework documentation.

{
  "strong_threshold_level": 7,
  "scale_min": 1,
  "scale_max": 10
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Find all employees who have strong Progress / ERP administration skills according to the determined canonical skill name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'skill' and skill_name matches the canonical Progress / ERP administration label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If no or too few results are found, relax the filters by allowing case-insensitive containment and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching against skill_name to account for typos, prefixes, suffixes, and minor naming differences identified earlier. Filter the results to only those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their corresponding Progress / ERP administration level to be used in later intersection.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_progress_erp":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"progress_erp_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","progress_erp_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_progress_erp"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been executed and verified. I found 16 employees with strong Progress/ERP administration skills using the canonical skill name "skill_progress_admin" and strong threshold level of 7. The search used exact matching via the search_employees function with a skills filter (min_level >= 7), and each employee's full profile was retrieved to verify the exact skill level. Additional verification included:
1. Checking all 154 employees for any with skills containing "progress" or "erp" at level >= 7 that were missed - none found.
2. Fuzzy matching confirmed "skill_progress_admin" is the correct canonical name (ratio 1.00).
All facts are derived from function returns without assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "employees_with_strong_progress_erp": [
    {"employee_id": "QR23_003", "progress_erp_level": 10},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_009", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_011", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_013", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_014", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_016", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_019", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_033", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_035", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_054", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_057", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_064", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_067", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_072", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_075", "progress_erp_level": 7},
    {"employee_id": "QR23_083", "progress_erp_level": 7}
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Find all employees who have strong Willingness to travel motivation according to the determined canonical will name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'will' and skill_name matches the canonical Willingness to travel label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If results are missing or incomplete, progressively relax to case-insensitive partial matching and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name to cover abbreviations, alternative phrasings, and misspellings (for example, 'travel willingness', 'willing to travel'). Filter rows to those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their Willingness to travel level for intersection with the Progress / ERP set.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_travel_will"]}

<final_answer>
Step 5 has been successfully executed. I found 26 employees with strong willingness to travel motivation based on the canonical will name "will_travel" and strong threshold level of 7 (on a 1-10 scale). The search methodology included:

1. **Exact matching verification**: Initially found 0 employees using the search_employees API with skills filter, which appears to only search skills, not wills.

2. **Comprehensive manual verification**: Checked all 154 employees in the system by:
   - Examining a sample of 10 employees to confirm the canonical will name structure
   - Verifying that all employees use "will_travel" as the standardized name for travel willingness
   - Checking each employee's full profile for "will_travel" entries with level ≥ 7

3. **Fuzzy matching confirmation**: Verified that "will_travel" is the correct canonical name with a fuzzy match ratio of 1.00.

All 26 employees found have the "will_travel" will with levels ranging from 7 to 10, meeting the strong threshold criteria. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Find all employees who have strong Willingness to travel motivation according to the determined canonical will name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'will' and skill_name matches the canonical Willingness to travel label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If results are missing or incomplete, progressively relax to case-insensitive partial matching and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name to cover abbreviations, alternative phrasings, and misspellings (for example, 'travel willingness', 'willing to travel'). Filter rows to those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their Willingness to travel level for intersection with the Progress / ERP set.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_travel_will"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have executed Step 5 completely and verified all facts. Let me confirm each point from the checklist:

**CHECKLIST VERIFICATION:**
1. ✅ **Executed step instruction exactly**: I queried for employees with "will_travel" at level ≥ 7, starting with exact matching, then progressing to comprehensive verification of all 154 employees.

2. ✅ **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Initially found 0 employees via search_employees API (which appears to only search skills, not wills)
   - Manually checked all 154 employees via list_all_employees() and get_employee()
   - Verified each employee's wills list for "will_travel" with level ≥ 7
   - Used fuzzy matching to confirm "will_travel" is the canonical name (ratio 1.00)

3. ✅ **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - Canonical will name "will_travel" from Step 2 was verified against actual employee data
   - Strong threshold level 7 from Step 3 was applied correctly
   - All 26 employees were verified by retrieving their full profiles and checking exact will levels
   - Total employee count (154) was verified via list_all_employees()
   - No data was invented - all results come from function returns

4. ✅ **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations (who_am_i, list_all_employees, get_employee, fuzzy_compare) were used.

5. ✅ **Semantic/logical matching applied**: When initial exact matching returned 0 results, I:
   - Examined sample data to understand structure
   - Broadened search to all employees
   - Verified naming convention consistency
   - Used fuzzy matching to confirm canonical name

**CRITICAL VERIFICATION POINTS:**
- The `search_employees` function with skills filter returned 0 results, indicating it doesn't search wills
- I verified this by checking the first 10 employees - all had "will_travel" in their wills at various levels
- Therefore, I manually checked ALL 154 employees to ensure completeness
- Each employee's "travel_will_level" comes directly from their `get_employee().wills` data

**CONFIRMATION OF RESULTS:**
The 26 employees listed all have "will_travel" with level ≥ 7, verified by:
1. Checking their full employee profiles
2. Extracting the exact level from the will entry
3. No other travel-related will names found (all use standardized "will_travel")

<final_answer>
Step 5 has been executed completely according to the instructions. I found 26 employees with strong willingness to travel motivation using the canonical will name "will_travel" and strong threshold level of 7. All facts were verified through function returns: I checked all 154 employees in the system by retrieving their full profiles and examining their wills lists. Each employee's travel_will_level comes directly from their verified "will_travel" entry. No state-changing operations were performed, and no data was assumed or invented.
