Step 5: Find all employees who have strong Willingness to travel motivation according to the determined canonical will name and strong level threshold.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table for rows where skill_type = 'will' and skill_name matches the canonical Willingness to travel label from step 2, using case-insensitive exact matching first. If results are missing or incomplete, progressively relax to case-insensitive partial matching and then **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name to cover abbreviations, alternative phrasings, and misspellings (for example, 'travel willingness', 'willing to travel'). Filter rows to those with level >= strong_threshold_level from step 3. Collect the distinct employee_id values and their Willingness to travel level for intersection with the Progress / ERP set.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_travel_will"]}
