We are at Step 2 of the task. The goal is to identify the canonical internal skill and will labels for 'Progress / ERP administration' and 'Willingness to travel'.

Approach:
1. We need to search for existing skills and wills in the employee data. Since we don't have a direct function to list all skill names, we can fetch a few employees and examine their skills and wills to get the canonical names.
2. Alternatively, we can search the wiki for any documentation on skills taxonomy.
3. We can also use fuzzy matching on the skill/will names we gather.

However, note that the available functions do not include a direct way to list all distinct skill names. We can:
- Use `list_all_employees()` to get all employees, then for each employee get their full profile (but this would be many calls and might be heavy).
- Alternatively, we can use `search_employees` with a skill filter to see which skill names are used, but we don't know the exact names.

Better approach:
Step 2.1: Search the wiki for any documentation on skills and wills.
Step 2.2: If wiki doesn't help, we can fetch a subset of employees and collect the skill and will names that are present.

But note: the step says to use fuzzy and semantic search. We can use `search_wiki_fuzzy` and `fuzzy_find_in_text` on wiki content.

Let's break down:

We need to find:
- The canonical skill name for 'Progress / ERP administration'
- The canonical will name for 'Willingness to travel'

We'll try to search the wiki first for these terms.

We have the function `search_wiki_fuzzy(words, top_n, context_chars)`. We can use it with the words: ['Progress', 'ERP', 'administration', 'Willingness', 'travel'].

But note: the step says to search for terms like 'Progress', 'Progress ERP', 'ERP administration', etc.

Let's start by searching the wiki for these terms.

We'll also look at the employee data. Since we are allowed to read non-sensitive employee data, we can fetch a few employees and see what skill and will names they have.

We can use `list_employees` to get a list of employees, then for each, call `get_employee` to get their skills and wills. But we don't want to do too many calls. We can do a few and see if we can find the terms.

Alternatively, we can use `search_employees` with a skill filter, but we don't know the exact skill name.

Let's first try the wiki.

We'll write code to:
1. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the words related to Progress/ERP and travel willingness.
2. Also, we can list a few employees and examine their skills and wills.

We must be cautious: we don't want to make too many calls and hit limits. We'll start with wiki, then if needed, sample a few employees.

Let's execute.

[REASONING #5] 2025-12-09 21:46:50

We have an error in the code: we tried to access `w.will` but SkillLevel objects have `level` attribute, not `will`.
 Let's fix that and continue. Also, note that the will objects are also SkillLevel type, so they have `name` and `level`.
 We'll adjust the code accordingly.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #6] 2025-12-09 21:47:21
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have completed Step 2 and identified the canonical labels for the skill and will.

From the analysis:
1. The canonical skill name for "Progress / ERP administration" is **`skill_progress_admin`** (found in employee data with high frequency and the best fuzzy match ratio of 0.77 for "progress admin").
2. The canonical will name for "Willingness to travel" is **`will_travel`** (found in employee data with high frequency and the best fuzzy match ratio of 0.71 for "travel" and 0.62 for "willingness to travel").

We also found alternate labels in the example employee profiles (from the wiki) but note that these are not in the current employee data we sampled. However, the task asks for alternate labels we found, so we should include them.

From the example employee profiles, we found:
- Alternate Progress/ERP labels: ['progress system usage', 'progress openedge administration', 'crm and erp usage']
- Alternate travel willingness labels: ['willingness to travel', 'willingness to relocate abroad', 'willingness to travel to hq for training', 'willingness to champion new tools with business users', 'willingness to take on more responsibility in audits']

But note: the example profiles are from the wiki and not necessarily in the current employee data. However, the step says to include alternate labels we found via our search.

Let's structure the output accordingly.

Expected output format:
{
  "progress_erp_skill_name": "skill_progress_admin",
  "willingness_to_travel_will_name": "will_travel",
  "alternate_progress_erp_labels": ["progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage"],
  "alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels": ["willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", ...]
}

We note that the example profiles are in the wiki and are considered part of the internal documentation, so they are valid alternate labels.

However, note that in the employee data we only found one variant for each. So we'll report the ones from the example profiles as alternate labels.

Let's create the final answer.

The user asks to verify the step execution and checklist. I need to review what I did and ensure I followed the step instruction correctly, used only verified data, and didn't miss any actions.

Step 2 goal: Identify canonical internal skill and will labels for 'Progress / ERP administration' and 'Willingness to travel'.

Approach as per step description: Search internal taxonomy documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC/LOGICAL search, cross-check against employee_skill table using case-insensitive partial matching and fuzzy matching, map to exact canonical strings.

What I did:

1. I examined wiki files, particularly `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md`.
2. From example profiles, I extracted skill/will names using regex: found progress-related skills like "progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage". Found travel-related wills like "willingness to travel", etc.
3. I examined actual employee data by listing employees and getting their full profiles. I found that all sampled employees have `skill_progress_admin` as a skill and `will_travel` as a will. That's 5 employees.
4. I expanded to more employees (second batch) and found the same unique skill/will sets.
5. I performed fuzzy matching: For progress/ERP, the best match was `skill_progress_admin` with ratio 0.77 for target "progress admin". For travel, best match was `will_travel` with ratio 0.71 for target "travel".
6. I determined canonical names as `skill_progress_admin` and `will_travel`.
7. I listed alternate labels from the example profiles.

Checklist:

- Did I execute the step instruction? Yes, I searched wiki, did fuzzy search, cross-checked employee data, used fuzzy matching.
- Skipped or assumed? I think I did all requested. However, the step says "search any internal skills taxonomy documentation or wiki pages describing standard skill and will names using a FUZZY and SEMANTIC/LOGICAL search". I did fuzzy search on wiki with `search_wiki_fuzzy` for terms like 'progress', 'erp', etc. That gave matches in various files. I also loaded the specific taxonomy file and example profiles. That seems adequate.
- All facts verified? The skill names from employee data are directly from `get_employee` calls. The alternate labels from example profiles are from regex parsing of wiki content. The fuzzy matching results are from `fuzzy_compare`. All printed.

Potential issues:

- The step expects "canonical internal skill and will labels". The employee data shows prefixed names (`skill_progress_admin`, `will_travel`). The example profiles show more descriptive names. Which is canonical? The step says "map the user-provided phrases to the exact canonical skill_name strings actually used in employee_skill". That suggests the actual strings in the employee_skill table are canonical. So `skill_progress_admin` and `will_travel` are correct.

- Did I consider that there might be other variants? I only sampled 10 employees (first 5 + next 5). I could check more employees to ensure no other variants exist. However, the unique skill/will sets remained the same after second batch, suggesting consistency. But perhaps there are employees with different naming? The step says "If multiple close candidates exist, select the best match based on frequency and semantic relevance." I found only one variant in employee data: `skill_progress_admin` appears in all employees; no other progress/ERP skill names. Similarly for `will_travel`. So frequency is high.

- Alternate labels: I included those from example profiles. But are there other alternate labels from employee data? I didn't find any. So my alternate arrays are from example profiles only. That seems fine.

- Semantic/logical matching: I considered abbreviations like "ERP" and "admin". The employee skill name is `skill_progress_admin` which includes "progress" and "admin" but not "ERP". However, the fuzzy matching shows "progress admin" matches well. The step mentions "Progress / ERP administration". Could be that "progress admin" is the canonical for Progress administration (maybe ERP is separate). But the user phrase is "Progress / ERP administration". In example profiles, there is "progress openedge administration" and "crm and erp usage". Possibly "ERP administration" might be a separate skill. However, in employee data, we only see `skill_progress_admin`. Maybe ERP administration is not a separate skill but part of progress admin. I think it's acceptable.

- Should I have searched for "ERP" specifically in employee skills? I did: I checked if 'erp' in skill name lower. None of the employee skills contain 'erp'. So the closest is `skill_progress_admin`.

- For travel: employee data has `will_travel`. Example profiles have "willingness to travel". That's a close semantic match.

Thus, I believe the results are correct.

Now, the user asks: "If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks."

So I will output the same as before, but ensure JSON contains only verified data. The alternate labels were extracted from example profiles via regex; I printed them. They are verified from wiki content.

Thus, final answer and JSON.

But wait: The verification step says "If something was missed, execute the missing action now." I should double-check if there are any other employee skill/will naming variations by searching all employees? Possibly, but listing all employees and checking each might be heavy. However, I can use `search_employees` with skills filter? The function `search_employees` accepts `skills` parameter as list of dicts with name and min_level. But to find all skill names, I need to examine many employees. I already examined 10, and unique sets were same. Could there be employees with different skill names? Possibly, but for the purpose of canonical labels, the most frequent one is likely correct.

Alternatively, I could search wiki more thoroughly for a taxonomy list. In the skills_and_wills_model.md, there might be a list of standard names. I didn't see a comprehensive list. I could search for "standard skills" or "list of skills". Let me quickly check the wiki content again for any enumerated list.

I'll write a small additional check to search the wiki for any bulleted lists of skills.

But note: The user says "If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks."

I am reasonably sure. However, to be thorough, let me do one more quick check: search wiki for lines containing "skill_" or "will_" to see if there is any documentation of the prefix convention.

I'll execute a small code snippet.

```python
# Additional verification: Search wiki for skill/will naming conventions
print("=== Additional verification: Wiki search for skill/will naming ===")
all_wiki = list_wiki()
for file in all_wiki:
    if 'hr' in file:
        content = load_wiki(file)
        if content:
            lines = content.split('\n')
            for i, line in enumerate(lines):
                if 'skill_' in line or 'will_' in line:
                    print(f"{file}:{i+1}: {line[:100]}")
```

Then, also check if there are any other skill names containing "erp" or "progress" beyond the sampled employees by searching all employees? That would be many calls, but I can use `list_all_employees()` to get all briefs, then sample a few more.

But given the user's instruction to not verify again if sure, I might skip. However, the verification step is asking to confirm. I think I should do these checks to be absolutely sure.

Let me run the additional code.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #8] 2025-12-09 21:49:31
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have verified that:
 - The employee registry uses prefixed names: "skill_progress_admin" and "will_travel"
 - In the example profiles, we see "Willingness to travel" as a will (without the "will_" prefix) and also mentions of "Progress system usage", "Progress OpenEdge administration", etc.
 - However, the actual data in the employee registry (from get_employee calls) shows only "skill_progress_admin" and "will_travel".

We must note that the example profiles are documentation and show more descriptive names, but the actual system uses the prefixed names.

For the expected output, we have:
 - progress_erp_skill_name: "skill_progress_admin"
 - willingness_to_travel_will_name: "will_travel"
 - alternate_progress_erp_labels: from the example profiles and any other variants we found (like "progress system usage", "progress openedge administration", "crm and erp usage")
 - alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels: from the example profiles (like "willingness to travel", "willingness to relocate abroad", etc.)

We should include the alternate labels we found in the example profiles and any other variations.

However, note that in the employee data we did not find any other variations for the skill and will names. The alternate labels are from the example profiles.

We have already printed and verified these.

Now, we are confident in our results.

Let's provide the final answer and JSON.
