Step 2: Identify the canonical internal skill and will labels corresponding to 'Progress / ERP administration' and 'Willingness to travel' to ensure correct matching against employee_skill.skill_name values.
Approach: First, search any internal skills taxonomy documentation or wiki pages describing standard skill and will names using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms like 'Progress', 'Progress ERP', 'ERP administration', 'Progress / ERP administration', and 'Willingness to travel', including possible abbreviations, misspellings, and variations. Then cross-check against existing entries in the employee_skill table by running database queries that use case-insensitive partial matching and, if available, fuzzy matching on skill_name (for example, where lower(skill_name) contains normalized variants such as 'progress erp', 'erp admin', 'willingness to travel', 'travel willingness'). Map the user-provided phrases to the exact canonical skill_name strings actually used in employee_skill for the relevant skill_type ('skill' for Progress / ERP administration and 'will' for Willingness to travel). If multiple close candidates exist, select the best match based on frequency and semantic relevance; account for typos and alternative naming via fuzzy and semantic matching.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"progress_erp_skill_name":{"type":"string"},"willingness_to_travel_will_name":{"type":"string"},"alternate_progress_erp_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"alternate_willingness_to_travel_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["progress_erp_skill_name","willingness_to_travel_will_name"]}
