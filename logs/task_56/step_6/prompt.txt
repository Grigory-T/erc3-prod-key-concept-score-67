Step 6: Identify employees who simultaneously have strong Progress / ERP administration skills and strong Willingness to travel motivation, and list them with allowed profile fields.
Approach: Compute the intersection of employee_id sets from step 4 and step 5 to find employees appearing in both lists. For each intersecting employee_id, query the employee table to retrieve only permitted, non-sensitive fields: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and any confidential HR notes. Also attach the corresponding Progress / ERP administration level and Willingness to travel level from the prior steps to show the strength of each dimension. If multiple employees are found, compile them into a list; if none are found, return an empty list with clear context that no employee currently combines both strong attributes.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employees_with_strong_progress_erp_and_travel_will":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"progress_erp_level":{"type":"integer"},"travel_will_level":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","location","department","progress_erp_level","travel_will_level"]}}},"required":["employees_with_strong_progress_erp_and_travel_will"]}
