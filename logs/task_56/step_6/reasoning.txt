We are at step 6. We have two lists from step 4 and step 5.

Step 4 output: 16 employees with strong Progress/ERP administration skills (skill_progress_admin, level >=7)
Step 5 output: 26 employees with strong willingness to travel (will_travel, level >=7)

We need to find the intersection of these two sets (employee_id) and then for each employee in the intersection, retrieve the allowed non-sensitive fields (name, email, location, department) and also include the progress_erp_level and travel_will_level.

From step 4, we have:
[
  {"employee_id": "QR23_003", "progress_erp_level": 10},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_009", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_011", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_013", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_014", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_016", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_019", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_033", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_035", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_054", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_057", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_064", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_067", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_072", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_075", "progress_erp_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_083", "progress_erp_level": 7}
]

From step 5, we have:
[
  {"employee_id": "QR23_001", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_002", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_003", "travel_will_level": 10},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_004", "travel_will_level": 9},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_005", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_006", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_007", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_008", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_014", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_015", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_016", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_017", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_019", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_020", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_021", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_022", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_024", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_025", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_026", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_027", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_028", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_029", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_031", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_033", "travel_will_level": 7},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_034", "travel_will_level": 8},
  {"employee_id": "QR23_035", "travel_will_level": 8}
]

Intersection: Employees who appear in both lists:
  QR23_003 (in both)
  QR23_014 (in both)
  QR23_016 (in both)
  QR23_019 (in both)
  QR23_033 (in both)
  QR23_035 (in both)

Now for each of these employee_ids, we need to get the employee details (name, email, location, department) from the employee registry, but only the non-sensitive fields.

We have the progress_erp_level and travel_will_level from the previous steps.

We must use the `get_employee` function to retrieve the employee details. According to company rules, when accessed via chatbot, we are allowed to return only the fields: name, email, location, department, basic_role, and a context relevant subset of skills and wills. However, the expected output only requires name, email, location, department. We also have the levels from our previous steps.

We should verify that the current user (QR23_133, HR) is allowed to read these non-sensitive fields. From step 1, we confirmed that the user can read non-sensitive employee skills and wills data, so this is allowed.

Let's proceed by writing Python code to compute the intersection and then retrieve the required information for each intersecting employee.

We'll write code in the next cell.

We have successfully found the intersection of employees with both strong Progress/ERP skills and strong travel will.
 We have retrieved the allowed non-sensitive fields for each employee (name, email, location, department) along with the skill and will levels.
 Now, we need to format the output as specified in the expected output.
 The output should be a JSON object with a single property "employees_with_strong_progress_erp_and_travel_will" which is an array of objects.
 Each object must have the following fields: employee_id, name, email, location, department, progress_erp_level, travel_will_level.
 We have collected these in the `result` list.
 Let's create the final JSON output.

We need to verify that the step was executed correctly and all data is from function returns.

I have executed the step by:
1. Computing the intersection of employee IDs from Step 4 and Step 5.
2. For each intersecting employee ID, I called `get_employee(emp_id)` to retrieve the employee details.
3. From the employee details, I extracted only the allowed non-sensitive fields: name, email, location, department.
4. I also included the progress_erp_level and travel_will_level from the previous steps (from the dictionaries built from Steps 4 and 5).
5. All data was printed and verified.

The output shows that I found 6 employees. For each employee, I printed the details obtained from `get_employee` and the levels from the dictionaries.

I did not make any assumptions. All data came from function returns. I did not perform any state-changing operations.

Therefore, the JSON provided is correct and complete.

I will now repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
