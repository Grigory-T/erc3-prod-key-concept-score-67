I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's a verification of my approach:

1. **Selected appropriate customer records**: From Step 1 and Step 2 results, I selected the exact matches:
   - BalkanRail Components: `cust_balkan_rail_components` (exact match, score 1.0)
   - Adriatic Marine Services Provider: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` (exact match, score 1.0)

2. **Verified customer details**: Retrieved full customer objects using `get_customer()` to confirm names.

3. **Counted projects using exact customer_id matching**: For each customer ID, I used `search_projects()` with `customer_id` parameter and `include_archived=True` to count ALL projects regardless of status. Used pagination to ensure complete results.

4. **Performed fallback checks**: As instructed, I performed broader searches using query parameters to check for projects that might reference customer names in project names or descriptions, which confirmed the same results.

5. **All data verified from function returns**: All customer IDs, names, and project counts were obtained directly from function returns (`get_customer()`, `search_projects()`). No data was made up or assumed.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

Result: Both customers have exactly 1 project each.
