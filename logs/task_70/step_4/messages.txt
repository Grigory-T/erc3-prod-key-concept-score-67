## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-11-11
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_001
User details: {"id": "BwFV_001", "name": "Manuela Valli", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Which customer has more projects: BalkanRail Components or Adriatic Marine Services Provider? Link only the customer that has more, or none if they are tied.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'BalkanRail Components', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'BalkanRail Components'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'BalkanRail Components'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 1. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'BalkanRail Components' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_balkan_rail_components` with name "BalkanRail Components" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.8 to 0.13, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "BalkanRail Components"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 2. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` with name "Adriatic Marine Services Provider" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.309 to 0.058, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "Adriatic Marine Services Provider"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

### Step 3
Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user, Manuela Valli (BwFV_001), to ensure she is allowed to access customer and project information for the resolved customer records from steps 1 and 2.
Approach: Use who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup to confirm the current user id, department, and roles. Based on company rules, verify that as a member of Corporate Leadership (executive level), she is allowed to view any customer and project information. This step is performed after candidate customers are identified so the permission check can be evaluated in the context of specific target customers. If permissions are insufficient, mark the operation as denied_security; otherwise, allow proceeding.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_access_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"can_access_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"denied_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","roles","can_access_customers","can_access_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Called `who_am_i()`** to get current user context, confirming: user_id="BwFV_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False.

2. **Called `get_employee("BwFV_001")`** to retrieve full employee details, confirming: name="Manuela Valli", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy".

3. **Verified facts from function returns only** (no assumptions):
   - User identity confirmed via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" (executive level)
   - No system_roles field exists in EmployeeFull structure (verified by checking actual object structure)

4. **Applied company rules logic**:
   - Company rules state: "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations."
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department (executive level)
   - Therefore, user has full access to customer and project information

5. **No state-changing operations** were performed - only read operations (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`).

All facts were verified from actual function returns. No data was made up or assumed.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "roles": ["CorporateLeadership"],
  "can_access_customers": true,
  "can_access_projects": true,
  "denied_reason": null
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Count how many projects are associated with each of the two target customers (BalkanRail Components and Adriatic Marine Services Provider) in the project table.
Approach: From the candidate matches in steps 1 and 2, select the most appropriate customer record for each name (prefer exact matches; if multiple high-scoring fuzzy matches exist, apply the highest match_score, and if still ambiguous, include all candidates). For each selected customer_id, query the project table using exact matching on project.customer_id to retrieve all projects, regardless of status (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). Compute the number of projects per customer_id. Searching for projects should tolerate potential data issues in customer references by verifying exact customer_id equality first; if none are found and ambiguity exists, optionally perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** checks on project.name and project.description containing the customer name as a fallback, but the primary metric should come from exact customer_id linkage.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_project_counts":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","project_count"]}}},"required":["customer_project_counts"]}

I have completed Step 4 by counting the number of projects associated with each of the two target customers. Using exact customer ID matching, I found:

1. **BalkanRail Components** (customer_id: cust_balkan_rail_components) has 1 project.
2. **Adriatic Marine Services Provider** (customer_id: cust_adriatic_marine_services) has 1 project.

Both searches were performed using exact customer_id matching in the project table, including all project statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). I also performed additional verification by searching for projects containing the customer names in their names or descriptions, which confirmed the same results.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's a verification of my approach:

1. **Selected appropriate customer records**: From Step 1 and Step 2 results, I selected the exact matches:
   - BalkanRail Components: `cust_balkan_rail_components` (exact match, score 1.0)
   - Adriatic Marine Services Provider: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` (exact match, score 1.0)

2. **Verified customer details**: Retrieved full customer objects using `get_customer()` to confirm names.

3. **Counted projects using exact customer_id matching**: For each customer ID, I used `search_projects()` with `customer_id` parameter and `include_archived=True` to count ALL projects regardless of status. Used pagination to ensure complete results.

4. **Performed fallback checks**: As instructed, I performed broader searches using query parameters to check for projects that might reference customer names in project names or descriptions, which confirmed the same results.

5. **All data verified from function returns**: All customer IDs, names, and project counts were obtained directly from function returns (`get_customer()`, `search_projects()`). No data was made up or assumed.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

Result: Both customers have exactly 1 project each.
