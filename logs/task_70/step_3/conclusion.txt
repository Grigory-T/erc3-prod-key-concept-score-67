Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Called `who_am_i()`** to get current user context, confirming: user_id="BwFV_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False.

2. **Called `get_employee("BwFV_001")`** to retrieve full employee details, confirming: name="Manuela Valli", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy".

3. **Verified facts from function returns only** (no assumptions):
   - User identity confirmed via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" (executive level)
   - No system_roles field exists in EmployeeFull structure (verified by checking actual object structure)

4. **Applied company rules logic**:
   - Company rules state: "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations."
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department (executive level)
   - Therefore, user has full access to customer and project information

5. **No state-changing operations** were performed - only read operations (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`).

All facts were verified from actual function returns. No data was made up or assumed.
