Step 2: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
