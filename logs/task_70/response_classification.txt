## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'BalkanRail Components', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'BalkanRail Components'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'BalkanRail Components'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 1. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'BalkanRail Components' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_balkan_rail_components` with name "BalkanRail Components" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.8 to 0.13, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "BalkanRail Components"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 2. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` with name "Adriatic Marine Services Provider" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.309 to 0.058, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "Adriatic Marine Services Provider"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user, Manuela Valli (BwFV_001), to ensure she is allowed to access customer and project information for the resolved customer records from steps 1 and 2.
Approach: Use who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup to confirm the current user id, department, and roles. Based on company rules, verify that as a member of Corporate Leadership (executive level), she is allowed to view any customer and project information. This step is performed after candidate customers are identified so the permission check can be evaluated in the context of specific target customers. If permissions are insufficient, mark the operation as denied_security; otherwise, allow proceeding.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_access_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"can_access_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"denied_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","roles","can_access_customers","can_access_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Called `who_am_i()`** to get current user context, confirming: user_id="BwFV_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False.

2. **Called `get_employee("BwFV_001")`** to retrieve full employee details, confirming: name="Manuela Valli", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy".

3. **Verified facts from function returns only** (no assumptions):
   - User identity confirmed via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" (executive level)
   - No system_roles field exists in EmployeeFull structure (verified by checking actual object structure)

4. **Applied company rules logic**:
   - Company rules state: "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations."
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department (executive level)
   - Therefore, user has full access to customer and project information

5. **No state-changing operations** were performed - only read operations (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`).

All facts were verified from actual function returns. No data was made up or assumed.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "roles": ["CorporateLeadership"],
  "can_access_customers": true,
  "can_access_projects": true,
  "denied_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Count how many projects are associated with each of the two target customers (BalkanRail Components and Adriatic Marine Services Provider) in the project table.
Approach: From the candidate matches in steps 1 and 2, select the most appropriate customer record for each name (prefer exact matches; if multiple high-scoring fuzzy matches exist, apply the highest match_score, and if still ambiguous, include all candidates). For each selected customer_id, query the project table using exact matching on project.customer_id to retrieve all projects, regardless of status (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). Compute the number of projects per customer_id. Searching for projects should tolerate potential data issues in customer references by verifying exact customer_id equality first; if none are found and ambiguity exists, optionally perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** checks on project.name and project.description containing the customer name as a fallback, but the primary metric should come from exact customer_id linkage.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_project_counts":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","project_count"]}}},"required":["customer_project_counts"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's a verification of my approach:

1. **Selected appropriate customer records**: From Step 1 and Step 2 results, I selected the exact matches:
   - BalkanRail Components: `cust_balkan_rail_components` (exact match, score 1.0)
   - Adriatic Marine Services Provider: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` (exact match, score 1.0)

2. **Verified customer details**: Retrieved full customer objects using `get_customer()` to confirm names.

3. **Counted projects using exact customer_id matching**: For each customer ID, I used `search_projects()` with `customer_id` parameter and `include_archived=True` to count ALL projects regardless of status. Used pagination to ensure complete results.

4. **Performed fallback checks**: As instructed, I performed broader searches using query parameters to check for projects that might reference customer names in project names or descriptions, which confirmed the same results.

5. **All data verified from function returns**: All customer IDs, names, and project counts were obtained directly from function returns (`get_customer()`, `search_projects()`). No data was made up or assumed.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

Result: Both customers have exactly 1 project each.

{
  "customer_project_counts": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkan_rail_components",
      "customer_name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "project_count": 1
    },
    {

      "customer_name": "Adriatic Marine Services Provider",
      "project_count": 1
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
None should be linked, because BalkanRail Components and Adriatic Marine Services Provider each have exactly 1 project (it is a tie).

employee_id: BwFV_001, is_public: False , department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy

## Original Task
Which customer has more projects: BalkanRail Components or Adriatic Marine Services Provider? Link only the customer that has more, or none if they are tied.

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'BalkanRail Components', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'BalkanRail Components'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'BalkanRail Components'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 1. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'BalkanRail Components' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_balkan_rail_components` with name "BalkanRail Components" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.8 to 0.13, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "BalkanRail Components"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify customer records in the customer table corresponding to the name 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider', accounting for possible typos, misspellings, and partial naming variants.
Approach: Execute an initial exact match search on customer.name for 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. If no single clear match is found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over customer.name and customer.brief (case-normalized, whitespace-trimmed), including partial matching, substring search, and fuzzy string comparison to capture possible variants or misspellings. If needed, list all customers and select candidates whose names or briefs semantically relate to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider'. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; just return the candidate list with match scores.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"},"is_exact":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","match_score","is_exact"]}}},"required":["query","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 2. I executed a comprehensive search for customer records corresponding to 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider' using the following approach:

1. **Exact match search**: Found one exact match in customer.name: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` with name "Adriatic Marine Services Provider" (score: 1.0, is_exact: true).

2. **Fuzzy and semantic search**: Performed fuzzy string comparison on both customer names and briefs for all 21 customers using `fuzzy_compare()` function.

3. **Comprehensive analysis**: For each customer, I:
   - Retrieved full customer details to access both name and brief fields
   - Calculated fuzzy match scores for both name and brief
   - Checked for substring matches (target query appearing in name or brief)
   - Calculated semantic word overlap between target query and customer name/brief
   - Combined these factors to determine a final match score

4. **Results**: Found 21 total matches, including:
   - 1 exact match (score 1.0)
   - 20 additional matches with scores ranging from 0.309 to 0.058, representing customers with names or briefs that share similarities with "Adriatic Marine Services Provider"

All data was derived from function returns (`list_all_customers()`, `get_customer()`, `fuzzy_compare()`) with no assumptions or made-up data. No state-changing operations were performed during this search-only step.

  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user, Manuela Valli (BwFV_001), to ensure she is allowed to access customer and project information for the resolved customer records from steps 1 and 2.
Approach: Use who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup to confirm the current user id, department, and roles. Based on company rules, verify that as a member of Corporate Leadership (executive level), she is allowed to view any customer and project information. This step is performed after candidate customers are identified so the permission check can be evaluated in the context of specific target customers. If permissions are insufficient, mark the operation as denied_security; otherwise, allow proceeding.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_access_customers":{"type":"boolean"},"can_access_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"denied_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","roles","can_access_customers","can_access_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Called `who_am_i()`** to get current user context, confirming: user_id="BwFV_001", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy", is_public=False.

2. **Called `get_employee("BwFV_001")`** to retrieve full employee details, confirming: name="Manuela Valli", department="Corporate Leadership", location="HQ – Italy".

3. **Verified facts from function returns only** (no assumptions):
   - User identity confirmed via `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" (executive level)
   - No system_roles field exists in EmployeeFull structure (verified by checking actual object structure)

4. **Applied company rules logic**:
   - Company rules state: "Executives, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations."
   - User is in "Corporate Leadership" department (executive level)
   - Therefore, user has full access to customer and project information

5. **No state-changing operations** were performed - only read operations (`who_am_i()`, `get_employee()`).

All facts were verified from actual function returns. No data was made up or assumed.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "roles": ["CorporateLeadership"],
  "can_access_customers": true,
  "can_access_projects": true,
  "denied_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Count how many projects are associated with each of the two target customers (BalkanRail Components and Adriatic Marine Services Provider) in the project table.
Approach: From the candidate matches in steps 1 and 2, select the most appropriate customer record for each name (prefer exact matches; if multiple high-scoring fuzzy matches exist, apply the highest match_score, and if still ambiguous, include all candidates). For each selected customer_id, query the project table using exact matching on project.customer_id to retrieve all projects, regardless of status (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived). Compute the number of projects per customer_id. Searching for projects should tolerate potential data issues in customer references by verifying exact customer_id equality first; if none are found and ambiguity exists, optionally perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** checks on project.name and project.description containing the customer name as a fallback, but the primary metric should come from exact customer_id linkage.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_project_counts":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","project_count"]}}},"required":["customer_project_counts"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Here's a verification of my approach:

1. **Selected appropriate customer records**: From Step 1 and Step 2 results, I selected the exact matches:
   - BalkanRail Components: `cust_balkan_rail_components` (exact match, score 1.0)
   - Adriatic Marine Services Provider: `cust_adriatic_marine_services` (exact match, score 1.0)

2. **Verified customer details**: Retrieved full customer objects using `get_customer()` to confirm names.

3. **Counted projects using exact customer_id matching**: For each customer ID, I used `search_projects()` with `customer_id` parameter and `include_archived=True` to count ALL projects regardless of status. Used pagination to ensure complete results.

4. **Performed fallback checks**: As instructed, I performed broader searches using query parameters to check for projects that might reference customer names in project names or descriptions, which confirmed the same results.

5. **All data verified from function returns**: All customer IDs, names, and project counts were obtained directly from function returns (`get_customer()`, `search_projects()`). No data was made up or assumed.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

Result: Both customers have exactly 1 project each.

{
  "customer_project_counts": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkan_rail_components",
      "customer_name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "project_count": 1
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_adriatic_marine_services",
      "customer_name": "Adriatic Marine Services Provider",
      "project_count": 1
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
None should be linked, because BalkanRail Components and Adriatic Marine Services Provider each have exactly 1 project (it is a tie).

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
