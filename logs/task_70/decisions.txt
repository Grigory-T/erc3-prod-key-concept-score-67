DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:28:46
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous step (Step 1) successfully identified relevant customer records for 'BalkanRail Components', including an exact match, and performed all required fuzzy/semantic searches per the original plan. No discrepancies or missing information. Next, the plan requires executing the equivalent search for 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider' in Step 2 before proceeding to further steps. There are no unexpected results or the need for replanning. The task is progressing exactly as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:32:59
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 were both completed according to the original plan, accurately identifying the correct customer IDs for both 'BalkanRail Components' and 'Adriatic Marine Services Provider' with exact matches in each case. No errors, inconsistencies, or missing information were detected. The next step in the plan is to check user permissions, as prescribed, before moving to counting the projects. Since all results so far match the expected outputs and the plan remains fully executable, no replanning or final answer is warranted yet.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:36:43
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have so far returned results exactly as expected per the original plan. There is no missing information or unexpected result. User has full permissions, and customer matches are clear. The remaining steps (count projects for each customer and compare) can be completed as planned using the data and permissions available. No replanning is warranted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:40:04
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The previous steps were completed exactly as planned: both customer records were found as exact matches, access permissions were confirmed according to executive policy, and the project counts for each customer were reliably retrieved and verified using correct functions. Step 5 only requires a comparison: since both customers have exactly 1 project, they are tied. The original plan says in this case that no customer should be linked and the task ends. All requirements and expected results match exactly with what has been obtained, so the FINAL_ANSWER can be provided per the plan.
