DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:55:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has completed, producing a relevant and expected result that aligns fully with the original plan: the definition and context of 'SkillWillReflect' have been clarified, and operational parameters (such as rating scale and the general update process) have been confirmed. There is no unexpected result or gap, and the next steps (technical schema analysis) are logically ready. The remaining plan should not be changed: the outputs of Step 1 match expectations per the plan, and steps 2–7 are still appropriate to achieve the task. Therefore, I should continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:59:53
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All results so far are valid and directly aligned with the original step expectations and outputs. No inconsistencies, unexpected results, or obstacles have occurred. Each completed step yielded the required structure and information. The next logical action, as per the original plan, is to continue to Step 3. The current company rules and findings do not necessitate a replan. Therefore, proceeding to the next step is strictly in line with both the company policy and the original task plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:07:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced expected results matching the plan and company policies. There are no discrepancies, errors, or missing data so far. Step 4 (permissions check) relies on already gathered, accurate data—the user's system roles and context. All prior steps align well with the prescribed workflow, and there is nothing in the output so far indicating a need to replan. The task is progressing as intended and the remaining steps can be performed as planned.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:10:14
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps of the original plan executed successfully and returned results strictly matching the plan (semantics, expectations, and outputs). There have been no missing functions, missing data, or unexpected outputs, and no rule or policy violation has occurred. There are no discrepancies requiring changes—the rest of the plan remains executable. The next step (Step 5) is achievable as planned and all context so far permits proceeding as-is.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:13:00
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All executed steps so far have proceeded exactly according to the original plan, with expected results. The skill and will records were found, and their current levels are known (English skill at 2, Travel will at 6). There are no inconsistencies, errors, or missing information that would prevent the next steps from being executed. The next steps (applying the +1 and -1 updates while respecting level constraints) are straightforward continuations per the task's instructions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:15:08
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have produced the expected results without errors or discrepancies. The task is progressing according to the original step-by-step plan, with all actions taken strictly as instructed. Step 6 (skill_english +1) was executed successfully, verifying all updates and constraints. There are no inconsistencies or missing functionality, and the next step (Step 7: will_travel -1) can proceed as planned with all necessary information obtained. There is no reason to replan or abort.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 22:16:59
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed successfully, with all expected outputs achieved and no discrepancies encountered. Both skill and will updates were performed as described in the task, adhering strictly to company policies and technical constraints. There are no remaining steps or issues requiring replanning. Therefore, the task is complete and a final answer should be provided summarizing the results.
