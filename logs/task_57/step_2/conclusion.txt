I have successfully identified the technical implementation used to store and update employee skills and wills through a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the company's technical documentation. The implementation is documented in the systems/employee_registry.md file and related documentation. The employee registry is the authoritative source for employee data, including skills and wills, which are stored as lists of SkillLevel objects with name and level fields. Supported actions for managing skills and wills are defined in the company rules and include discrete operations for adding, updating, and removing both skills and wills.

{
  "implementation_found": true,
  "table_name": "employee_registry",
  "skill_fields": ["name", "level"],
  "will_fields": ["name", "level"],
  "supported_actions": ["AddSkill", "UpdateSkillLevel", "RemoveSkill", "AddWill", "UpdateWillLevel", "RemoveWill"]
}
