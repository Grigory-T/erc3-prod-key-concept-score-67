## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-14
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_133
User details: {"id": "6KR2_133", "name": "Camilla Marchetti", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** SkillWillReflect: +1 to skill_english and -1 for will_travel

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand what the term "SkillWillReflect" means in the company context and how it should be applied to skills and wills.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in the internal wiki and any company internal documentation for the term "SkillWillReflect" and close variants (e.g., "Skill Will Reflect", "skill_will_reflect"), accounting for possible typos or abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. From the best-matching documentation, extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_source":{"type":["string","null"]},"operational_rules":{"type":"string"}},"required":["definition_found","operational_rules"]}
**Result:** I executed the step instruction by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the company wiki for "SkillWillReflect" and close variants. I used the `search_wiki_fuzzy` function with terms ["SkillWillReflect", "skill_will_reflect", "skill will reflect", "Skill Will Reflect"] and found an exact match in hr/skills_and_wills_model.md. I loaded this file and searched the entire wiki using regex patterns for operational details, increment/decrement patterns, and update procedures. The documentation confirms that "SkillWillReflect update" is a process where employees update their skills and wills outside of formal reviews, but it does not provide specific operational rules for implementing adjustments like "+1 to skill_english" or "-1 for will_travel". The only operational context provided is the 1-10 rating scale and the principle of maintaining realistic ratings.

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "definition_source": "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md",
  "operational_rules": "The documentation states that SkillWillReflect is an update process where employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of formal reviews. It does not specify concrete operational rules for implementing adjustments (like +1 or -1 increments). The only established rules are the 1-10 rating scale and the principle of maintaining realistic ratings."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Identify the technical implementation used to store and update employee skills and wills in order to know how to apply SkillWillReflect operations.
Approach: Using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation, database schema descriptions, and available APIs, confirm which tables, fields, and actions are responsible for skills and wills management (e.g., the employee_skill table with skill_type = 'skill' or 'will', and actions such as AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel). If multiple candidate mechanisms are found, select the one explicitly referenced for operational skill and will updates.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"will_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supported_actions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["implementation_found","table_name","skill_fields","will_fields","supported_actions"]}

I'll execute step 2 by searching the technical documentation to identify the implementation for storing and updating employee skills and wills.

# Employee Registry

The **employee registry** is the authoritative source for information about **people** at Bellini Coatings.

## What is stored in the employee registry?

For each employee:

- Employee ID (internal unique identifier)
- Full name
- Auto‑generated email address
- Salary (confidential)
- Free‑text notes (HR/internal use)
- Location (e.g. “HQ – Italy”, “Serbian Plant”, “Munich Office”)
- Department (one of the standard departments)
- Skills (list of `SkillLevel` entries)
- Wills (list of `SkillLevel` entries)

Skills and wills are documented in detail in [Skills & Wills Model](../hr/skills_and_wills_model.md).

## Who can see what?

- **All employees (via chatbot):**
  - Name, email, location, department and basic role.
  - Selected skill and will information, depending on context.
- **Managers and HR:**
  - Full profile, including notes and salary.
- **IT & system processes:**
  - Use employee IDs and department/location to enforce access and routing rules.

Access is controlled by **system roles** and internal policies. The chatbot respects these rules and will not reveal confidential information (such as exact salaries) to unauthorised users.

## How data gets into the registry

- When an employee is hired, HR creates a record with:
  - Initial notes
  - Location
  - Department
  - Salary
  - Initial skills and wills
- Updates happen through:
  - HR changes (e.g. promotions, relocations, salary adjustments).
  - Manager and employee updates during reviews (skills and wills).
  - System events (e.g. location updates based on site changes).

Each significant change is recorded with “changed by” information for auditing.

## Typical usage

- **HR and managers**
  - Look up reporting lines, salary ranges (where allowed), and skill distributions.
- **Project staffing**
  - Find people with specific skills at certain levels (e.g. “epoxy floor systems ≥ 7”).
- **Cross‑site collaboration**
  - Identify experts in other locations or departments.
- **Chatbot queries**
  - “Who is the plant manager in Serbia?”
  - “Which employees report to the R&D Director?”
  - “Show Sara Romano’s skills and current department.”

Accurate employee records are essential for planning, analytics and for the chatbot to be helpful.

Now I need to analyze all the information gathered and determine the technical implementation for storing and updating employee skills and wills. Let me examine the specific results more carefully.

```python
# Let me check the chatbot interface file more thoroughly since it mentioned update actions
print("Examining chatbot interface file for specific API actions...")
chatbot_file = "systems/chatbot_interface.md"
if chatbot_file in wiki_files:
    content = load_wiki(chatbot_file)
    if content:
        # Look for specific action definitions
        lines = content.split('\n')
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if 'skill' in line.lower() or 'will' in line.lower() or 'action' in line.lower():
                print(f"Line {i+1}: {line}")

# Let me also check the company rules from the initial context
print("\n\nAnalyzing company rules for skill/will actions...")
# From the initial context, I can see rules mentioning:
# - AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill
print("Company rules mention these actions for EmployeeProfile:")
print("  - AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill")
print("  - AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill")

# Let me also check the data structures
print("\n\nAnalyzing data structures for skills/wills storage...")
print("From EmployeeFull data structure:")
print("  - skills: list[SkillLevel]")
print("  - wills: list[SkillLevel]")
print("SkillLevel object: name (str), level (int)")

# Let me check if there's any documentation about how updates work
print("\n\nSearching for update procedures in wiki...")
update_search = search_wiki(r"update.*skill|skill.*update|update.*will|will.*update")
if update_search:
    for res in update_search:
        print(f"\nFile: {res['path']}, Line: {res['linum']}")
        print(f"Content: {res['content']}")

# Based on the employee registry documentation, let me extract the key information
print("\n\nSummarizing findings from employee registry documentation...")
print("From systems/employee_registry.md:")
print("1. The employee registry stores employee profiles")
print("2. Each employee has:")
print("   - Employee ID, Full name, Email, Salary, Notes, Location, Department")
print("   - Skills (list of SkillLevel entries)")
print("   - Wills (list of SkillLevel entries)")

print("Note: skills/wills must be list of dicts: [{'name': 'skill_name', 'level': value}]")

# Based on all findings, I need to determine:
# 1. Table name
# 2. Skill fields
# 3. Will fields
# 4. Supported actions
print("\n\nDetermining technical implementation based on all evidence...")

# From the documentation, it seems the employee registry is the main storage
# Skills and wills are stored as part of employee records, not in separate tables
# The actions are mentioned in the company rules

# Let me create a comprehensive analysis
print("Analysis:")
print("1. Implementation found: YES")
print("2. Table name: 'employee_registry' (as per systems/employee_registry.md)")
print("3. Skill fields: ['name', 'level'] (from SkillLevel object)")
print("4. Will fields: ['name', 'level'] (same structure as skills)")
print("5. Supported actions: ['AddSkill', 'UpdateSkillLevel', 'RemoveSkill', 'AddWill', 'UpdateWillLevel', 'RemoveWill'] (from company rules)")

Code execution result:
STDOUT:
Examining chatbot interface file for specific API actions...
Line 3: The **chatbot** is a modern, conversational interface that sits on top of Bellini’s legacy systems (CRM, project registry, employee registry, time tracking and wiki). It allows employees to **ask questions in natural language** and, in some cases, perform simple actions.
Line 10:   - Employees, departments, skills and locations.
Line 13: - Perform selected actions (depending on permissions):
Line 14:   - Update employee info (location, department, skills and wills, notes).
Line 46: - `skill_id` or `will_id` - skills/wills.
Line 50: ## Examples of interactions
Line 70:   - Action: system updates employee location and emits an event.


Analyzing company rules for skill/will actions...
Company rules mention these actions for EmployeeProfile:
  - AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill
  - AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill


Analyzing data structures for skills/wills storage...
From EmployeeFull data structure:
  - skills: list[SkillLevel]
  - wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel object: name (str), level (int)


Searching for update procedures in wiki...

File: company/organization_and_hierarchy.md, Line: 81
Content: - Ensuring that **projects** in their area have clear owners.
- Checking that **time tracking** for their team is complete and reasonable.
- Encouraging team members to keep their **skills and wills** profiles updated.

The hierarchy is respected, but day‑to‑day collaboration is informal and often cross‑functional, especially between **Sales, R&D and Operations** on customer projects.

File: hr/skills_and_wills_model.md, Line: 31
Content: ## Principles for keeping profiles up to date

- **Employees and managers** update skills and wills during annual reviews and as needed after major changes (new responsibilities, training, relocations).
- Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**.
- HR encourages **realistic ratings**: it is acceptable to have some high scores, but profiles should reflect reality, not wishful thinking.

- Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**.
- HR encourages **realistic ratings**: it is acceptable to have some high scores, but profiles should reflect reality, not wishful thinking.
- Wills are particularly important for:

File: systems/employee_registry.md, Line: 43
Content: - Updates happen through:
  - HR changes (e.g. promotions, relocations, salary adjustments).
  - Manager and employee updates during reviews (skills and wills).
  - System events (e.g. location updates based on site changes).



Summarizing findings from employee registry documentation...
From systems/employee_registry.md:
1. The employee registry stores employee profiles
2. Each employee has:
   - Employee ID, Full name, Email, Salary, Notes, Location, Department
   - Skills (list of SkillLevel entries)
   - Wills (list of SkillLevel entries)
3. Skills and wills are stored as lists of SkillLevel objects
4. SkillLevel has fields: name and level


Checking update_employee_info function implementation...
Function: update_employee_info(employee_id, notes=None, salary=None, skills=None, wills=None, location=None, department=None, changed_by=None)
Note: skills/wills must be list of dicts: [{'name': 'skill_name', 'level': value}]


Determining technical implementation based on all evidence...
Analysis:
1. Implementation found: YES
2. Table name: 'employee_registry' (as per systems/employee_registry.md)
3. Skill fields: ['name', 'level'] (from SkillLevel object)
4. Will fields: ['name', 'level'] (same structure as skills)
5. Supported actions: ['AddSkill', 'UpdateSkillLevel', 'RemoveSkill', 'AddWill', 'UpdateWillLevel', 'RemoveWill'] (from company rules)

Based on my comprehensive search and analysis of the company's technical documentation, I have identified the technical implementation for storing and updating employee skills and wills. Here are my findings:

<final_answer>
I have successfully identified the technical implementation used to store and update employee skills and wills through a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the company's technical documentation. The implementation is documented in the systems/employee_registry.md file and related documentation. The employee registry is the authoritative source for employee data, including skills and wills, which are stored as lists of SkillLevel objects with name and level fields. Supported actions for managing skills and wills are defined in the company rules and include discrete operations for adding, updating, and removing both skills and wills.
</final_answer>

<json>
{
  "implementation_found": true,
  "table_name": "employee_registry",
  "skill_fields": ["name", "level"],
  "will_fields": ["name", "level"],
  "supported_actions": ["AddSkill", "UpdateSkillLevel", "RemoveSkill", "AddWill", "UpdateWillLevel", "RemoveWill"]
}</json>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[USER] (message 9)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Identify the technical implementation used to store and update employee skills and wills in order to know how to apply SkillWillReflect operations.
Approach: Using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation, database schema descriptions, and available APIs, confirm which tables, fields, and actions are responsible for skills and wills management (e.g., the employee_skill table with skill_type = 'skill' or 'will', and actions such as AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel). If multiple candidate mechanisms are found, select the one explicitly referenced for operational skill and will updates.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"will_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supported_actions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["implementation_found","table_name","skill_fields","will_fields","supported_actions"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
