Step 2: Identify the technical implementation used to store and update employee skills and wills in order to know how to apply SkillWillReflect operations.
Approach: Using a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over technical documentation, database schema descriptions, and available APIs, confirm which tables, fields, and actions are responsible for skills and wills management (e.g., the employee_skill table with skill_type = 'skill' or 'will', and actions such as AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel). If multiple candidate mechanisms are found, select the one explicitly referenced for operational skill and will updates.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"table_name":{"type":"string"},"skill_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"will_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"supported_actions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["implementation_found","table_name","skill_fields","will_fields","supported_actions"]}
