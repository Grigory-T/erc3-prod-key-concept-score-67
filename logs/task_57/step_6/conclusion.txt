Step 6 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Retrieved current employee record**: Used `get_employee("6KR2_133")` to obtain Camilla Marchetti's full profile, including current skill levels.

2. **Found skill_english**: Located the skill "skill_english" in her skills list with current level 2 (verified from function return).

3. **Calculated new level**: Computed new_level = old_level + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3.

4. **Checked constraints**: Verified new level 3 is within the 1-5 range mentioned in the step description.

5. **Performed update**: Called `update_employee_info()` to update the skill level from 2 to 3. This required full replacement of all employee fields, so I preserved all existing data:
   - Notes: "" (empty string)
   - Salary: 47000 (from original employee record)
   - Location: "HQ – Italy" 
   - Department: "Human Resources (HR)"
   - Skills: Updated list with skill_english level changed to 3
   - Wills: Original wills list unchanged

6. **Verified update**: Retrieved the updated employee record with `get_employee("6KR2_133")` and confirmed skill_english level is now 3.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Old level 2 came from `employee.skills` list
- New level 3 was calculated and verified
- Update success confirmed by the system message and verification check
- No assumptions were made - all data came from actual function calls

The state-changing function `update_employee_info` was called only once as required.
