Step 6: Apply "+1 to skill_english" by updating the English skill level for the target employee, respecting the employee_skill level constraints.
Approach: If the English skill record was found in the previous step, compute the new level as current_level + 1 and perform an UpdateSkillLevel action or an equivalent UPDATE on the employee_skill row with skill_type = 'skill'. Be aware that the database constraint enforces level BETWEEN 1 AND 5; the execution layer must handle any constraint violation if the new level exceeds allowed bounds. If the English skill record was not found, record that the update could not be applied without creating new rules, and do not create a new skill record (to adhere strictly to the literal task).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"attempted":{"type":"boolean"},"success":{"type":"boolean"},"english_skill_id":{"type":["integer","null"]},"old_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"new_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["attempted","success","english_skill_id","old_level","new_level","error_message"]}
