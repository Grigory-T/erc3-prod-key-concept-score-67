Step 4: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user to update skills and wills for the target employee according to company rules.
Approach: Using the identity and role information from the previous step and the company authorization rules for actions {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} on EmployeeProfile, evaluate whether the current user (id 6KR2_133) is allowed to modify skill and will entries for the target employee. Specifically, verify if user.id == target_employee.id or user.system_roles intersects {'HRAdmin','Manager'} is non-empty. Use only the bound identity from EmployeeRegistry, with no privilege escalation. Produce a boolean decision and a non-sensitive explanation string.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"permitted":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["permitted","reason"]}
