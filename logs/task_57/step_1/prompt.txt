Step 1: Understand what the term "SkillWillReflect" means in the company context and how it should be applied to skills and wills.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in the internal wiki and any company internal documentation for the term "SkillWillReflect" and close variants (e.g., "Skill Will Reflect", "skill_will_reflect"), accounting for possible typos or abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. From the best-matching documentation, extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel".
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_source":{"type":["string","null"]},"operational_rules":{"type":"string"}},"required":["definition_found","operational_rules"]}
