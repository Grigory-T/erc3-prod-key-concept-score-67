--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in Step 1 of a task. The goal is to search for the term "SkillWillReflect" in the company's internal wiki and documentation.

 We are to perform a fuzzy and semantic search. We have the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` that can search for words in the wiki.
 Also, we can list the wiki files and load them to search manually if needed.

 Approach:
 1. List all wiki files to see what we have.
 2. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` to search for the term "SkillWillReflect" and possible variants.
 3. Also, we can try to load the most promising files and look for the term manually, but the fuzzy search should help.

 However, note: the term might be written in different ways (with underscores, spaces, CamelCase, etc.). We can try:
   - "SkillWillReflect"
   - "skill_will_reflect"
   - "skill will reflect"

 We can also try breaking it into words: ["skill", "will", "reflect"] and search for each, but the fuzzy search function takes a list of words and returns matches for each.

 Let's use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the word "SkillWillReflect" and then also with the broken-down words.

 But note: the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` is fuzzy, so it should account for typos and variations.

 Steps:

 1. Get the current user context to use for `changed_by` if needed, but for search we don't need it.
 2. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the word "SkillWillReflect" and maybe also with the broken down words.

 However, the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` only returns matches for individual words. We want to find the phrase.

 Alternatively, we can use `fuzzy_find_in_text` but we need the texts. We can load each wiki file and use `fuzzy_find_in_text` on the content.

 But we have a function `search_wiki` that uses regex. We can try a regex pattern that allows for spaces and underscores.

 Let's try:

   search_wiki(query_regex="Skill.*Will.*Reflect")  -> This will match "Skill Will Reflect", "SkillWillReflect", "Skill_Will_Reflect", etc.

 However, note that `search_wiki` uses regex and is case-sensitive? We don't know. Let's assume it is.

 We can also try to list all wiki files and then load each one and search with `fuzzy_find_in_text` for the phrase.

 We have to consider the balance between thoroughness and time. Let's start with `search_wiki_fuzzy`.

 Since the step says "Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search", we should use the fuzzy functions.

 Plan:

  a) Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the word "SkillWillReflect" and see what we get.
  b) If that doesn't yield a clear result, break it into words and search for each, then look for files that contain all three.

 We can also use `fuzzy_compare` to compare the phrase against the file names, but the phrase might be in the content.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll do:

   results1 = search_wiki_fuzzy(["SkillWillReflect"], top_n=10, context_chars=200)

 Then, we can also try:

   results2 = search_wiki_fuzzy(["skill", "will", "reflect"], top_n=10, context_chars=200)

 We'll then examine the results and see if any of the matches are about the SkillWillReflect concept.

 We are also allowed to load the wiki files and read them if the fuzzy search doesn't give enough context.

 Expected Output: We need to output a JSON with:
   - definition_found: boolean
   - definition_source: string (the wiki file path) or null if not found
   - operational_rules: string (the description of how SkillWillReflect events translate into operations)

 We'll extract the operational rules from the best matching wiki content.

 If we find a wiki page that defines SkillWillReflect, we can load it and extract the rules.

 Let's proceed step by step.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 21:48:25
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I need to search for "SkillWillReflect" in the wiki. I'll start with a fuzzy search on the wiki content.
 The search_wiki_fuzzy function allows me to search for words in wiki content with fuzzy matching.
 I'll also check the most relevant wiki files, especially hr/skills_and_wills_model.md, as it's likely to contain information about skills and wills.

 Let's perform a fuzzy search for the term "SkillWillReflect" and its variants.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #3] 2025-12-09 21:48:53
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have a perfect match for "SkillWillReflect" in the wiki file `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` at line 32. Let's load that entire file to get more context and understand the operational rules.

```python
# Load the entire skills_and_wills_model.md file for context
content = load_wiki("hr/skills_and_wills_model.md")
print("=== Content of hr/skills_and_wills_model.md ===")
print(content)
```
Now, we need to extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records. We'll look for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel" in the wiki.

Let me also search for any other mentions of SkillWillReflect in the wiki using regex search to ensure we don't miss any details.

```python
# Search for SkillWillReflect using regex to find all occurrences
regex_results = search_wiki(query_regex="SkillWillReflect")
print("Regex search results for 'SkillWillReflect':")
for result in regex_results:
    print(f"File: {result['path']}, Line: {result['linum']}")
    print(f"Content: {result['content']}")
    print("-" * 50)
```

But note: the fuzzy search already found the term in `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md`. Let me load that file and then search within it for operational rules.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #4] 2025-12-09 21:49:25
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found a mention of "SkillWillReflect update" in the context of updating skills and wills outside of reviews. However, the step asks for operational rules, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". The current document does not elaborate on the exact meaning of "SkillWillReflect" events.

We should search further in the wiki for more details. Let's search for other occurrences of "SkillWillReflect" or similar patterns.

We already saw the term in line 32. Let's search the wiki for "SkillWillReflect" using a regex search to see if there are any other mentions in other files. We'll use `search_wiki` with a regex pattern.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #5] 2025-12-09 21:50:01
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We found a reference to "SkillWillReflect update" in the skills_and_wills_model.md file, but the documentation does not explicitly define the term or provide operational rules for how to handle patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". However, based on the context, we can infer that "SkillWillReflect" is a process or event where employees update their skills and wills. The patterns "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel" likely mean increasing the level of a skill by 1 and decreasing the level of a will by 1, respectively.

We should also check other wiki files for any additional context. Let's load the people_and_roles.md file to see if there's more information.

But note: the step asks for a fuzzy and semantic search. We've done fuzzy search and found the term. We also need to extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations.

Since the documentation is sparse, we can infer from the context of the skills and wills model. The operational rules would be:

- SkillWillReflect events are updates to employee skill and will levels.
- The updates are done by the employee or their manager (as per the principles).
- The updates should respect the 1-10 scale and be realistic.
- The updates are stored as lists of SkillLevel objects, sorted alphabetically by name.

We should also check if there's any other documentation about update procedures. Let's search for "update" in the wiki.

However, the step says to perform a fuzzy and semantic search for the term and extract operational rules from the best-matching documentation. We have found the term in the skills_and_wills_model.md file, and we can extract the operational rules from the context of that document.

Let me also search for "update" in the skills_and_wills_model.md file to see if there are more details.

But note: the step requires us to output a JSON with definition_found, definition_source, and operational_rules.

We have definition_found: True (since we found the term in the wiki).
Definition_source: "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md"
Operational_rules: We need to write a string describing how SkillWillReflect events translate into operations.

From the document, we can extract:

- SkillWillReflect is an update process that employees are encouraged to do outside of reviews.
- It involves updating skill and will levels.
- The updates should reflect reality (realistic ratings).
- The scale is 1-10, with 10 being the maximum.

For the specific patterns "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel", we can infer:

- For a skill: increase the level by 1, but not exceeding 10.
- For a will: decrease the level by 1, but not below 1.

However, the document does not explicitly state these rules. We must base our operational rules only on what is in the documentation.

Let me check if there are any other wiki files that might contain more details about SkillWillReflect. We can search for "SkillWillReflect" in all wiki files using a broader search.

But note: we already did a fuzzy search and found the term only in one file. Let's do a direct search in the entire wiki for the exact term.

We can load all wiki files and check for the term, but the fuzzy search already covered that. However, we can do a simple text search in the loaded content of the skills_and_wills_model.md file for the term and see the context.

We already have the full content of that file. Let me search for "SkillWillReflect" in that content and extract a few lines around it.

But note: the step says to use fuzzy and semantic search. We have done that. Now we need to extract the operational rules.

Given that the documentation is limited, we can only report what we found.

Let me also check the employee registry documentation to see if there are any update procedures.

```python
# Load the employee_registry.md file to see if there are update procedures
employee_registry_content = load_wiki("systems/employee_registry.md")
print("=== Checking systems/employee_registry.md for update procedures ===\n")
print(employee_registry_content[:1000])  # First 1000 characters

We have found one mention of "SkillWillReflect update" in the skills_and_wills_model.md file, but it doesn't give operational rules for how such updates are applied, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". We need to look for more documentation about the update process, perhaps in the employee registry documentation or in system update procedures.

Let's load the employee_registry.md file to see if it contains update rules.

[REASONING #7] 2025-12-09 21:51:10

We need to extract the definition and operational rules for SkillWillReflect. From the fuzzy search, we found a match in hr/skills_and_wills_model.md line 32, which says: "Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**."

However, we need to understand how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". The documentation doesn't explicitly state the operational rules. We might need to look for other references, perhaps in example employee profiles or other HR documentation.

Let's examine the example employee profiles to see if there are any illustrative examples of SkillWillReflect updates.

```python
# Load the example employee profiles
example_profiles = load_wiki("hr/example_employee_profiles.md")
print("=== Content of hr/example_employee_profiles.md ===\n")

[REASONING #8] 2025-12-09 21:51:29
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found the term "SkillWillReflect" in the wiki. It is mentioned in the skills_and_wills_model.md file as part of "SkillWillReflect update". However, the documentation does not provide explicit operational rules for how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel".

We need to infer from the context. The term appears in the section "Principles for keeping profiles up to date". It says employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of "SkillWillReflect update". This suggests that SkillWillReflect is a type of update event where employees reflect on their skills and wills and make adjustments.

Given the task pattern "+1 to skill_english and -1 for will_travel", it likely means increasing the level of a skill by 1 and decreasing the level of a will by 1. However, we should check if there are any other references in the wiki or other documentation that might explain the operational rules.

Let's search for any other references to increments or decrements in skill/will levels.

```python
# Search for patterns like "+1", "-1", "increment", "decrement" in the wiki
increment_pattern = r"\+[0-9]|-[0-9]|increment|decrement"
increment_results = search_wiki(query_regex=increment_pattern)
print(f"Found {len(increment_results)} matches for increment/decrement patterns:")
for result in increment_results[:20]:
    print(f"File: {result['path']}, Line: {result['linum']}")

[REASONING #9] 2025-12-09 21:51:51
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have searched the wiki for "SkillWillReflect" and found it mentioned in the skills_and_wills_model.md file. The term appears in the context of employees being encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as part of a "SkillWillReflect update". However, we haven't found explicit documentation on how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations (like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel").

We need to interpret the operational rules from the available documentation. Let's re-examine the skills_and_wills_model.md file and the employee registry to understand the update process.

From the skills_and_wills_model.md:
- Skills and wills are stored as `SkillLevel` objects with a name and a level (1-10).
- The maximum level is 10.
- Employees and managers update skills and wills during annual reviews and as needed.
- Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as part of a "SkillWillReflect update".

The task is to understand how SkillWillReflect events translate into operations. Given the patterns "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel", it seems that SkillWillReflect involves adjusting the level of a skill or will by a certain amount (increment or decrement). However, we must note that the level is on a scale of 1-10, so adjustments must stay within that range.

We also need to consider the company rules regarding who can update skills and wills. According to the rules:
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;

So, the user (or HR/Manager) can update the skill/will levels.

Given the lack of explicit documentation on the exact meaning of SkillWillReflect, we must infer from the context. The term "reflect" suggests that it is an update to reflect changes in skills or interests. The patterns "+1" and "-1" indicate incremental adjustments.

Let's check if there are any other documents that might contain the term "SkillWillReflect" or similar. We already did a fuzzy search and found the term only in the skills_and_wills_model.md. We also did a regex search for increment/decrement patterns and found nothing.

We can also check the chatbot_interface.md or other system documentation for any mention of SkillWillReflect.

```python
# Load chatbot_interface.md
chatbot_content = load_wiki("systems/chatbot_interface.md")
print("=== Content of systems/chatbot_interface.md ===\n")
print(chatbot_content)

We have found that the term "SkillWillReflect" is mentioned in the skills_and_wills_model.md file. 
 The exact context is: "Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**."

 However, the step requires understanding of how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel".

 From the available documentation, we don't have explicit rules for such patterns. However, we can infer from the context:

 1. The SkillWillReflect update is a process by which employees update their skills and wills outside of regular reviews.
 2. The patterns "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel" suggest that SkillWillReflect events might involve incrementing or decrementing the level of a skill or will by 1.

 Since there's no explicit documentation on the operational rules, we can only base our answer on what we found.

 Let's search for any other mentions of SkillWillReflect in other wiki files to see if there are more details.

 We'll also check the index and any other HR-related files.

[REASONING #11] 2025-12-09 21:53:02

We have found the term "SkillWillReflect" in the wiki. The documentation states: 
"Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**."

However, the step asks for how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". 

From the available documentation, we don't have explicit rules for these operations. The documentation only mentions that SkillWillReflect is a type of update that employees can do outside of reviews. We need to infer from the context and the available functions.

Given that the company uses a 1-10 scale for both skills and wills, and the examples in the task are "+1" and "-1", it likely means incrementing or decrementing the level of a skill or will by 1. 

But the step is to understand what the term means and how it should be applied. Since the wiki doesn't provide explicit operational rules, we must base our answer on what we found.

Let me also check if there is any other documentation about updates in the employee registry or chatbot interface that might give more clues.

We can also look at the update_employee_info function to understand how skills and wills are updated.

However, the step is only to search the wiki and documentation. We have done that.

We found one definition: SkillWillReflect is an update that employees can do outside of reviews to update their skills and wills.

We have not found explicit rules for "+1" and "-1" operations. 

But we can infer from the context that:
- Skills and wills are represented as SkillLevel objects with a name and level (1-10).
- The "+1 to skill_english" likely means increasing the level of the skill "english" by 1.
- The "-1 for will_travel" likely means decreasing the level of the will "travel" by 1.

However, we must note the 1-10 scale and that the levels must stay within 1-10.

We also note from the company rules that employees can update their own skills and wills, and HR/managers can also update them.

Therefore, the operational rule for SkillWillReflect events is that they are updates to an employee's skills and wills, typically by adjusting the level of a specific skill or will by a certain amount (like +1 or -1), within the 1-10 scale.

But since the wiki doesn't explicitly state this, we must be cautious.

Let me re-read the step: 
"Step 1: Understand what the term "SkillWillReflect" means in the company context and how it should be applied to skills and wills.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in the internal wiki and any company internal documentation for the term "SkillWillReflect" and close variants ... From the best-matching documentation, extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel"."

We have done the search and found the definition. We did not find explicit operational rules for the patterns. 

We must answer based on what we found.

Thus, the output should indicate that we found a definition, but the operational rules are not explicitly documented. We can only state what we found and infer from the context.

However, note that the expected output requires an "operational_rules" string. We must provide something.

Given the above, I will answer:

- definition_found: True
- definition_source: "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md"
- operational_rules: "SkillWillReflect is an update that employees can perform outside of regular reviews to adjust their skills and wills. The update involves modifying the level of a specific skill or will by a specified amount (e.g., +1 or -1) within the 1-10 scale, ensuring the new level remains within 1-10."

But wait, the step says "extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations". We are extracting from the documentation. The documentation only says it's an update. We are inferring the rest.

Alternatively, we can say that the operational rules are not explicitly documented, but from the context and the task, we assume that it means adjusting the level of a skill or will by the specified amount.

However, the step expects a string for operational_rules. We must provide one.

Let me check if there is any other documentation about updates. Maybe in the chatbot interface or employee registry, there are examples of how updates are done.

We have seen the update_employee_info function, which requires a full replace. But that is a system function, not documentation.

We are only allowed to use the wiki and documentation.

I will run one more search for "update skills" in the wiki to see if there are any examples.

```python
# Search for "update skills" in the wiki
update_skills_results = search_wiki(query_regex=r"update.*skill|skill.*update")
print(f"Found {len(update_skills_results)} matches for update skills:")
for result in update_skills_results[:10]:
    print(f"File: {result['path']}, Line: {result['linum']}")
    print(f"Content: {result['content']}")
    print("-" * 50)

We have searched the wiki extensively and found that the term "SkillWillReflect" appears only in the skills_and_wills_model.md file.
 The context is: "Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**."

 However, the step asks for operational rules, especially for patterns like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". 
 We have not found explicit documentation on such patterns in the wiki.

 Let me check if there are any other systems or documentation that might explain the operational rules.
 Since the step requires fuzzy and semantic search, and we have already done that, we might need to infer the operational rules from the context.

 But note: The step says to "extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations on employee_skill records".

 Since we don't have explicit documentation, we can note that the documentation mentions:
   - Skills and wills are updated during annual reviews and as needed.
   - Employees are encouraged to update outside of reviews as part of SkillWillReflect update.
   - Ratings are on a 1-10 scale.

 However, we don't have explicit rules for "+1" or "-1" operations.

 Let me check the example employee profiles to see if there are any patterns of changes, but they are static examples.

 Alternatively, we can look at the available functions for updating employee info to understand the data model.

 But note: The step is about understanding the term and how it should be applied. Since we don't have explicit documentation, we might have to state that the definition was found but operational rules for incremental changes are not explicitly documented.

 However, the step expects an output with operational_rules. We can infer from the context and the available functions that:
   - Skills and wills are stored as SkillLevel objects with a level (1-10).
   - Updates can be made by employees, managers, or HR.
   - The term "SkillWillReflect" seems to refer to an update process outside of formal reviews.

 But the specific pattern "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel" suggests incrementing or decrementing the level of a skill or will.

 Since the system uses a 1-10 scale, and the update_employee_info function requires a full replace, the operational rule for such a pattern would be:
   - For "+1 to skill_english": find the current level of the skill "english" in the employee's skills, increment by 1 (but not exceeding 10), and update the entire skills list.
   - Similarly for "-1 for will_travel": decrement the level of the will "travel" by 1 (but not below 1) and update the entire wills list.

 However, this is an inference, not an explicit rule from documentation.

 Let me search for any other terms that might be related, such as "increment" or "decrement", but we already did that and found no matches.

 We have to base our answer on what we found.

 So, we can say:
   - definition_found: True (we found the term in the wiki)
   - definition_source: "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md"
   - operational_rules: Based on the documentation and the system's data model, SkillWillReflect events are updates to an employee's skills and wills outside of formal reviews. The skills and wills are represented as SkillLevel objects with a level from 1 to 10. The update is performed by replacing the entire skills or wills list with the updated levels. For patterns like "+1 to skill_english", the current level of the skill is incremented by 1 (capped at 10). For "-1 for will_travel", the current level of the will is decremented by 1 (capped at 1).

 However, the step says "extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations". We don't have explicit extraction, so we are inferring.

 Alternatively, we can say that the operational rules are not explicitly documented beyond the general update process.

 But the step requires operational_rules. We must provide something.

 Let me check the company rules in the initial context for any additional information.

 The initial context has company rules, but they are about permissions and access, not about the meaning of SkillWillReflect.

 Given the above, I will proceed to formulate the answer.

 Note: The step is step 1 of a larger task. We are only required to understand the term and operational rules.

 We have:
   - Found the term in the wiki.
   - The term is used in the context of updating skills and wills outside of reviews.

 We can infer the operational rules from the system's data model and the example patterns.

 However, let me double-check by looking at the update_employee_info function signature and the SkillLevel object.

 The update_employee_info function requires a list of dicts for skills and wills, each with 'name' and 'level'. The level is an integer.

 So, the operational rule for "+1 to skill_english" would be:
   - Get the current employee profile.
   - In the skills list, find the entry with name "english".
   - Increment its level by 1, ensuring it does not exceed 10.
   - Then call update_employee_info with the updated list.

 Similarly for "-1 for will_travel".

 We can state that.

 Since we are to provide operational rules, we can write a concise description.

 Let me craft the final answer.

[REASONING #13] 2025-12-09 21:54:44
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found the term "SkillWillReflect" in the wiki, specifically in hr/skills_and_wills_model.md. The documentation states:

"Employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of reviews as well, as a part of **SkillWillReflect update**."

However, the documentation does not explicitly define how a SkillWillReflect event translates into concrete operations like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". We need to infer the operational rules from the context.

From the documentation, we know:
1. Skills and wills are stored as `SkillLevel` objects with `name` and `level` (1-10 scale).
2. The maximum level is 10.
3. Updates can be done by employees and managers.
4. The system expects realistic ratings.

Given the context of the task (SkillWillReflect: +1 to skill_english and -1 for will_travel), it seems that a SkillWillReflect event involves adjusting the level of a skill or will by a certain amount (increment or decrement). The example in the task suggests:
- For a skill: increase the level by 1 (but not exceeding the maximum of 10).
- For a will: decrease the level by 1 (but not below the minimum of 1).

However, we must note that the wiki does not explicitly define the exact rules for such adjustments. We must base our answer solely on the available documentation.

Since we have found a definition of SkillWillReflect (as a type of update), but no explicit operational rules, we should state that the definition was found but the operational rules are not explicitly documented. However, we can infer from the context and the example in the task that the operational rules involve incrementing or decrementing the level of a skill or will by the specified amount, respecting the 1-10 scale.

But note: the task says "Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search ... From the best-matching documentation, extract how SkillWillReflect events translate into concrete operations ..."

We have performed the search and the best-matching documentation only mentions SkillWillReflect as a type of update, without concrete rules. Therefore, we cannot extract explicit operational rules from the documentation.

We must output:
{
  "definition_found": true,
  "definition_source": "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md",
  "operational_rules": "Not explicitly documented in the wiki. However, based on context, a SkillWillReflect event likely involves adjusting the level of a skill or will by the specified amount (positive or negative) while respecting the 1-10 scale and the principle of realistic ratings."
}

But wait, the expected output requires "operational_rules" to be a string. We must provide what we can infer from the documentation and the context of the task.

Alternatively, we can note that the documentation does not specify the exact operations, so we cannot extract them.

Let me re-read the documentation to see if there are any other clues.

From the skills_and_wills_model.md, we have the rating scale and principles. The example employee profiles show skills and wills with levels, but no examples of updates.

Given that the task is about understanding what SkillWillReflect means, and we have found it in the documentation, we can say:

- Definition found: Yes, in hr/skills_and_wills_model.md.
- Operational rules: Not explicitly defined, but the context suggests that employees can update their skills and wills (changing the level) as part of a SkillWillReflect update. The example in the task ( +1 to skill_english and -1 for will_travel) implies that the update is performed by adjusting the level by the specified delta, ensuring the new level remains within 1-10.

We must be cautious not to invent rules that are not documented. However, the task expects us to extract from the documentation. Since the documentation does not specify the exact operations, we can only state what we found.

Let me check if there are any other documents that might contain the information. We have already searched all wiki files and only found one mention.

Therefore, I will output:

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "definition_source": "hr/skills_and_wills_model.md",
  "operational_rules": "SkillWillReflect is a type of update where employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of formal reviews. The documentation does not specify the exact operations for adjusting skill and will levels, but the example in the task suggests that a SkillWillReflect event may involve incrementing or decrementing the level of a skill or will by a specified amount, respecting the 1-10 scale."
}

But note: the expected output format says: 
{
  "definition_found": boolean,
  "definition_source": string or null,
  "operational_rules": string
}

We must provide a string for operational_rules. We cannot leave it as null.

Given the above, I will proceed.

We have performed the step as requested. Let me verify our actions:

1. We executed the step instruction: Performed fuzzy and semantic search for "SkillWillReflect" and variants.
2. We used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with terms: ["SkillWillReflect", "skill_will_reflect", "skill will reflect", "Skill Will Reflect"].
3. We found a match in `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` with exact term "SkillWillReflect" (ratio 1.0).
4. We loaded the full content of that file and searched for operational rules.
5. We also searched for patterns like "+1", "-1", increment, decrement, and update procedures in other wiki files.
6. We found that the documentation does not specify concrete operational rules for how SkillWillReflect events translate into operations like "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel". It only mentions that employees are encouraged to update skills and wills as part of SkillWillReflect updates, with realistic ratings on a 1-10 scale.

We did not skip any actions. We verified all facts from function returns. We did not use any made-up data. We did not change any state.

Thus, our conclusion stands. Let me provide the final answer and JSON.
