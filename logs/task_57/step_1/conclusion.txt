I executed the step instruction by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the company wiki for "SkillWillReflect" and close variants. I used the `search_wiki_fuzzy` function with terms ["SkillWillReflect", "skill_will_reflect", "skill will reflect", "Skill Will Reflect"] and found an exact match in hr/skills_and_wills_model.md. I loaded this file and searched the entire wiki using regex patterns for operational details, increment/decrement patterns, and update procedures. The documentation confirms that "SkillWillReflect update" is a process where employees update their skills and wills outside of formal reviews, but it does not provide specific operational rules for implementing adjustments like "+1 to skill_english" or "-1 for will_travel". The only operational context provided is the 1-10 rating scale and the principle of maintaining realistic ratings.

  "operational_rules": "The documentation states that SkillWillReflect is an update process where employees are encouraged to update their skills and wills outside of formal reviews. It does not specify concrete operational rules for implementing adjustments (like +1 or -1 increments). The only established rules are the 1-10 rating scale and the principle of maintaining realistic ratings."
