Step 3: Resolve the target employee for whom "+1 to skill_english" and "-1 for will_travel" should be applied, and obtain the current user context.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity endpoint to retrieve the current authenticated user details (id, name, department, location, system_roles). Since no explicit target employee is given in the task, interpret the target employee as the current authenticated user (Camilla Marchetti, id 6KR2_133) following a **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** interpretation of the instruction. Do not assume any other employee. Use exact matching on employee.id where possible, and fall back to **FUZZY** search on employee name or email if necessary (handling typos and partial matches).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_name":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"target_employee_id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_name","system_roles","department","location","target_employee_id"]}
