Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by:

1. **Called `who_am_i()` to get current authenticated user context**: Verified Camilla Marchetti (ID 6KR2_133) in Human Resources (HR) department at HQ – Italy.

2. **Resolved target employee**: Since no explicit target employee was given in the task, followed semantic/logical interpretation that the target is the current authenticated user (Camilla Marchetti, ID 6KR2_133).

3. **Verified employee existence**: Used `get_employee('6KR2_133')` to confirm the employee exists and matches the current user context.

4. **Investigated system roles**: Searched wiki documentation extensively. Found evidence in `systems/overview.md` that HRAdmin is a system role (line 29: "system roles (e.g. 'SalesUser', 'R&DUser', 'HRAdmin', 'ITAdmin')"). Confirmed current user is in HR department through both `who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`.

All facts are verified from function returns - no assumptions were made about employee details. The system_roles deduction is based on: (1) wiki documentation listing HRAdmin as a system role, and (2) current user's verified HR department membership.

No state-changing functions were called in this step.
