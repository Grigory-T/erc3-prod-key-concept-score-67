Step 7: Apply "-1 for will_travel" by updating the travel-related will level for the target employee, respecting the employee_skill level constraints.
Approach: If the travel will record was found in the retrieval step, compute the new level as current_level - 1 and perform an UpdateWillLevel action or an equivalent UPDATE on the employee_skill row with skill_type = 'will'. Respect the database constraint that level must be BETWEEN 1 AND 5; if the new level falls outside this range, the underlying execution must handle the resulting constraint error. If the travel will record was not found, record that the update could not be applied and do not create or delete any will entries, following the task literally.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"attempted":{"type":"boolean"},"success":{"type":"boolean"},"travel_will_id":{"type":["integer","null"]},"old_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"new_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["attempted","success","travel_will_id","old_level","new_level","error_message"]}
