Step 7 completed successfully. I applied "-1 for will_travel" by updating the travel-related will level for the target employee Camilla Marchetti (ID: 6KR2_133). The will_travel was found in her wills list with an initial level of 6. I calculated the new level as 6 - 1 = 5, which is within the 1-5 constraint range. Using the `update_employee_info` function, I updated the employee's profile with the new will_travel level while preserving all other employee data (skills, location, department, salary, notes, and other wills). The update was successful and verified by retrieving the updated employee record, which confirmed the will_travel level is now 5.
