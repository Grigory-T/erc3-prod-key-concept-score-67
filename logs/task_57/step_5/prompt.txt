Step 5: Retrieve the current "skill_english" skill and "will_travel" will records for the target employee from the technical implementation (employee_skill table).
Approach: Query the identified skills and wills storage (employee_skill table) for rows where employee_id equals target_employee_id and (skill_name, skill_type) matches the intended entries: one for the English skill (skill_type = 'skill') and one for the willingness to travel (skill_type = 'will'). Use exact matches first (e.g., skill_name in {'english','English','skill_english'}), and if no rows are found, relax the search using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on skill_name (handling typos, case differences, and variants like 'Engl.', 'Travel', 'Willingness to travel') and on skill_type. Allow for retrieving both records with a single SELECT query that returns up to two rows. Do not alter data in this step; only read and identify current levels if records exist.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"english_skill_found":{"type":"boolean"},"english_skill_id":{"type":["integer","null"]},"english_current_level":{"type":["integer","null"]},"travel_will_found":{"type":"boolean"},"travel_will_id":{"type":["integer","null"]},"travel_current_level":{"type":["integer","null"]}},"required":["english_skill_found","english_skill_id","english_current_level","travel_will_found","travel_will_id","travel_current_level"]}
