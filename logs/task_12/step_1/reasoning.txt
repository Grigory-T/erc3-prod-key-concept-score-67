We are in Step 1: Search internal wiki or company documentation for an explicit company-defined meaning of "busiest employee".

We need to use the wiki search functions, specifically search_wiki_fuzzy, to look for terms and variants.

Approach:
1. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of words that are relevant to the concept of "busiest employee", including possible abbreviations and variants.
2. We'll search for: 
   - "busiest employee"
   - "employee workload"
   - "utilization"
   - "capacity planning"
   - "workload metric"
   - "Vienna office workload"
   - "busy"
   - "overloaded"
   - "most utilized"
3. Also consider that the definition might be in a document that doesn't exactly match these words but is related. We'll use the fuzzy search to account for typos and partial matches.

Note: search_wiki_fuzzy returns a list of matches with context. We'll have to interpret the results and see if any of them contain a definition.

Steps in code:
- Define the list of target words.
- Call search_wiki_fuzzy with these words (top_n=10, context_chars=100) to get a list of matches.
- Examine the matches for any that seem to define a metric or guideline for "busiest employee".
- If multiple documents, prioritize those that explicitly define the term.

We are looking for:
- definition_found: boolean, whether we found any definition.
- definition_text: the text that defines the term (if found).
- metric_type: if a metric is defined (e.g., "total logged hours", "utilization percentage", etc.).
- lookback_period_days: if a time window is specified (e.g., last 30 days).
- metric_defined: boolean, whether a metric is defined (even if not complete, but at least a metric type is mentioned).

We'll then output a JSON object with these fields.

Let's write the code accordingly.

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 19:36:02

We have found a definition in the wiki that explains how employee workload is measured.
 The definition text starts with: "is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**."
 This is from the project_registry.md file, and it explains the metric of workload as the sum of allocated FTE slices (time slices) across active projects.

 However, note that the definition text we extracted is truncated. Let's load the full document to get more context and see if there's a lookback period.

 Also, note that the metric type we initially set as "number of projects" is not accurate. The text says "allocated FTE slices", so the metric is the sum of time slices (FTE allocation).

 Let's load the project_registry.md file to get the full definition and check for any time window.

We are verifying the execution of Step 1.

We executed a fuzzy search on the wiki with a list of relevant terms and found multiple matches. The most relevant match was in `systems/project_registry.md` at line 64, which provides a clear definition of how employee workload is measured.

The definition text we extracted is from the context of the match. However, note that the printed context in the output was incomplete (it started with "is determined by analysing ..."). Let's look back at the printed output:

From the output:
```
--- Match in systems/project_registry.md, line 64 ---
Matched word: employee workload
Context: regulatory updates.
- **Internal process / IT projects**
  - Improvements in production, logistics, quality, HR, IT and digitalisation.

## Workload

Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team de
```

We see that the context printed includes the line above the match and then the match. The actual definition sentence is: "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**."

But note: the context printed is truncated (ends with "Each project stores, as part of its team de"). However, we can see that the definition is present and we have the key sentence.

We also have another match in the same file at line 87 that discusses "overloaded" and mentions "aggregate planned workload", and at line 102 that mentions the chatbot can answer "Who is overloaded?" by aggregating `TimeSlice` values.

Therefore, we have a clear definition and a metric (sum of TimeSlice). However, we did not find any explicit time window (lookback period) in these snippets. We should check if there is any mention of a time window for measuring workload.

Let's load the entire project_registry.md file to see if there is more context about time windows or lookback periods.

We can use `load_wiki` to read the entire file and then search for terms like "days", "weeks", "months", "last", "rolling", etc.

But note: the instruction says to use fuzzy search. However, we are allowed to load specific wiki pages if needed. We already found the definition in a specific file. Let's load that file to get the full context.

We'll do this now.

We have executed the step instruction to search the wiki for a definition of "busiest employee" and found a clear definition in the project registry.
 The definition states that employee workload is determined by analysing allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects.
 We have also checked for a time window (lookback period) and found none in the definition.
 The metric type is clearly the sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects.

 We have not found any explicit time window (like last 30 days) in the definition, so lookback_period_days remains null.

 Let's confirm that the output matches what we found and is derived from the function returns.

 The JSON output must contain:
   definition_found: true (because we found a definition)
   definition_text: the text we extracted (from the workload section)
   metric_type: "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects" (as derived from the definition)
   lookback_period_days: null (no time window mentioned)
   metric_defined: true (because the definition includes a metric)

 We used the search_wiki_fuzzy function and then loaded the specific file to verify.

 Therefore, we can provide the following JSON.
