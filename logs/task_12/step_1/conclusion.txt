I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki using fuzzy search for terms related to "busiest employee" and workload metrics. The search returned 225 matches, and the most relevant result was found in `systems/project_registry.md`. I verified this by loading the specific wiki page and extracting the exact definition text.

The company explicitly defines employee workload as being determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across all active projects. This is the standard metric used at Bellini Coatings for measuring how busy an employee is. No specific time window (lookback period) is mentioned in the definition.

All facts in the JSON response are derived directly from function returns and printed outputs - no made-up data or assumptions were used.
