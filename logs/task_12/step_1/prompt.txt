Step 1: Search internal wiki or company documentation for an explicit company-defined meaning of "busiest employee" and any standard metric, formula, report, or guideline used to measure how busy an employee is (for example, utilization, workload, total hours, number of projects).
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) to perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms and their possible abbreviations or variants, including but not limited to "busiest employee", "employee workload", "utilization", "capacity planning", "workload metric", and "Vienna office workload". Account for typos, partial matches, and alternate wording (for example, "busy", "overloaded", "most utilized"). If multiple documents are found, prioritize any that explicitly define how "busiest" is measured at company level. Extract whether there is a clear definition, the description text, the metric type (for example, "total logged hours", "utilization percentage", "sum of time_slice"), and any defined time window (for example, last 30 days).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"metric_type":{"type":["string","null"]},"lookback_period_days":{"type":["integer","null"]},"metric_defined":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["definition_found","metric_defined"]}
