DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:37:34
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed exactly according to the plan, delivering a concrete company-defined metric for 'busiest employee' as the sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across all active projects. There are no discrepancies or problems—this is the result expected by the plan. No information has been found that would require replanning, aborting, or ending the task at this point, so the next logical step is to proceed with Step 2: searching for any existing technical implementation of workload reporting.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:44:44
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1 and 2 have produced expected and relevant results according to the original plan: a clear company-defined metric for 'busiest employee' (sum of allocated FTE TimeSlice across active projects) has been found in documentation, and a thorough search confirms that no existing calculator/report/dashboard implements this metric, so a direct query of core tables as per the plan is appropriate. There are no blockers or inconsistencies. The plan remains valid and should proceed to Step 3 as designed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:50:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced results that exactly match what was expected in the original plan. Step 3 confirms that the user has all necessary permissions, and the data sources are clear and accessible. There are no discrepancies or missing capabilities. The next step will query for employee data and calculate the busyness metrics as required by the plan. There is no indication that replanning is needed, and no blockages have been encountered. Therefore, the plan remains valid and execution should continue as originally specified.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:56:39
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed as described, with no inconsistencies or missing data. The required company metric for 'busiest employee' in Vienna was strictly applied, and all relevant data was sourced and calculated per plan. The outcome is clear: Jonas Schneider is the busiest employee in Vienna, with a busyness score (sum of FTE slices across active projects) of 0.50. No further steps or replanning are needed.
