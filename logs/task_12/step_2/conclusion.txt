I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by performing comprehensive searches across internal documentation as instructed. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: I conducted a fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of 15 terms including "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar variants. This returned 300 matches, but none corresponded to named technical implementations for calculating employee workload or busyness.

2. **Regex Pattern Matching**: I performed regex searches with patterns like `r"report.*workload"` and `r"dashboard.*utilization"` using `search_wiki`, which found 0 matches, indicating no explicit report or dashboard names in the wiki.

3. **Wiki File Examination**: I listed all wiki files with `list_wiki()` (19 files) and examined each, particularly focusing on `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`. While this file mentions "Reporting and summaries", it does not name any specific reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs. Other systems files were checked and yielded no relevant implementations.

4. **Location-Specific Search**: I searched for Vienna-related documentation by filtering wiki files for 'vienna' in the name (none found) and searching for "Vienna" in content. No Vienna-specific workload reports or implementations were discovered.

5. **Technical Implementation Search**: I searched for terms like "BI tool", "SQL view", "API endpoint", etc., using both regex and fuzzy searches. Only a generic mention of "BI tools" was found in an employee profile, not a specific implementation.

6. **API Function Review**: I reviewed available API functions (e.g., `time_summary_by_employee`, `get_project`) but these are general-purpose and not pre-built workload calculations with location filtering. No dedicated function for aggregated FTE workload (as defined in Step 1) exists.

All facts are derived directly from function returns: `search_wiki_fuzzy` results were printed, `load_wiki` content was analyzed, `list_wiki` files were inspected, and `search_wiki` regex searches were performed. No data was invented or assumed.

Since no existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness—especially with location filtering for Vienna—were found, `implementation_found` is false and the `implementations` array is empty.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "implementations": []
}
