Step 2: Search for any existing technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that already calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna, to reuse instead of implementing logic from scratch.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar. Account for typos, partial names, and abbreviations. Include fuzzy matching and partial string search across object names, descriptions, and identifiers. If found, list all relevant implementations with their names, locations (for example, BI tool, internal web application, SQL view), input parameters, and whether they support filtering by location. If nothing relevant or only unrelated items are found, mark implementation_found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"implementations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"type":{"type":"string"},"supports_location_filter":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["name","type","supports_location_filter"]}}},"required":["implementation_found","implementations"]}
