We are executing Step 2: Search for any existing technical implementation that calculates employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna.

 Approach:
 1. We have access to a wiki search function (search_wiki_fuzzy) and also can look for reports or dashboards in the wiki.
 2. We are to look for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", etc.
 3. We'll perform a fuzzy search on the wiki and also look at other sources? However, the available functions only include wiki search (search_wiki_fuzzy, search_wiki by regex) and list_wiki to see all files.
 4. We are to return a list of implementations found, with name, type, and whether they support location filter.

 Steps in code:
 a. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of search terms to find relevant documents.
 b. Also, we can list all wiki files and manually inspect (by loading) any that seem relevant (e.g., containing words like 'report', 'dashboard', 'utilization', 'workload').
 c. However, note that the step says "technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs)". The wiki might document these, but we don't have direct access to system catalogs or BI tools. We are limited to the wiki and the provided functions.

 Given the constraints, we will rely on the wiki search to find any documentation about such implementations.

 We'll define a list of search terms and use search_wiki_fuzzy for each term? Actually, search_wiki_fuzzy takes a list of words and returns matches for each word. We can use a list of words and then aggregate the results.

 Alternatively, we can use the regex search (search_wiki) to look for patterns, but note that search_wiki uses a regex string and returns exact line matches.

 Let's try both:

 Plan:
 1. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of words: ["workload", "utilization", "capacity", "report", "dashboard", "Vienna", "busy", "employee", "FTE", "TimeSlice"]
 2. We'll set a high top_n (say 20) to get many results.
 3. We'll then examine the returned matches and see if they point to any documented reports or dashboards.

 However, note that the step expects to find technical implementations. We are only allowed to use the provided functions, so we can only return what we find in the wiki.

 We'll also list all wiki files and look at the file names for any that sound like reports (e.g., "reports.md", "dashboards.md").

 Implementation:

 Step 1: Get all wiki files (list_wiki) and look at their names.
 Step 2: Use search_wiki_fuzzy with the list of words.
 Step 3: Also, we can do a regex search for the word "report" or "dashboard" in the wiki.

 Let's code accordingly.

 But note: The step says to look for "any existing technical implementation". We are limited to the wiki, so we might not find any. In that case, we set implementation_found to false.

 We'll do:

 1. list_wiki() to get all files.
 2. For each file, load_wiki and check if it contains any of the keywords (maybe by using regex search on the content? But we have search_wiki for that). We can use search_wiki with a regex pattern for each keyword.

 However, to avoid too many calls, we can use the fuzzy search and then load only the top matching files.

 We'll do:

 - Use search_wiki_fuzzy with words: ["workload", "utilization", "capacity", "report", "dashboard", "Vienna", "busy", "employee", "FTE", "TimeSlice"]
 - We'll get a list of matches, each with a path and context.

 Then, we'll load the unique files from the top matches and examine them for any mention of a report or dashboard.

 But note: The step says "list all relevant implementations". We are to extract the name, type (e.g., "SQL view", "BI dashboard"), and whether it supports location filter.

 We'll have to parse the wiki content for these details.

 Since we don't have a structured way, we'll look for patterns in the text.

 Let's start by getting the fuzzy search results and then examine the top files.

 We'll set top_n to 30 for each word? Actually, search_wiki_fuzzy returns top_n matches for each word. We'll set top_n=10 for each word, but note that the function returns for each word, so we'll get 10 matches per word.

 We'll then aggregate by file path and look at the highest ratio matches.

 Alternatively, we can use the regex search to look for the exact string "report" or "dashboard" in the entire wiki.

 Let's do:

 Step 1: Use search_wiki_fuzzy with the list of words and top_n=10.
 Step 2: Also, use search_wiki with a regex pattern that matches "report" or "dashboard" or "utilization" (case-insensitive).

 We'll combine the results.

 We are looking for any documentation that describes a report, dashboard, view, or job that calculates employee workload.

 We'll then manually (via code) inspect the content of the top matching files.

 We'll write code to:

 1. Perform fuzzy search and regex search.
 2. Collect unique file paths.
 3. For each unique file, load the content and look for any section that describes a report or dashboard.

 However, note that the step expects a list of implementations. We are to return an array of objects.

 We'll try to extract:

 - name: the name of the report/dashboard (e.g., from a heading or a bullet point)
 - type: we can try to infer from the context (e.g., "SQL view", "Power BI dashboard", "API endpoint")
 - supports_location_filter: true if the documentation mentions filtering by location or specifically Vienna.

 We are not expected to be perfect, but we should do our best to extract this information.

 Since this is a text-based search, we might not find any. We'll set implementation_found to false if we don't find any relevant documentation.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll start by doing the fuzzy search and regex search.

 We'll use:

   fuzzy_results = search_wiki_fuzzy(words, top_n=10, context_chars=200)

 We'll then get the unique file paths from the fuzzy_results.

 We'll also do a regex search for the pattern: r"report|dashboard|utilization|workload|capacity" (case-insensitive) to get more lines.

 Then, we'll load the content of each unique file and look for any section that seems to describe a report or dashboard.

 We'll look for lines that contain the words "report", "dashboard", "view", "endpoint", "job".

 We'll then try to extract a name (maybe the line before or after, or the heading).

 But note: The wiki content is Markdown. We can look for headings (starting with #) and then the next lines.

 We'll do a simple text analysis.

 However, given the complexity and the fact that we are in a simulated environment, we might not get perfect results.

 We'll do:

   For each file:
      content = load_wiki(file_path)
      Split content into lines.
      Look for lines that contain any of the keywords: ["report", "dashboard", "view", "endpoint", "job", "utilization", "workload", "capacity"]
      For each such line, we'll try to capture the heading above it (the last line that starts with #) as the name of the section.

   We'll then try to infer the type by the keywords in the line (e.g., if it says "SQL view", then type="SQL view").

   We'll also check if the line or the surrounding lines mention "location" or "Vienna" to determine if it supports location filter.

 We'll collect these and then return.

 Since we are in a simulation, we might not find any. We'll set implementation_found to false if we don't find any.

 Let's code accordingly.

We need to search for existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna.

We can search the wiki for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", etc. We can use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of relevant words.

Also, we can look at the functions available to us: there are `time_summary_by_project` and `time_summary_by_employee` functions that provide summaries of time entries. However, these are for logged hours, not for planned FTE slices. The definition from Step 1 says workload is based on allocated FTE slices in the project registry.

We need to search for any documentation about such reports or dashboards. Let's do a fuzzy search on the wiki for relevant terms.

We'll use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of words:

- workload
- utilization
- capacity
- report
- dashboard
- Vienna
- busy
- employee
- FTE
- time tracking
- summary

We'll set a reasonable top_n and context_chars to get meaningful results. Then, we'll analyze the results to see if any existing implementations are mentioned.

We'll also check the wiki for any pages that might list reports or dashboards (like a BI or reporting page).

Let's start with the fuzzy search.

[REASONING #7] 2025-12-09 19:42:49
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found one relevant file: `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`. Let's load it and examine it for any existing implementations.
 We'll also check a few more files that might be relevant, like `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md` and `offices/Vienna.md` (if exists).
 We already saw that `systems/project_registry.md` has content about workload but it's more about definition.
 Let's focus on finding actual implementations (reports, dashboards, etc.).

[REASONING #8] 2025-12-09 19:43:23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to determine if there are any existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna.

Based on the searches performed:
1. We searched the wiki using fuzzy search and regex for terms related to reports, dashboards, workload, etc.
2. We examined the `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md` file and found a section on "Reporting and summaries" that mentions the system can aggregate time in different ways (by project, customer, employee, etc.), but no specific named reports or dashboards are mentioned.
3. We checked for Vienna-specific documentation and found none.
4. We searched for BI tools, SQL views, etc., and found only a passing reference to "BI tools" in an employee profile, not an actual implementation.
5. We found that the available functions (`time_summary_by_employee`, `get_project`, `search_projects`) can be used to compute workload, but these are general API functions, not pre-built reports or dashboards.

Therefore, we have not found any existing technical implementation (report, dashboard, SQL view, API endpoint, or automated job) that specifically calculates employee workload or busyness, especially with location filtering.

However, note that the `time_summary_by_employee` function can be used to get time summaries for employees, and we can filter by location by first getting employees from a location and then passing their IDs. But this is not a pre-built report/dashboard.

Thus, we must set `implementation_found` to `false` and return an empty array for `implementations`.

Let's create the JSON output accordingly.

We have completed Step 2. The search did not find any existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness with location filtering for Vienna. The output must be a JSON object with the structure specified.

 Based on the findings, we set:
   implementation_found: False
   implementations: [] (empty array)

 We must output in the required JSON format.

[REASONING #10] 2025-12-09 19:44:41
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
First, the user is asking for verification before accepting my conclusion. I need to confirm that I executed the step instruction correctly and didn't skip any actions or assume anything.

Step 2's instruction: Search for any existing technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that already calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna.

Approach specified: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar. Account for typos, partial names, and abbreviations. Include fuzzy matching and partial string search across object names, descriptions, and identifiers.

Expected Output: JSON with implementation_found (boolean) and implementations (array of objects with name, type, supports_location_filter).

In my previous execution, I did:
- Fuzzy search on wiki with search_terms list including the specified terms.
- Regex search for patterns.
- Listed wiki files and checked relevant ones.
- Searched for Vienna-specific files.
- Checked for technical terms like BI tools.
- Examined available API functions.

I verified facts from function returns:
- search_wiki_fuzzy returned matches, but none were specific implementations.
- load_wiki on systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md showed content but no named implementations.
- list_wiki showed all files, and I checked each.
- search_wiki for regex and specific terms yielded minimal results.
- search_employees for Vienna location returned 0 employees, which might indicate no Vienna employees or a location naming issue, but that's not directly about implementations.

Key point: Did I find any existing technical implementations? From my search, no named reports, dashboards, etc., were found. The output I provided has implementation_found: false and an empty array.

Checklist:
- Did I execute the step instruction? Yes, I performed fuzzy and semantic searches.
- Is there any action I skipped or assumed? I assumed that the wiki and available functions are the primary sources for technical implementations. The step says "across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages." I used wiki and API functions; system catalogs might refer to other systems, but based on available functions, I think I covered what's accessible.
- Are all facts verified? I used function returns directly: printed results from search_wiki_fuzzy, load_wiki, etc. I didn't make up data.

Potential issue: When I searched for Vienna employees with search_employees(location="Vienna"), it returned 0. This might mean the location string is different, but that's for employee search, not for implementation search. For implementations, I should have searched for "Vienna" in wiki content more thoroughly.

In my code, I checked for Vienna files and found none. I also searched for "Vienna" in the fuzzy search, but it wasn't in the initial search_terms. Let me recall: my search_terms included "Vienna workload", but in the fuzzy search, it might not have matched well.

In the fuzzy search results, I didn't see any direct hits for Vienna-related implementations. The regex search found 0 matches.

I also checked for "Vienna" in wiki files by listing files with 'vienna' in the name, and found none.

But perhaps I should have done a more thorough semantic search for location filtering in general, not just Vienna.

Another thing: The step asks for "especially by location such as Vienna", so I need to ensure I searched for location filtering capabilities.

In my implementation_details, when I examined files, I checked for supports_location_filter by looking for 'location' or 'Vienna' in content.

Since no implementations were found, the output is correct.

But let me double-check if there are any other sources I missed. The available functions include time_summary_by_employee which can filter by employees, and if employees have locations, we could filter by location programmatically, but that's not a pre-existing report or dashboard; it's an API function. The step is looking for existing implementations, not potential ways to build them.

The step says "to reuse instead of implementing logic from scratch." So if there's an API endpoint that provides workload data, it should be considered.

I mentioned available functions, but they are general-purpose. For example, time_summary_by_employee provides hours by employee, which could be used for busyness based on logged hours, but from Step 1, workload is defined as FTE slices, not time entries. So time_summary_by_employee might not be the correct metric.

But still, it's an existing function that calculates something related. However, it's not a named report or dashboard; it's an API function.

The expected output requires implementations with name and type. For API functions, if they are documented as endpoints, they could be listed. But in my search, I didn't find documentation naming specific API endpoints for workload calculations.

I searched for "API endpoint" in the wiki and found no matches in the content I checked.

In my code, I searched for tech terms including "API endpoint", and only found a mention of "BI tools" in employee profiles.

So, I think my conclusion is valid.

To be thorough, let me consider if I should have searched for more terms or in different ways.

The user provided a verification step, so I should confirm.

In my final answer, I summarized the findings, and the JSON output is based on what I found.

I should ensure that all searches were as per the approach.

One thing: I didn't explicitly search for "employee utilization dashboard" in a fuzzy way? I included it in search_terms: "employee utilization" was in the list, and "utilization dashboard" was not explicitly, but "employee utilization" should cover it.

In search_terms, I had: "employee utilization", "utilization dashboard", etc.

Yes, in the code, search_terms included "employee utilization", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", etc.

So, I think I covered it.

Now, for the JSON response: it must contain only values explicitly printed/verified. I printed the output dictionary, and it shows implementation_found: false and implementations: [].

I didn't change any state; I only performed read operations.

Therefore, I can repeat my final answer and JSON blocks.

But the user says: "If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks."

I am sure, so I'll provide them.

Final answer should include the conclusion, and JSON as before.

So, I'll write:
