STEP 4 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 19:56:33

I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each requirement:

1. **Vienna Employee Identification**: I searched for employees with location matching 'Vienna' using exact and fuzzy matching. Found 4 employees in "Vienna Office – Austria" location.

2. **Company-Defined Metric Used**: From Step 1, the metric was defined as "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects". I used exactly this metric.

3. **Workload Computation**: For each Vienna employee, I computed:
   - Total FTE allocation (TimeSlice sum) across all active projects = busyness_score
   - Number of active projects (from FTE allocations)
   - Total logged hours (last 30 days as reasonable period)
   - Projects from time entries

4. **Data Sources**: Used only non-sensitive columns (id, name) from employees. All data came from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` for all employees
   - `search_projects(status=['active'])` for active projects
   - `get_project()` for team allocations
   - `search_time_entries()` for time data

5. **No State Changes**: I only read data - no update functions were called.

6. **All Facts Verified**: Every value in the JSON output was printed from function returns:
   - 4 Vienna employees with names and IDs
   - Jonas Schneider: 0.50 FTE from 2 active projects
   - Other employees: 0.00 FTE, 0 projects
   - All have 0 hours logged in last 30 days (printed totals were 0.00)

The results show Jonas Schneider is the busiest employee in Vienna with a busyness score of 0.50 FTE, allocated to 2 active projects.
