## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-03
Current actor: Authenticated user 6KR2_139
User details: {"id": "6KR2_139", "name": "Giorgia Ricci", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Which employee in Vienna is busiest

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki or company documentation for an explicit company-defined meaning of "busiest employee" and any standard metric, formula, report, or guideline used to measure how busy an employee is (for example, utilization, workload, total hours, number of projects).
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) to perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms and their possible abbreviations or variants, including but not limited to "busiest employee", "employee workload", "utilization", "capacity planning", "workload metric", and "Vienna office workload". Account for typos, partial matches, and alternate wording (for example, "busy", "overloaded", "most utilized"). If multiple documents are found, prioritize any that explicitly define how "busiest" is measured at company level. Extract whether there is a clear definition, the description text, the metric type (for example, "total logged hours", "utilization percentage", "sum of time_slice"), and any defined time window (for example, last 30 days).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"metric_type":{"type":["string","null"]},"lookback_period_days":{"type":["integer","null"]},"metric_defined":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["definition_found","metric_defined"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki using fuzzy search for terms related to "busiest employee" and workload metrics. The search returned 225 matches, and the most relevant result was found in `systems/project_registry.md`. I verified this by loading the specific wiki page and extracting the exact definition text.

The company explicitly defines employee workload as being determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across all active projects. This is the standard metric used at Bellini Coatings for measuring how busy an employee is. No specific time window (lookback period) is mentioned in the definition.

All facts in the JSON response are derived directly from function returns and printed outputs - no made-up data or assumptions were used.

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "definition_text": "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:\n* `Employee` – the employee ID\n* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)\nThese allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.",
  "metric_type": "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects",
  "lookback_period_days": null,
  "metric_defined": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search for any existing technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that already calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna, to reuse instead of implementing logic from scratch.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar. Account for typos, partial names, and abbreviations. Include fuzzy matching and partial string search across object names, descriptions, and identifiers. If found, list all relevant implementations with their names, locations (for example, BI tool, internal web application, SQL view), input parameters, and whether they support filtering by location. If nothing relevant or only unrelated items are found, mark implementation_found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"implementations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"type":{"type":"string"},"supports_location_filter":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["name","type","supports_location_filter"]}}},"required":["implementation_found","implementations"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by performing comprehensive searches across internal documentation as instructed. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: I conducted a fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of 15 terms including "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar variants. This returned 300 matches, but none corresponded to named technical implementations for calculating employee workload or busyness.

2. **Regex Pattern Matching**: I performed regex searches with patterns like `r"report.*workload"` and `r"dashboard.*utilization"` using `search_wiki`, which found 0 matches, indicating no explicit report or dashboard names in the wiki.

3. **Wiki File Examination**: I listed all wiki files with `list_wiki()` (19 files) and examined each, particularly focusing on `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`. While this file mentions "Reporting and summaries", it does not name any specific reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs. Other systems files were checked and yielded no relevant implementations.

4. **Location-Specific Search**: I searched for Vienna-related documentation by filtering wiki files for 'vienna' in the name (none found) and searching for "Vienna" in content. No Vienna-specific workload reports or implementations were discovered.

5. **Technical Implementation Search**: I searched for terms like "BI tool", "SQL view", "API endpoint", etc., using both regex and fuzzy searches. Only a generic mention of "BI tools" was found in an employee profile, not a specific implementation.

6. **API Function Review**: I reviewed available API functions (e.g., `time_summary_by_employee`, `get_project`) but these are general-purpose and not pre-built workload calculations with location filtering. No dedicated function for aggregated FTE workload (as defined in Step 1) exists.

All facts are derived directly from function returns: `search_wiki_fuzzy` results were printed, `load_wiki` content was analyzed, `list_wiki` files were inspected, and `search_wiki` regex searches were performed. No data was invented or assumed.

Since no existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness—especially with location filtering for Vienna—were found, `implementation_found` is false and the `implementations` array is empty.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "implementations": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine which data sources will be used to assess how busy employees in Vienna are and check that the current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance and Administration, HQ – Italy) has permission to read the necessary non-sensitive data.
Approach: Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, decide whether to use an existing implementation (for example, a workload report) or to directly query core SQL tables such as employee, team_member, and time_entry. Ensure that only allowed, non-sensitive fields are planned for use: from employee, use id, name, email, location, and department but explicitly avoid salary and notes; from time_entry, use employee_id, project_id, customer_id, entry_date, hours, status; from team_member, use project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice. Then call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity and roles, and check against company policies that a Finance and Administration user can read these non-sensitive fields for analysis purposes. Do not proceed to computation if policy denies access.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_proceed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason_if_denied":{"type":["string","null"]},"data_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_proceed","data_sources"]}
**Result:** The current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance & Administration) can proceed with accessing the necessary non-sensitive data. I have verified through function calls that the user is authenticated and can access employee, project, and time entry data (though time entry search returned no results, this is likely due to no entries existing rather than an access issue). According to company rules, the user is allowed to read non-sensitive employee fields (name, email, location, department) via chatbot access. There are no explicit restrictions preventing Finance & Administration from reading non-sensitive project and time entry data for analysis purposes.

Based on the metric defined in Step 1 (sum of allocated FTE slices across active projects), the primary data sources needed are EmployeeRegistry (for employee location) and ProjectRegistry (for team allocations with TimeSlice). The step instructions also mention time_entry as a possible source, so I include TimeTracking as a data source for completeness, though it may not be necessary for the defined metric.

We will strictly avoid sensitive fields such as salary, HR notes, and private identifiers.

{
  "can_proceed": true,
  "reason_if_denied": null,
  "data_sources": ["EmployeeRegistry", "ProjectRegistry", "TimeTracking"]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 4: Query core tables to build workload or busyness metrics for all employees located in Vienna, according to the company definition from step 1 or, if none exists, using total logged work hours as the proxy metric.
Approach: Using SQL, first select all employees whose location corresponds to Vienna by filtering employee.location with an exact match on 'Vienna' where possible and, if needed, FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching against the location table to handle possible variants or typos (for example, 'Wien', 'Vienna Office – Austria'). Use only non-sensitive columns (id, name, email, location, department). For these Vienna employees, compute workload metrics depending on the metric_type and lookback_period_days from step 1: for example, if the metric is total logged hours in a given period, join time_entry on employee_id and sum hours grouped by employee within the defined time window; if the metric involves utilization or time_slice, join team_member and aggregate time_slice across active projects. If no explicit metric is defined in step 1, compute at least: (a) total logged hours per employee over a reasonable standard period such as the last 30 days, and (b) number of distinct projects from time_entry or team_member, documenting that these are used as a proxy for busyness. Ensure searches for employee ids and project ids account for potential typos or inconsistent naming via fuzzy matching only when exact joins fail. Produce a per-employee record containing identifiers and computed metrics, and a derived busyness_score (for example, equal to total_hours if no more complex formula is defined).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_filtered":{"type":"string"},"metric_used":{"type":"string"},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"num_projects":{"type":"integer"},"busyness_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","busyness_score"]}}},"required":["location_filtered","metric_used","employees"]}

Based on the execution results, I have successfully completed Step 4 by querying core tables to build workload metrics for all employees located in Vienna according to the company definition from Step 1.

## Summary of Execution:

1. **Identified Vienna Employees**: Found 4 employees located in Vienna Office – Austria:
   - Tim Hoffmann (6KR2_032)
   - Jonas Schneider (6KR2_033) 
   - Kim Bender (6KR2_034)
   - Matthias Schuster (6KR2_035)

2. **Applied Company-Defined Metric**: Used the metric from Step 1: "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects"

3. **Computed Workload Metrics**: 
   - Examined 15 active projects and their team allocations
   - Calculated FTE allocations for each Vienna employee
   - Also computed total logged hours for the last 30 days (January 4 - February 3, 2025) as additional reference
   - Used FTE sum as the busyness_score per company definition

4. **Results**: 
   - Jonas Schneider has the highest busyness score of 0.50 FTE (allocated to 2 active projects)
   - The other three employees have 0.00 FTE allocation (not currently assigned to any active projects)
   - All employees have 0 total hours logged in the last 30 days

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 4: Query core tables to build workload or busyness metrics for all employees located in Vienna, according to the company definition from step 1 or, if none exists, using total logged work hours as the proxy metric.
Approach: Using SQL, first select all employees whose location corresponds to Vienna by filtering employee.location with an exact match on 'Vienna' where possible and, if needed, FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching against the location table to handle possible variants or typos (for example, 'Wien', 'Vienna Office – Austria'). Use only non-sensitive columns (id, name, email, location, department). For these Vienna employees, compute workload metrics depending on the metric_type and lookback_period_days from step 1: for example, if the metric is total logged hours in a given period, join time_entry on employee_id and sum hours grouped by employee within the defined time window; if the metric involves utilization or time_slice, join team_member and aggregate time_slice across active projects. If no explicit metric is defined in step 1, compute at least: (a) total logged hours per employee over a reasonable standard period such as the last 30 days, and (b) number of distinct projects from time_entry or team_member, documenting that these are used as a proxy for busyness. Ensure searches for employee ids and project ids account for potential typos or inconsistent naming via fuzzy matching only when exact joins fail. Produce a per-employee record containing identifiers and computed metrics, and a derived busyness_score (for example, equal to total_hours if no more complex formula is defined).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_filtered":{"type":"string"},"metric_used":{"type":"string"},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"num_projects":{"type":"integer"},"busyness_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","busyness_score"]}}},"required":["location_filtered","metric_used","employees"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each requirement:

1. **Vienna Employee Identification**: I searched for employees with location matching 'Vienna' using exact and fuzzy matching. Found 4 employees in "Vienna Office – Austria" location.

2. **Company-Defined Metric Used**: From Step 1, the metric was defined as "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects". I used exactly this metric.

3. **Workload Computation**: For each Vienna employee, I computed:
   - Total FTE allocation (TimeSlice sum) across all active projects = busyness_score
   - Number of active projects (from FTE allocations)
   - Total logged hours (last 30 days as reasonable period)
   - Projects from time entries

4. **Data Sources**: Used only non-sensitive columns (id, name) from employees. All data came from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` for all employees
   - `search_projects(status=['active'])` for active projects
   - `get_project()` for team allocations
   - `search_time_entries()` for time data

5. **No State Changes**: I only read data - no update functions were called.

6. **All Facts Verified**: Every value in the JSON output was printed from function returns:
   - 4 Vienna employees with names and IDs
   - Jonas Schneider: 0.50 FTE from 2 active projects
   - Other employees: 0.00 FTE, 0 projects
   - All have 0 hours logged in last 30 days (printed totals were 0.00)

The results show Jonas Schneider is the busiest employee in Vienna with a busyness score of 0.50 FTE, allocated to 2 active projects.
