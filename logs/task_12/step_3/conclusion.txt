The current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance & Administration) can proceed with accessing the necessary non-sensitive data. I have verified through function calls that the user is authenticated and can access employee, project, and time entry data (though time entry search returned no results, this is likely due to no entries existing rather than an access issue). According to company rules, the user is allowed to read non-sensitive employee fields (name, email, location, department) via chatbot access. There are no explicit restrictions preventing Finance & Administration from reading non-sensitive project and time entry data for analysis purposes.

Based on the metric defined in Step 1 (sum of allocated FTE slices across active projects), the primary data sources needed are EmployeeRegistry (for employee location) and ProjectRegistry (for team allocations with TimeSlice). The step instructions also mention time_entry as a possible source, so I include TimeTracking as a data source for completeness, though it may not be necessary for the defined metric.

We will strictly avoid sensitive fields such as salary, HR notes, and private identifiers.
