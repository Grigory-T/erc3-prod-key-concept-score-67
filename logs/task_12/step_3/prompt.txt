Step 3: Determine which data sources will be used to assess how busy employees in Vienna are and check that the current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance and Administration, HQ – Italy) has permission to read the necessary non-sensitive data.
Approach: Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, decide whether to use an existing implementation (for example, a workload report) or to directly query core SQL tables such as employee, team_member, and time_entry. Ensure that only allowed, non-sensitive fields are planned for use: from employee, use id, name, email, location, and department but explicitly avoid salary and notes; from time_entry, use employee_id, project_id, customer_id, entry_date, hours, status; from team_member, use project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice. Then call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity and roles, and check against company policies that a Finance and Administration user can read these non-sensitive fields for analysis purposes. Do not proceed to computation if policy denies access.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_proceed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason_if_denied":{"type":["string","null"]},"data_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_proceed","data_sources"]}
