## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki or company documentation for an explicit company-defined meaning of "busiest employee" and any standard metric, formula, report, or guideline used to measure how busy an employee is (for example, utilization, workload, total hours, number of projects).
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) to perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms and their possible abbreviations or variants, including but not limited to "busiest employee", "employee workload", "utilization", "capacity planning", "workload metric", and "Vienna office workload". Account for typos, partial matches, and alternate wording (for example, "busy", "overloaded", "most utilized"). If multiple documents are found, prioritize any that explicitly define how "busiest" is measured at company level. Extract whether there is a clear definition, the description text, the metric type (for example, "total logged hours", "utilization percentage", "sum of time_slice"), and any defined time window (for example, last 30 days).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"metric_type":{"type":["string","null"]},"lookback_period_days":{"type":["integer","null"]},"metric_defined":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["definition_found","metric_defined"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki using fuzzy search for terms related to "busiest employee" and workload metrics. The search returned 225 matches, and the most relevant result was found in `systems/project_registry.md`. I verified this by loading the specific wiki page and extracting the exact definition text.

The company explicitly defines employee workload as being determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across all active projects. This is the standard metric used at Bellini Coatings for measuring how busy an employee is. No specific time window (lookback period) is mentioned in the definition.

All facts in the JSON response are derived directly from function returns and printed outputs - no made-up data or assumptions were used.

{
  "definition_found": true,
  "definition_text": "Employee workload in Bellini Coatings is determined by analysing **their allocated FTE slices across all active projects**. Each project stores, as part of its team definition, a list of `Workload` entries:\n* `Employee` – the employee ID\n* `TimeSlice` – the fraction of a full-time equivalent (FTE) that the employee is expected to contribute to that project (e.g. 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0)\n* `Role` – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)\nThese allocations are defined and maintained in the **project registry**, which is the system of record for planned workload assignments.",
  "metric_type": "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects",
  "lookback_period_days": null,
  "metric_defined": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search for any existing technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that already calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna, to reuse instead of implementing logic from scratch.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar. Account for typos, partial names, and abbreviations. Include fuzzy matching and partial string search across object names, descriptions, and identifiers. If found, list all relevant implementations with their names, locations (for example, BI tool, internal web application, SQL view), input parameters, and whether they support filtering by location. If nothing relevant or only unrelated items are found, mark implementation_found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"implementations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"type":{"type":"string"},"supports_location_filter":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["name","type","supports_location_filter"]}}},"required":["implementation_found","implementations"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by performing comprehensive searches across internal documentation as instructed. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: I conducted a fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of 15 terms including "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar variants. This returned 300 matches, but none corresponded to named technical implementations for calculating employee workload or busyness.

2. **Regex Pattern Matching**: I performed regex searches with patterns like `r"report.*workload"` and `r"dashboard.*utilization"` using `search_wiki`, which found 0 matches, indicating no explicit report or dashboard names in the wiki.

3. **Wiki File Examination**: I listed all wiki files with `list_wiki()` (19 files) and examined each, particularly focusing on `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`. While this file mentions "Reporting and summaries", it does not name any specific reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs. Other systems files were checked and yielded no relevant implementations.

4. **Location-Specific Search**: I searched for Vienna-related documentation by filtering wiki files for 'vienna' in the name (none found) and searching for "Vienna" in content. No Vienna-specific workload reports or implementations were discovered.

5. **Technical Implementation Search**: I searched for terms like "BI tool", "SQL view", "API endpoint", etc., using both regex and fuzzy searches. Only a generic mention of "BI tools" was found in an employee profile, not a specific implementation.

6. **API Function Review**: I reviewed available API functions (e.g., `time_summary_by_employee`, `get_project`) but these are general-purpose and not pre-built workload calculations with location filtering. No dedicated function for aggregated FTE workload (as defined in Step 1) exists.

All facts are derived directly from function returns: `search_wiki_fuzzy` results were printed, `load_wiki` content was analyzed, `list_wiki` files were inspected, and `search_wiki` regex searches were performed. No data was invented or assumed.

Since no existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness—especially with location filtering for Vienna—were found, `implementation_found` is false and the `implementations` array is empty.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "implementations": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine which data sources will be used to assess how busy employees in Vienna are and check that the current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance and Administration, HQ – Italy) has permission to read the necessary non-sensitive data.
Approach: Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, decide whether to use an existing implementation (for example, a workload report) or to directly query core SQL tables such as employee, team_member, and time_entry. Ensure that only allowed, non-sensitive fields are planned for use: from employee, use id, name, email, location, and department but explicitly avoid salary and notes; from time_entry, use employee_id, project_id, customer_id, entry_date, hours, status; from team_member, use project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice. Then call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity and roles, and check against company policies that a Finance and Administration user can read these non-sensitive fields for analysis purposes. Do not proceed to computation if policy denies access.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_proceed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason_if_denied":{"type":["string","null"]},"data_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_proceed","data_sources"]}
**Result:** The current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance & Administration) can proceed with accessing the necessary non-sensitive data. I have verified through function calls that the user is authenticated and can access employee, project, and time entry data (though time entry search returned no results, this is likely due to no entries existing rather than an access issue). According to company rules, the user is allowed to read non-sensitive employee fields (name, email, location, department) via chatbot access. There are no explicit restrictions preventing Finance & Administration from reading non-sensitive project and time entry data for analysis purposes.

Based on the metric defined in Step 1 (sum of allocated FTE slices across active projects), the primary data sources needed are EmployeeRegistry (for employee location) and ProjectRegistry (for team allocations with TimeSlice). The step instructions also mention time_entry as a possible source, so I include TimeTracking as a data source for completeness, though it may not be necessary for the defined metric.

We will strictly avoid sensitive fields such as salary, HR notes, and private identifiers.

{
  "can_proceed": true,
  "reason_if_denied": null,
  "data_sources": ["EmployeeRegistry", "ProjectRegistry", "TimeTracking"]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Query core tables to build workload or busyness metrics for all employees located in Vienna, according to the company definition from step 1 or, if none exists, using total logged work hours as the proxy metric.
Approach: Using SQL, first select all employees whose location corresponds to Vienna by filtering employee.location with an exact match on 'Vienna' where possible and, if needed, FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching against the location table to handle possible variants or typos (for example, 'Wien', 'Vienna Office – Austria'). Use only non-sensitive columns (id, name, email, location, department). For these Vienna employees, compute workload metrics depending on the metric_type and lookback_period_days from step 1: for example, if the metric is total logged hours in a given period, join time_entry on employee_id and sum hours grouped by employee within the defined time window; if the metric involves utilization or time_slice, join team_member and aggregate time_slice across active projects. If no explicit metric is defined in step 1, compute at least: (a) total logged hours per employee over a reasonable standard period such as the last 30 days, and (b) number of distinct projects from time_entry or team_member, documenting that these are used as a proxy for busyness. Ensure searches for employee ids and project ids account for potential typos or inconsistent naming via fuzzy matching only when exact joins fail. Produce a per-employee record containing identifiers and computed metrics, and a derived busyness_score (for example, equal to total_hours if no more complex formula is defined).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_filtered":{"type":"string"},"metric_used":{"type":"string"},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"num_projects":{"type":"integer"},"busyness_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","busyness_score"]}}},"required":["location_filtered","metric_used","employees"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each requirement:

1. **Vienna Employee Identification**: I searched for employees with location matching 'Vienna' using exact and fuzzy matching. Found 4 employees in "Vienna Office – Austria" location.

2. **Company-Defined Metric Used**: From Step 1, the metric was defined as "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects". I used exactly this metric.

3. **Workload Computation**: For each Vienna employee, I computed:
   - Total FTE allocation (TimeSlice sum) across all active projects = busyness_score
   - Number of active projects (from FTE allocations)
   - Total logged hours (last 30 days as reasonable period)
   - Projects from time entries

4. **Data Sources**: Used only non-sensitive columns (id, name) from employees. All data came from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` for all employees
   - `search_projects(status=['active'])` for active projects
   - `get_project()` for team allocations
   - `search_time_entries()` for time data

5. **No State Changes**: I only read data - no update functions were called.

6. **All Facts Verified**: Every value in the JSON output was printed from function returns:
   - 4 Vienna employees with names and IDs
   - Jonas Schneider: 0.50 FTE from 2 active projects
   - Other employees: 0.00 FTE, 0 projects
   - All have 0 hours logged in last 30 days (printed totals were 0.00)

The results show Jonas Schneider is the busiest employee in Vienna with a busyness score of 0.50 FTE, allocated to 2 active projects.

{
  "location_filtered": "Vienna",
  "metric_used": "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects",
  "employees": [
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
      "employee_name": "Jonas Schneider",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 2,
      "busyness_score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_032",
      "employee_name": "Tim Hoffmann",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_034",
      "employee_name": "Kim Bender",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_035",
      "employee_name": "Matthias Schuster",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The busiest employee in Vienna is Jonas Schneider (employee ID: 6KR2_033) with a busyness score of 0.50, which is the sum of allocated FTE (TimeSlice) across all active projects, as defined by company policy. Three other Vienna employees (Tim Hoffmann, Kim Bender, Matthias Schuster) have a busyness score of 0.0. Therefore, Jonas Schneider is unambiguously the busiest employee in Vienna according to the standard company workload metric.

## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal wiki or company documentation for an explicit company-defined meaning of "busiest employee" and any standard metric, formula, report, or guideline used to measure how busy an employee is (for example, utilization, workload, total hours, number of projects).
Approach: Use a wiki or documentation search function (for example, search_wiki_fuzzy) to perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search for terms and their possible abbreviations or variants, including but not limited to "busiest employee", "employee workload", "utilization", "capacity planning", "workload metric", and "Vienna office workload". Account for typos, partial matches, and alternate wording (for example, "busy", "overloaded", "most utilized"). If multiple documents are found, prioritize any that explicitly define how "busiest" is measured at company level. Extract whether there is a clear definition, the description text, the metric type (for example, "total logged hours", "utilization percentage", "sum of time_slice"), and any defined time window (for example, last 30 days).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"definition_found":{"type":"boolean"},"definition_text":{"type":["string","null"]},"metric_type":{"type":["string","null"]},"lookback_period_days":{"type":["integer","null"]},"metric_defined":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["definition_found","metric_defined"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 1 by searching the company wiki using fuzzy search for terms related to "busiest employee" and workload metrics. The search returned 225 matches, and the most relevant result was found in `systems/project_registry.md`. I verified this by loading the specific wiki page and extracting the exact definition text.

The company explicitly defines employee workload as being determined by analyzing allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across all active projects. This is the standard metric used at Bellini Coatings for measuring how busy an employee is. No specific time window (lookback period) is mentioned in the definition.

All facts in the JSON response are derived directly from function returns and printed outputs - no made-up data or assumptions were used.

  "lookback_period_days": null,

}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search for any existing technical implementation (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that already calculate employee workload or busyness, especially by location such as Vienna, to reuse instead of implementing logic from scratch.
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, system catalogs, and wiki pages for terms like "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar. Account for typos, partial names, and abbreviations. Include fuzzy matching and partial string search across object names, descriptions, and identifiers. If found, list all relevant implementations with their names, locations (for example, BI tool, internal web application, SQL view), input parameters, and whether they support filtering by location. If nothing relevant or only unrelated items are found, mark implementation_found as false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"implementations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"name":{"type":"string"},"type":{"type":"string"},"supports_location_filter":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["name","type","supports_location_filter"]}}},"required":["implementation_found","implementations"]}
**Result:** I have thoroughly executed Step 2 by performing comprehensive searches across internal documentation as instructed. Here's a summary of the verification:

1. **Fuzzy and Semantic Search**: I conducted a fuzzy search using `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of 15 terms including "workload report", "employee utilization dashboard", "time tracking summary", "capacity report", "Vienna workload", and similar variants. This returned 300 matches, but none corresponded to named technical implementations for calculating employee workload or busyness.

2. **Regex Pattern Matching**: I performed regex searches with patterns like `r"report.*workload"` and `r"dashboard.*utilization"` using `search_wiki`, which found 0 matches, indicating no explicit report or dashboard names in the wiki.

3. **Wiki File Examination**: I listed all wiki files with `list_wiki()` (19 files) and examined each, particularly focusing on `systems/time_tracking_and_reporting.md`. While this file mentions "Reporting and summaries", it does not name any specific reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs. Other systems files were checked and yielded no relevant implementations.

4. **Location-Specific Search**: I searched for Vienna-related documentation by filtering wiki files for 'vienna' in the name (none found) and searching for "Vienna" in content. No Vienna-specific workload reports or implementations were discovered.

5. **Technical Implementation Search**: I searched for terms like "BI tool", "SQL view", "API endpoint", etc., using both regex and fuzzy searches. Only a generic mention of "BI tools" was found in an employee profile, not a specific implementation.

6. **API Function Review**: I reviewed available API functions (e.g., `time_summary_by_employee`, `get_project`) but these are general-purpose and not pre-built workload calculations with location filtering. No dedicated function for aggregated FTE workload (as defined in Step 1) exists.

All facts are derived directly from function returns: `search_wiki_fuzzy` results were printed, `load_wiki` content was analyzed, `list_wiki` files were inspected, and `search_wiki` regex searches were performed. No data was invented or assumed.

Since no existing technical implementations (reports, dashboards, SQL views, API endpoints, or automated jobs) that calculate employee workload or busyness—especially with location filtering for Vienna—were found, `implementation_found` is false and the `implementations` array is empty.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "implementations": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine which data sources will be used to assess how busy employees in Vienna are and check that the current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance and Administration, HQ – Italy) has permission to read the necessary non-sensitive data.
Approach: Based on the results of steps 1 and 2, decide whether to use an existing implementation (for example, a workload report) or to directly query core SQL tables such as employee, team_member, and time_entry. Ensure that only allowed, non-sensitive fields are planned for use: from employee, use id, name, email, location, and department but explicitly avoid salary and notes; from time_entry, use employee_id, project_id, customer_id, entry_date, hours, status; from team_member, use project_id, employee_id, role, and time_slice. Then call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity function to confirm the current user identity and roles, and check against company policies that a Finance and Administration user can read these non-sensitive fields for analysis purposes. Do not proceed to computation if policy denies access.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_proceed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason_if_denied":{"type":["string","null"]},"data_sources":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_proceed","data_sources"]}
**Result:** The current user (Giorgia Ricci, Finance & Administration) can proceed with accessing the necessary non-sensitive data. I have verified through function calls that the user is authenticated and can access employee, project, and time entry data (though time entry search returned no results, this is likely due to no entries existing rather than an access issue). According to company rules, the user is allowed to read non-sensitive employee fields (name, email, location, department) via chatbot access. There are no explicit restrictions preventing Finance & Administration from reading non-sensitive project and time entry data for analysis purposes.

Based on the metric defined in Step 1 (sum of allocated FTE slices across active projects), the primary data sources needed are EmployeeRegistry (for employee location) and ProjectRegistry (for team allocations with TimeSlice). The step instructions also mention time_entry as a possible source, so I include TimeTracking as a data source for completeness, though it may not be necessary for the defined metric.

We will strictly avoid sensitive fields such as salary, HR notes, and private identifiers.

{
  "can_proceed": true,
  "reason_if_denied": null,
  "data_sources": ["EmployeeRegistry", "ProjectRegistry", "TimeTracking"]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Query core tables to build workload or busyness metrics for all employees located in Vienna, according to the company definition from step 1 or, if none exists, using total logged work hours as the proxy metric.
Approach: Using SQL, first select all employees whose location corresponds to Vienna by filtering employee.location with an exact match on 'Vienna' where possible and, if needed, FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching against the location table to handle possible variants or typos (for example, 'Wien', 'Vienna Office – Austria'). Use only non-sensitive columns (id, name, email, location, department). For these Vienna employees, compute workload metrics depending on the metric_type and lookback_period_days from step 1: for example, if the metric is total logged hours in a given period, join time_entry on employee_id and sum hours grouped by employee within the defined time window; if the metric involves utilization or time_slice, join team_member and aggregate time_slice across active projects. If no explicit metric is defined in step 1, compute at least: (a) total logged hours per employee over a reasonable standard period such as the last 30 days, and (b) number of distinct projects from time_entry or team_member, documenting that these are used as a proxy for busyness. Ensure searches for employee ids and project ids account for potential typos or inconsistent naming via fuzzy matching only when exact joins fail. Produce a per-employee record containing identifiers and computed metrics, and a derived busyness_score (for example, equal to total_hours if no more complex formula is defined).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"location_filtered":{"type":"string"},"metric_used":{"type":"string"},"employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"num_projects":{"type":"integer"},"busyness_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name","busyness_score"]}}},"required":["location_filtered","metric_used","employees"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each requirement:

1. **Vienna Employee Identification**: I searched for employees with location matching 'Vienna' using exact and fuzzy matching. Found 4 employees in "Vienna Office – Austria" location.

2. **Company-Defined Metric Used**: From Step 1, the metric was defined as "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects". I used exactly this metric.

3. **Workload Computation**: For each Vienna employee, I computed:
   - Total FTE allocation (TimeSlice sum) across all active projects = busyness_score
   - Number of active projects (from FTE allocations)
   - Total logged hours (last 30 days as reasonable period)
   - Projects from time entries

4. **Data Sources**: Used only non-sensitive columns (id, name) from employees. All data came from function returns:
   - `list_all_employees()` for all employees
   - `search_projects(status=['active'])` for active projects
   - `get_project()` for team allocations
   - `search_time_entries()` for time data

5. **No State Changes**: I only read data - no update functions were called.

6. **All Facts Verified**: Every value in the JSON output was printed from function returns:
   - 4 Vienna employees with names and IDs
   - Jonas Schneider: 0.50 FTE from 2 active projects
   - Other employees: 0.00 FTE, 0 projects
   - All have 0 hours logged in last 30 days (printed totals were 0.00)

The results show Jonas Schneider is the busiest employee in Vienna with a busyness score of 0.50 FTE, allocated to 2 active projects.

{
  "location_filtered": "Vienna",
  "metric_used": "sum of allocated FTE slices (TimeSlice) across active projects",
  "employees": [
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_033",
      "employee_name": "Jonas Schneider",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 2,
      "busyness_score": 0.5
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_032",
      "employee_name": "Tim Hoffmann",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_034",
      "employee_name": "Kim Bender",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    },
    {
      "employee_id": "6KR2_035",
      "employee_name": "Matthias Schuster",
      "total_hours": 0.0,
      "num_projects": 0,
      "busyness_score": 0.0
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The busiest employee in Vienna is Jonas Schneider (employee ID: 6KR2_033) with a busyness score of 0.50, which is the sum of allocated FTE (TimeSlice) across all active projects, as defined by company policy. Three other Vienna employees (Tim Hoffmann, Kim Bender, Matthias Schuster) have a busyness score of 0.0. Therefore, Jonas Schneider is unambiguously the busiest employee in Vienna according to the standard company workload metric.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
