DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:07:00
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 of the plan was fully executed and returned results strictly as expected by the original plan. There is no unexpected result or missing information at this stage. The next logical action is to proceed with Step 2 as outlined: identifying the concrete technical implementation for managing 'order more paint' requests. No replan or abort is necessary at this time, since the plan is still on track and theoretically achievable.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:12:42
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
According to the original plan, if Step 2 finds that no concrete technical implementation exists to store or manage a 'request to order more paint' (implementation_found: false), the process must schedule an explicit abort as required by company planning rules: 'If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.' Step 2 has returned implementation_found: false, with full verification and no technical implementation found. Therefore, the correct next step (Step 6) is to abort the operational task due to missing system functionality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:31:21
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan is being followed strictly and all results match the expected output for each step. Steps 1-3 have been completed, with Step 2 returning that no concrete technical implementation (database, API, service) for 'request to order more paint' was found (implementation_found: false). The plan explicitly states in Step 6 that if this condition is met, an explicit abort of the operational task MUST be scheduled due to missing system functionality, and workarounds must not be attempted. Steps 4 and 5 are not needed to establish this, as Step 2 already precludes successful task execution. Therefore, the correct action is to continue to Step 4, but only to gather team member info required for an explicit, transparent abort as required in Step 6.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:32:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan has been strictly followed and all steps so far have returned relevant and expected results per the original plan. Step 2 clearly established that there is no technical implementation (database table, service, or API) to store or manage a 'request to order more paint' — implementation_found is false. According to the original plan wording and company rules, this mandates an explicit abortion in Step 6: 'If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.' The next step, Step 6, matches the observed context; it is not possible to continue to the creation of the request. There has been no need for replanning as results are not anomalous or inconsistent—simply negative, as allowed by the plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:34:30
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
According to the results from Step 2, there is no technical implementation (database table, API, or service) available to store or manage a 'request to order more paint' in any system at Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. Step 6 in the original plan strictly requires aborting the operational task if no supporting system is implemented. All previous steps have produced relevant and correct results, and there are no discrepancies or indications to replan remaining steps. Company rules further prohibit creative workarounds or persisting such requests in any alternate system. Therefore, the next action must be to explicitly continue to Step 6, which will produce an abort record in strict compliance with planning and company policy.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:35:56
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
According to the completed steps and the original plan, Step 6 established that no technical implementation exists for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint', and per company planning rules and explicit instructions ('If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.'), the task must be aborted. The plan does not permit workarounds, and all expected outputs and required checks have been performed and validated through function returns. The operational task cannot proceed further, and Step 7 is inapplicable as its precondition (existing technical implementation) fails.
