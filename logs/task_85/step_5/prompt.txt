Step 5: Determine the identity and permissions of the current user (BwFV_001, Manuela Valli) to confirm whether they are allowed to create or schedule a 'request to order more paint' for the identified project.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-style lookup (or equivalent) to retrieve the current user’s employee record from the employee table by id = 'BwFV_001', including department and location. Combine this with any available role or permission information from company policy or authorization subsystems to evaluate whether this user, in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy, is authorized to initiate or schedule material or purchase requests in the target system identified in Step 2, and specifically to do so in relation to the project identified in Step 3. If permissions are driven by project roles (e.g., only project Leads), cross-check against team_member records (from Step 4) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** mapping between roles described in policy and the 'role' values stored (Lead, Engineer, etc.). Output a boolean flag indicating whether this user can proceed with creating such a request for this project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_create_paint_order_request":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_basis":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","can_create_paint_order_request"]}
