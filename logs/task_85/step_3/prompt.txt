Step 3: Locate the project corresponding to 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' in the project table, resolving potential naming issues.
Approach: Query the project table first by exact match on project.name = 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) normalize both the search string and project.name to lowercase and remove extra whitespace, then perform a 'name contains' search; (2) perform **FUZZY** matching (e.g., similarity scoring) of the given name against all project.name values to handle typos or small differences (for example, 'Eco friendly top coat concept study', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study proj'); (3) if still ambiguous, apply **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search considering related terms like 'eco', 'topcoat', 'coating', 'concept', and 'study', and also search in the project.description field. If multiple high-confidence candidates emerge, select the best match by highest similarity score but also record all candidates and their scores. Prefer exact and unique matches over fuzzy ones.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"matched_project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["project_found"]}
