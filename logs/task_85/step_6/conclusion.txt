Step 6 has been executed according to the instructions. I evaluated the result from Step 2 which confirmed that no technical implementation exists for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint' (implementation_found = false). Following company planning rules, I constructed an explicit abort decision without attempting any workarounds. All facts were verified from function returns and previous step results. No state-changing functions were called, and no object states were altered.

{
  "should_abort": true,
  "abort_reason": "No supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint'. According to company planning rules, the operational task must be aborted when required system functionality is missing.",
  "related_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "related_has_team_members": true
}
