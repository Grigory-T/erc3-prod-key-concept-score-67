Step 6: If no technical implementation exists to store or manage a 'request to order more paint', schedule an explicit abort of the operational task due to missing system functionality, as required by company planning rules.
Approach: Evaluate the result of Step 2. If implementation_found is false, construct an explicit abort decision stating that the requested action (scheduling a request to order more paint) cannot be executed because no supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented. Do not attempt any workaround (such as misusing other tables like project or wiki_file) and do not log or persist the request elsewhere, in strict accordance with the rule: 'If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.' Prepare a structured abort payload capturing the reason, linked project_id (if any from Step 3), and the fact that team members might or might not exist (from Step 4), for transparency.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"should_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":"string"},"related_project_id":{"type":"string"},"related_has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["should_abort"]}
