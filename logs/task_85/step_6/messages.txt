## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-25
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_001
User details: {"id": "BwFV_001", "name": "Manuela Valli", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** For project  Eco-friendly topcoat concept study, if it has some team members assigned, schedule a request to order more paint

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal company documentation (wiki) for any defined process or guideline on how to 'schedule a request to order more paint' or to request ordering materials (paint) for a project.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table and any available wiki search functionality using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms and possible abbreviations such as 'order paint', 'paint order', 'material request', 'purchase request', 'procurement', 'supply request', and 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study'. Account for typos, plural forms, and synonyms (e.g., 'coating', 'topcoat', 'raw materials'). Use partial matching (substring search), fuzzy string comparison, and semantic search over wiki_file.content and wiki_file.path. If multiple relevant documents are found, identify the most relevant one(s) that describe how to create or schedule such a request, and extract key details: what system is used, what data is required (e.g., project identifier, quantity, justification), and who is allowed to submit requests.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"process_found":{"type":"boolean"},"wiki_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"process_summary":{"type":"string"},"identified_target_systems":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["process_found"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 1 by comprehensively searching the company wiki using the specified approach. I performed:

1. **Fuzzy searches** using `search_wiki_fuzzy()` for all specified terms: 'order paint', 'paint order', 'material request', 'purchase request', 'procurement', 'supply request', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study', 'coating', 'topcoat', 'raw materials', 'order materials', 'request materials'

2. **Semantic/logical searches** using regex patterns to match variations and partial terms across wiki content

3. **Examination of relevant files** that were identified through the searches, particularly:
   - `operations/factories_and_production.md`
   - `systems/project_registry.md`

4. **Extraction of key details** from the found content:
   - **System used**: "central Progress‑based systems" (from operations/factories_and_production.md line 63)
   - **Data required**: "Production orders and recipes (derived from project outcomes and product master data)" (same source)
   - **Who is allowed**: Not explicitly specified in the found documentation

The search revealed that production orders (which would include ordering paint/materials for projects) are handled through the central Progress-based systems and are derived from project outcomes. However, no explicit step-by-step procedure for "scheduling a request to order more paint" specifically for a project was found in the wiki documentation.

All facts were verified from function returns - I printed all search results and examined the actual content. No data was invented or assumed.

{
  "process_found": true,
  "wiki_paths": ["operations/factories_and_production.md", "systems/project_registry.md"],
  "process_summary": "The wiki documentation indicates that production orders (which would include ordering paint/materials for projects) are derived from project outcomes and product master data. Both production plants rely on central Progress-based systems for handling production orders and recipes. Projects are categorized into types (customer development, customer supply, internal R&D, internal process/IT) that may require materials. Production supervisors are encouraged to link improvement or troubleshooting efforts to projects and log time accordingly. However, no explicit step-by-step procedure for 'scheduling a request to order more paint' specifically for a project was found in the documentation.",
  "identified_target_systems": ["Progress-based systems"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, services, or APIs) used to store or manage 'order more paint' or material purchase requests, based on documentation and available schema.
Approach: Using information from Step 1 and available technical documentation, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for any implemented entities related to purchase or material orders. This includes scanning known database schemas (information_schema or similar) and internal API/service catalogs for objects whose names or descriptions contain terms like 'purchase_order', 'material_order', 'material_request', 'replenishment_request', 'procurement', 'supply_order', or similar, accounting for typos, abbreviations, and variants. Prefer exact name matches if found, then fall back to partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching. Determine whether a concrete, supported system exists to record a 'request to order more paint' and, if so, capture the primary storage mechanism (e.g., a table name or service endpoint) and required core fields, including any linkage to projects.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_type":{"type":"string"},"storage_identifiers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"required_core_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I have verified that I executed Step 2 exactly as instructed. I performed exhaustive fuzzy and semantic/logical searches across all available company wiki documentation (19 files total) for concrete technical implementation details of material purchase/order systems.

The search confirmed:
1. No database schema documentation exists in the wiki
2. No API/service catalog documentation exists
3. No concrete table names, field specifications, or technical implementation details are documented
4. The only reference found is conceptual: "Production orders and recipes (derived from project outcomes and product master data)" in operations/factories_and_production.md
5. Multiple files reference "Progress OpenEdge" systems but provide no technical details

All facts are verified from function returns: I printed the results of list_wiki(), search_wiki_fuzzy(), load_wiki(), and search_wiki() calls. No data was invented or assumed.

Since the documentation lacks concrete technical implementation details (database tables, APIs, services), the result must be implementation_found: false.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "storage_type": "",
  "storage_identifiers": [],
  "required_core_fields": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the project corresponding to 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' in the project table, resolving potential naming issues.
Approach: Query the project table first by exact match on project.name = 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) normalize both the search string and project.name to lowercase and remove extra whitespace, then perform a 'name contains' search; (2) perform **FUZZY** matching (e.g., similarity scoring) of the given name against all project.name values to handle typos or small differences (for example, 'Eco friendly top coat concept study', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study proj'); (3) if still ambiguous, apply **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search considering related terms like 'eco', 'topcoat', 'coating', 'concept', and 'study', and also search in the project.description field. If multiple high-confidence candidates emerge, select the best match by highest similarity score but also record all candidates and their scores. Prefer exact and unique matches over fuzzy ones.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"matched_project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["project_found"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 3. All facts are derived from function returns with no assumptions made:

1. **Exact match verification**: Found exactly one project with name "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" (ID: `proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea`)
2. **Fuzzy matching verification**: Ran `fuzzy_compare()` which returned the top 10 matches with similarity scores
3. **Candidate mapping**: Created a direct mapping from the fuzzy results to actual project IDs using the `name_to_id` dictionary
4. **All data verified**: Every project ID, name, and similarity score in the JSON output comes directly from function returns

The verification confirmed:
- Exact match: Project ID `proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea` with 100% similarity
- Fuzzy candidates: All 10 candidates with their similarity scores (ranging from 1.0 to 0.356)
- No state-changing functions were called (only read operations)

The approach followed all instructions: started with exact match, then substring search, then fuzzy matching, and considered semantic variations. The exact match was found, so it was selected as the best match with 100% confidence.

    },
    {

      "project_name": "Workshop coating standards and training",

    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the located project 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' has any team members assigned in the team_member table.
Approach: If Step 3 returned project_found = true, query the team_member table for all records with team_member.project_id equal to the identified project_id. Use an exact match on project_id; handle any potential discrepancies with **FUZZY** or partial matching only if there is evidence that project_id formatting may be inconsistent (for example, minor typos or prefix differences), but prefer exact id matches. Count the number of team members and retrieve their employee_id and role. If Step 3 did not find a project, skip querying team_member and instead return an empty list and a count of zero, with has_team_members set to false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"},"team_member_count":{"type":"integer"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","role"]}}},"required":["has_team_members","team_member_count"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I queried the team members for the project "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" using the exact project ID from Step 3. All facts were verified from function returns: the project was found via get_project(), and the team list was extracted directly from the ProjectFull object. No assumptions were made, no state-changing functions were called, and all data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "has_team_members": true,
  "team_member_count": 2,
  "team_members": [
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_049", "role": "Lead"},
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_025", "role": "Engineer"}
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the identity and permissions of the current user (BwFV_001, Manuela Valli) to confirm whether they are allowed to create or schedule a 'request to order more paint' for the identified project.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-style lookup (or equivalent) to retrieve the current user’s employee record from the employee table by id = 'BwFV_001', including department and location. Combine this with any available role or permission information from company policy or authorization subsystems to evaluate whether this user, in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy, is authorized to initiate or schedule material or purchase requests in the target system identified in Step 2, and specifically to do so in relation to the project identified in Step 3. If permissions are driven by project roles (e.g., only project Leads), cross-check against team_member records (from Step 4) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** mapping between roles described in policy and the 'role' values stored (Lead, Engineer, etc.). Output a boolean flag indicating whether this user can proceed with creating such a request for this project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_create_paint_order_request":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_basis":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","can_create_paint_order_request"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 and confirm it was completed according to the instructions. All actions were performed, and all facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions made:

1. **Current user context verification**: Used `who_am_i()` to get exact user identity - BwFV_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy
2. **Employee record verification**: Used `get_employee("BwFV_001")` to confirm employee details - Manuela Valli, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy
3. **Project team verification**: Used `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea")` to check team membership - user is NOT in the project team
4. **Permission analysis**: Combined user's executive department with company rules about executive permissions for project operations
5. **No state-changing functions** were called - only read operations
6. **All data in JSON output** comes from explicitly printed function returns

No actions were skipped. The approach included checking both project team roles and executive permissions as instructed. Since no concrete implementation was found in Step 2 for paint order requests, the permission determination is based on the user's executive role in Corporate Leadership, which according to company rules grants broad project operation permissions.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_001",
  "employee_name": "Manuela Valli",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "can_create_paint_order_request": true,
  "permission_basis": "Executive role in Corporate Leadership grants broad project operation permissions, including the ability to initiate material requests for any project."
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 6: If no technical implementation exists to store or manage a 'request to order more paint', schedule an explicit abort of the operational task due to missing system functionality, as required by company planning rules.
Approach: Evaluate the result of Step 2. If implementation_found is false, construct an explicit abort decision stating that the requested action (scheduling a request to order more paint) cannot be executed because no supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented. Do not attempt any workaround (such as misusing other tables like project or wiki_file) and do not log or persist the request elsewhere, in strict accordance with the rule: 'If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.' Prepare a structured abort payload capturing the reason, linked project_id (if any from Step 3), and the fact that team members might or might not exist (from Step 4), for transparency.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"should_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":"string"},"related_project_id":{"type":"string"},"related_has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["should_abort"]}

I'll execute Step 6 by evaluating the result from Step 2 and constructing the abort decision as required.

```python
# Step 6: Evaluate Step 2 result and prepare abort decision

# First, let's verify the current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, Department: {ctx.department}, Location: {ctx.location}")

# Based on Step 2 result from the task history
# From Step 2 output: implementation_found = false
# This means no concrete technical implementation exists

# From Step 3: project_found = true, project_id = "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea"
# From Step 4: has_team_members = true

# Construct abort decision
should_abort = True
abort_reason = "No supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint'. According to company planning rules, the operational task must be aborted when required system functionality is missing."
related_project_id = "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea"
related_has_team_members = True

print(f"Step 2 implementation_found: false")
print(f"Should abort: {should_abort}")
print(f"Abort reason: {abort_reason}")
print(f"Related project ID: {related_project_id}")
print(f"Related project has team members: {related_has_team_members}")

Step 6 has been executed. I evaluated the result from Step 2 which showed that no concrete technical implementation exists for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint' (implementation_found = false). According to company planning rules, when required system functionality is missing, the operational task must be aborted. Therefore, I have constructed an explicit abort decision with the required details, including the related project ID and team member status from previous steps.

The task to "schedule a request to order more paint" for project "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" cannot proceed due to missing system functionality.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have verified the execution of Step 6. Let me confirm each point in the checklist:

1. **Did you execute the step instruction?** Yes, I evaluated the result of Step 2 (implementation_found = false) and constructed an explicit abort decision.

2. **Is there any action you skipped or assumed?** No, I followed the exact approach: evaluated Step 2 result, constructed abort decision with required details, and did not attempt any workarounds.

3. **Are all facts verified (not assumed)?** Yes, all facts were verified:
   - Step 2 result: `implementation_found: false` was confirmed in the execution output
   - Project ID: `proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea` came from Step 3 results
   - Team members status: `has_team_members: true` came from Step 4 results
   - Current user context: Verified via `who_am_i()` in the code execution

4. **JSON response contains ONLY values explicitly printed/verified:** Yes, all values in the JSON were explicitly printed in the execution output.

5. **No make-up data or sensible defaults:** All data came from previous step results or function returns.

6. **No state-changing functions were called:** Only read operations were performed (who_am_i()).

7. **No changes to object state:** No update functions were called, so no state changes occurred.

The step was completed exactly as instructed. The abort decision is based on the confirmed absence of technical implementation from Step 2, which aligns with company planning rules requiring abortion when system functionality is missing.
