I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I queried the team members for the project "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" using the exact project ID from Step 3. All facts were verified from function returns: the project was found via get_project(), and the team list was extracted directly from the ProjectFull object. No assumptions were made, no state-changing functions were called, and all data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "has_team_members": true,
  "team_member_count": 2,
  "team_members": [
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_049", "role": "Lead"},
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_025", "role": "Engineer"}
  ]
}
