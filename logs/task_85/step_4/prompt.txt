Step 4: Check whether the located project 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' has any team members assigned in the team_member table.
Approach: If Step 3 returned project_found = true, query the team_member table for all records with team_member.project_id equal to the identified project_id. Use an exact match on project_id; handle any potential discrepancies with **FUZZY** or partial matching only if there is evidence that project_id formatting may be inconsistent (for example, minor typos or prefix differences), but prefer exact id matches. Count the number of team members and retrieve their employee_id and role. If Step 3 did not find a project, skip querying team_member and instead return an empty list and a count of zero, with has_team_members set to false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"},"team_member_count":{"type":"integer"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","role"]}}},"required":["has_team_members","team_member_count"]}
