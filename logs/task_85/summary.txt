## Execution Summary (abort)

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal company documentation (wiki) for any defined process or guideline on how to 'schedule a request to order more paint' or to request ordering materials (paint) for a project.
Approach: Query the wiki_file table and any available wiki search functionality using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for terms and possible abbreviations such as 'order paint', 'paint order', 'material request', 'purchase request', 'procurement', 'supply request', and 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study'. Account for typos, plural forms, and synonyms (e.g., 'coating', 'topcoat', 'raw materials'). Use partial matching (substring search), fuzzy string comparison, and semantic search over wiki_file.content and wiki_file.path. If multiple relevant documents are found, identify the most relevant one(s) that describe how to create or schedule such a request, and extract key details: what system is used, what data is required (e.g., project identifier, quantity, justification), and who is allowed to submit requests.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"process_found":{"type":"boolean"},"wiki_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"process_summary":{"type":"string"},"identified_target_systems":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["process_found"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 1 by comprehensively searching the company wiki using the specified approach. I performed:

1. **Fuzzy searches** using `search_wiki_fuzzy()` for all specified terms: 'order paint', 'paint order', 'material request', 'purchase request', 'procurement', 'supply request', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study', 'coating', 'topcoat', 'raw materials', 'order materials', 'request materials'

2. **Semantic/logical searches** using regex patterns to match variations and partial terms across wiki content

3. **Examination of relevant files** that were identified through the searches, particularly:
   - `operations/factories_and_production.md`
   - `systems/project_registry.md`

4. **Extraction of key details** from the found content:
   - **System used**: "central Progress‑based systems" (from operations/factories_and_production.md line 63)
   - **Data required**: "Production orders and recipes (derived from project outcomes and product master data)" (same source)
   - **Who is allowed**: Not explicitly specified in the found documentation

The search revealed that production orders (which would include ordering paint/materials for projects) are handled through the central Progress-based systems and are derived from project outcomes. However, no explicit step-by-step procedure for "scheduling a request to order more paint" specifically for a project was found in the wiki documentation.

All facts were verified from function returns - I printed all search results and examined the actual content. No data was invented or assumed.

{
  "process_found": true,
  "wiki_paths": ["operations/factories_and_production.md", "systems/project_registry.md"],
  "process_summary": "The wiki documentation indicates that production orders (which would include ordering paint/materials for projects) are derived from project outcomes and product master data. Both production plants rely on central Progress-based systems for handling production orders and recipes. Projects are categorized into types (customer development, customer supply, internal R&D, internal process/IT) that may require materials. Production supervisors are encouraged to link improvement or troubleshooting efforts to projects and log time accordingly. However, no explicit step-by-step procedure for 'scheduling a request to order more paint' specifically for a project was found in the documentation.",
  "identified_target_systems": ["Progress-based systems"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, services, or APIs) used to store or manage 'order more paint' or material purchase requests, based on documentation and available schema.
Approach: Using information from Step 1 and available technical documentation, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search for any implemented entities related to purchase or material orders. This includes scanning known database schemas (information_schema or similar) and internal API/service catalogs for objects whose names or descriptions contain terms like 'purchase_order', 'material_order', 'material_request', 'replenishment_request', 'procurement', 'supply_order', or similar, accounting for typos, abbreviations, and variants. Prefer exact name matches if found, then fall back to partial, fuzzy, and semantic matching. Determine whether a concrete, supported system exists to record a 'request to order more paint' and, if so, capture the primary storage mechanism (e.g., a table name or service endpoint) and required core fields, including any linkage to projects.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"implementation_found":{"type":"boolean"},"storage_type":{"type":"string"},"storage_identifiers":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"required_core_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["implementation_found"]}
**Result:** I have verified that I executed Step 2 exactly as instructed. I performed exhaustive fuzzy and semantic/logical searches across all available company wiki documentation (19 files total) for concrete technical implementation details of material purchase/order systems.

The search confirmed:
1. No database schema documentation exists in the wiki
2. No API/service catalog documentation exists
3. No concrete table names, field specifications, or technical implementation details are documented
4. The only reference found is conceptual: "Production orders and recipes (derived from project outcomes and product master data)" in operations/factories_and_production.md
5. Multiple files reference "Progress OpenEdge" systems but provide no technical details

All facts are verified from function returns: I printed the results of list_wiki(), search_wiki_fuzzy(), load_wiki(), and search_wiki() calls. No data was invented or assumed.

Since the documentation lacks concrete technical implementation details (database tables, APIs, services), the result must be implementation_found: false.

{
  "implementation_found": false,
  "storage_type": "",
  "storage_identifiers": [],
  "required_core_fields": []
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the project corresponding to 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' in the project table, resolving potential naming issues.
Approach: Query the project table first by exact match on project.name = 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) normalize both the search string and project.name to lowercase and remove extra whitespace, then perform a 'name contains' search; (2) perform **FUZZY** matching (e.g., similarity scoring) of the given name against all project.name values to handle typos or small differences (for example, 'Eco friendly top coat concept study', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study proj'); (3) if still ambiguous, apply **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search considering related terms like 'eco', 'topcoat', 'coating', 'concept', and 'study', and also search in the project.description field. If multiple high-confidence candidates emerge, select the best match by highest similarity score but also record all candidates and their scores. Prefer exact and unique matches over fuzzy ones.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"matched_project_name":{"type":"string"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"similarity_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","project_name","similarity_score"]}}},"required":["project_found"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 3. All facts are derived from function returns with no assumptions made:

1. **Exact match verification**: Found exactly one project with name "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" (ID: `proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea`)
2. **Fuzzy matching verification**: Ran `fuzzy_compare()` which returned the top 10 matches with similarity scores
3. **Candidate mapping**: Created a direct mapping from the fuzzy results to actual project IDs using the `name_to_id` dictionary
4. **All data verified**: Every project ID, name, and similarity score in the JSON output comes directly from function returns

The verification confirmed:
- Exact match: Project ID `proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea` with 100% similarity
- Fuzzy candidates: All 10 candidates with their similarity scores (ranging from 1.0 to 0.356)
- No state-changing functions were called (only read operations)

The approach followed all instructions: started with exact match, then substring search, then fuzzy matching, and considered semantic variations. The exact match was found, so it was selected as the best match with 100% confidence.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "matched_project_name": "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study",
  "match_confidence": 1.0,
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
      "project_name": "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study",
      "similarity_score": 1.0
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_carpathia_powder_topcoat_crossover",
      "project_name": "Liquid-to-powder topcoat crossover support",
      "similarity_score": 0.474
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_iberia_fire_protection_cert",
      "project_name": "Fire-protection topcoat certification",
      "similarity_score": 0.451
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system",
      "project_name": "Bogie component coating system",
      "similarity_score": 0.438
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_centraleauto_ecoat_interface",
      "project_name": "Pre-treatment interface for e-coat line",
      "similarity_score": 0.411
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_euro_flooring_warehouse_system",
      "project_name": "Warehouse floor coating system",
      "similarity_score": 0.406
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_novaauto_ecoat_primer_trial",
      "project_name": "E-coat compatible primer trial",
      "similarity_score": 0.375
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
      "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
      "similarity_score": 0.371
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "project_name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "similarity_score": 0.364
    },
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards",
      "project_name": "Workshop coating standards and training",
      "similarity_score": 0.356
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the located project 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study' has any team members assigned in the team_member table.
Approach: If Step 3 returned project_found = true, query the team_member table for all records with team_member.project_id equal to the identified project_id. Use an exact match on project_id; handle any potential discrepancies with **FUZZY** or partial matching only if there is evidence that project_id formatting may be inconsistent (for example, minor typos or prefix differences), but prefer exact id matches. Count the number of team members and retrieve their employee_id and role. If Step 3 did not find a project, skip querying team_member and instead return an empty list and a count of zero, with has_team_members set to false.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"},"team_member_count":{"type":"integer"},"team_members":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","role"]}}},"required":["has_team_members","team_member_count"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I queried the team members for the project "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" using the exact project ID from Step 3. All facts were verified from function returns: the project was found via get_project(), and the team list was extracted directly from the ProjectFull object. No assumptions were made, no state-changing functions were called, and all data in the JSON output comes from explicitly printed function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "has_team_members": true,
  "team_member_count": 2,
  "team_members": [
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_049", "role": "Lead"},
    {"employee_id": "BwFV_025", "role": "Engineer"}
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the identity and permissions of the current user (BwFV_001, Manuela Valli) to confirm whether they are allowed to create or schedule a 'request to order more paint' for the identified project.
Approach: Use a who_am_i-style lookup (or equivalent) to retrieve the current user’s employee record from the employee table by id = 'BwFV_001', including department and location. Combine this with any available role or permission information from company policy or authorization subsystems to evaluate whether this user, in the Corporate Leadership department at HQ – Italy, is authorized to initiate or schedule material or purchase requests in the target system identified in Step 2, and specifically to do so in relation to the project identified in Step 3. If permissions are driven by project roles (e.g., only project Leads), cross-check against team_member records (from Step 4) using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** mapping between roles described in policy and the 'role' values stored (Lead, Engineer, etc.). Output a boolean flag indicating whether this user can proceed with creating such a request for this project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_create_paint_order_request":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_basis":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","can_create_paint_order_request"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 5 and confirm it was completed according to the instructions. All actions were performed, and all facts were verified from function returns with no assumptions made:

1. **Current user context verification**: Used `who_am_i()` to get exact user identity - BwFV_001, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy
2. **Employee record verification**: Used `get_employee("BwFV_001")` to confirm employee details - Manuela Valli, Corporate Leadership, HQ – Italy
3. **Project team verification**: Used `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea")` to check team membership - user is NOT in the project team
4. **Permission analysis**: Combined user's executive department with company rules about executive permissions for project operations
5. **No state-changing functions** were called - only read operations
6. **All data in JSON output** comes from explicitly printed function returns

No actions were skipped. The approach included checking both project team roles and executive permissions as instructed. Since no concrete implementation was found in Step 2 for paint order requests, the permission determination is based on the user's executive role in Corporate Leadership, which according to company rules grants broad project operation permissions.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_001",
  "employee_name": "Manuela Valli",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "can_create_paint_order_request": true,
  "permission_basis": "Executive role in Corporate Leadership grants broad project operation permissions, including the ability to initiate material requests for any project."
}

### Step 6
Step 6: If no technical implementation exists to store or manage a 'request to order more paint', schedule an explicit abort of the operational task due to missing system functionality, as required by company planning rules.
Approach: Evaluate the result of Step 2. If implementation_found is false, construct an explicit abort decision stating that the requested action (scheduling a request to order more paint) cannot be executed because no supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented. Do not attempt any workaround (such as misusing other tables like project or wiki_file) and do not log or persist the request elsewhere, in strict accordance with the rule: 'If direct api/functions for task completion is absent - schedule explicit abortion step. DO NOT BE CREATIVE.' Prepare a structured abort payload capturing the reason, linked project_id (if any from Step 3), and the fact that team members might or might not exist (from Step 4), for transparency.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"should_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":"string"},"related_project_id":{"type":"string"},"related_has_team_members":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["should_abort"]}
**Result:** Step 6 has been executed according to the instructions. I evaluated the result from Step 2 which confirmed that no technical implementation exists for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint' (implementation_found = false). Following company planning rules, I constructed an explicit abort decision without attempting any workarounds. All facts were verified from function returns and previous step results. No state-changing functions were called, and no object states were altered.

{
  "should_abort": true,
  "abort_reason": "No supporting system (database table, service, or API) is implemented for storing or managing a 'request to order more paint'. According to company planning rules, the operational task must be aborted when required system functionality is missing.",
  "related_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "related_has_team_members": true
}

### Final Result
Task aborted: Task aborted: No supporting system (database table, service, or API) exists for managing or storing a 'request to order more paint'. Per company policy and planning rules, the task cannot proceed without such implementation, and no workaround is allowed.
