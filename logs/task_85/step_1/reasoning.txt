We are in Step 1: Search internal company documentation (wiki) for any defined process or guideline on how to 'schedule a request to order more paint' or to request ordering materials (paint) for a project.

We need to use fuzzy and semantic search over the wiki. We have functions: list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki (regex), search_wiki_fuzzy (fuzzy search). We'll use these to search for the terms.

Approach:
1. List all wiki files to get an overview (optional, but we can do it to see the structure).
2. Use fuzzy search with a list of keywords: ['order paint', 'paint order', 'material request', 'purchase request', 'procurement', 'supply request', 'Eco-friendly topcoat concept study', 'coating', 'topcoat', 'raw materials'].
3. Also use regex search for common patterns (like "order" and "paint" near each other).
4. Analyze the results to find the most relevant documents and extract key details.

We'll do:
- search_wiki_fuzzy with the words list.
- search_wiki with a regex pattern that might capture the process.

But note: search_wiki_fuzzy takes a list of words and returns matches for each word. We'll use a list of words from the terms, but we can break the phrases into individual words? The function expects a list of words (strings). We can use:
   words = ['order', 'paint', 'material', 'request', 'purchase', 'procurement', 'supply', 'eco', 'friendly', 'topcoat', 'concept', 'study', 'coating', 'raw', 'materials']

However, the function search_wiki_fuzzy does fuzzy matching on each word. We might also want to search for phrases. We can use search_wiki with a regex that looks for phrases.

Let's start by listing the wiki files to see if there are any obvious ones (like "procurement_process.md", "material_ordering.md", etc.). But the step says to use fuzzy and semantic search, so we'll do that.

We'll write code to:
1. Get the list of wiki files (optional, but we can print a few to see).
2. Use search_wiki_fuzzy with a list of words derived from the terms.
3. Use search_wiki with a regex pattern that might capture the process (e.g., "order.*paint" or "paint.*order").
4. Combine the results and identify the most relevant documents.

We'll then extract the content of the most relevant documents and summarize the process.

But note: we are expected to output:
{
  "process_found": boolean,
  "wiki_paths": array of strings (paths of relevant documents),
  "process_summary": string (summary of the process),
  "identified_target_systems": array of strings (systems used for the request)
}

We must be cautious about authorization: we are an authenticated user in Corporate Leadership, so we should have access to the wiki.

Let's execute.

We are facing a connection issue. Let's try a simpler approach first to see if the connection is stable.
 We'll start by checking the current user context and then try to list wiki files again.
 If it fails again, we might need to handle it differently.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #3] 2025-12-10 00:04:30
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have 19 wiki files. Let's list them all to see the full structure and then perform fuzzy searches.
 First, list all wiki files:
 We already have the first 10, let's see the rest. We'll print all.

[REASONING #4] 2025-12-10 00:05:49
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have found that only one file matches the keyword "project" in its path: `systems/project_registry.md`.
 We examined it and found some relevant lines (since the summary says "In file 'systems/project_registry.md': - **Customer supply projects**...").
 However, the summary is truncated. Let's load the file again and extract a more detailed summary, specifically looking for any process about ordering materials or paint.

 Since the step requires a fuzzy and semantic search, and we have already done a broad search, let's now focus on the content of `systems/project_registry.md` to see if it contains the desired process.

 We'll also check if there are any other files that might be relevant, especially those in operations or systems that might mention procurement or ordering.

 Let's load the `systems/project_registry.md` file and search for lines containing the words we are interested in.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #5] 2025-12-10 00:06:27
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have searched the wiki and found some relevant information, but we need to structure the output according to the expected format.
 Let's refine the summary and systems based on what we found.

 From the search, we found:
 1. The project registry documentation mentions project types (including customer development and supply projects).
 2. The operations documentation mentions that both plants rely on central Progress-based systems for production orders and recipes.
 3. However, we did not find a specific documented process for "scheduling a request to order more paint" for a project.

 Let's analyze:
 - We found references to "production orders" being derived from project outcomes and product master data.
 - We found that the central system is "Progress-based" (which might be an ERP system).

 But note: the search did not yield a clear step-by-step process for ordering paint for a project.

 Given the requirement for the step, we must output:
   process_found: boolean
   wiki_paths: array of strings (paths of relevant wiki documents)
   process_summary: string (summary of the process, if found)
   identified_target_systems: array of strings (systems used for the process)

 Since we didn't find an explicit process for ordering paint for a project, we can note what we found and indicate that the process is not explicitly documented.

 However, the instructions say: if a process is found, provide the summary and systems.

 Let's re-examine the most relevant section:

 In operations/factories_and_production.md, line 63:
   "Both plants rely on the central Progress‑based systems for: **Production orders and recipes** (derived from project outcomes and product master data)."

 This suggests that production orders (which could include ordering paint) are generated from project outcomes and are managed in the Progress system.

 We can infer that the process might be:
   1. Project outcomes (e.g., a formulation or requirement) are used to create production orders.
   2. These production orders are then handled by the central Progress-based system.

 But without a clear step-by-step, we can only report what we found.

 Let's set:
   process_found = True (because we found a mention of production orders and their relation to projects)
   wiki_paths = ['operations/factories_and_production.md', 'systems/project_registry.md'] (the two most relevant)
   process_summary = "The wiki indicates that production orders (which could include ordering paint) are derived from project outcomes and product master data, and are managed by the central Progress-based systems. However, no detailed step-by-step process for scheduling a paint order request for a project is explicitly documented."
   identified_target_systems = ["Progress-based systems"]

 We should note that the search did not yield a specific procurement or material ordering process for projects.

 However, the step asked for a search and to output what we found.

 Let's prepare the output accordingly.

We are asked to verify that we completed Step 1 correctly.
 We have already performed extensive searches and provided results.
 However, let's double-check that we didn't miss any key points:

 1. We used fuzzy and semantic search on the wiki for the given terms.
 2. We found that the most relevant documents are:
    - operations/factories_and_production.md
    - systems/project_registry.md
 3. We extracted that the system used is the "central Progress-based systems" (or simply "Progress").
 4. We did not find a detailed step-by-step process for ordering paint for a project, but we found that production orders are derived from project outcomes.

 Let's re-examine the operations/factories_and_production.md file for more specific details about the process.

 We saw in line 63 of operations/factories_and_production.md:
   "Both plants rely on the central Progress‑based systems for:"
   - **Production orders and recipes** (derived from project outcomes and product master data).

 This tells us:
   - System: Progress-based systems.
   - What data is required: project outcomes and product master data.

 However, we don't have explicit details on who is allowed to submit requests or the exact process of scheduling a request.

 We also note that the project registry describes project types and that projects are the source for production orders.

 Since the step asks for:
   - what system is used -> We have "Progress-based systems"
   - what data is required -> We have "project outcomes and product master data"
   - who is allowed to submit requests -> Not explicitly found, but we can infer from context (production supervisors, project managers?)

 Let's try to search for more specific terms in the wiki that might indicate roles or permissions for ordering.

 We'll do one more search for terms like "submit order", "create order", "order request", etc.

 But note: we must not change state, only read.

 Let's run a quick search for these terms in the wiki using the search_wiki_fuzzy function.
