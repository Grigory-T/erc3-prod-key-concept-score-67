Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure the current user is allowed to see their own projects and team compositions.
Approach: Use the bound identity of the current user (employee id from Step 4) and the company rules to perform a who_am_i-style authorization check. Confirm that the user is querying only their own projects ('my projects'), which should allow reading team_member and project data except for any restricted fields like salaries or confidential notes. Explicitly verify there is no requirement for special system roles to read this information. If the policy engine denies access, note the denial and stop further data-related steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"},"checked_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_view_projects"]}
