Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by performing a who_am_i-style authorization check and reviewing the company rules. I verified that the current user (Bhwa_028) is authenticated and there are no company rules restricting access to view their own projects and team compositions. The company rules only restrict mutation of project data (CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields, etc.) which require specific roles, but reading project data is permitted for authenticated users. I did not skip any actions - I explicitly checked the user context, authentication status, and reviewed all relevant company rules. All facts were verified from function returns: who_am_i() confirmed the user is authenticated, and get_employee() confirmed the user's identity matches Step 4 results. No state-changing functions were called during this step.

{
  "can_view_projects": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rules restrict reading one's own projects and team compositions. Rules only restrict mutation of project data, not reading.",
  "checked_roles": []
}
