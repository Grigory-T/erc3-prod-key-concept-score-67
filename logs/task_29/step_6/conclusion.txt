STEP 6 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 20:39:20

I have executed Step 6 according to the instructions and completed thorough verification. The step involved retrieving all projects where the current user (Bhwa_028) is a team member, representing 'my projects' without filtering on project status.

**Execution Summary:**
1. **Used exact employee ID matching**: I queried the `team_member` table indirectly via the `search_projects()` function with `team_employee='Bhwa_028'` as specified in the approach.
2. **Included all statuses**: Used `include_archived=True` to ensure no projects were filtered out based on status.
3. **Verified completeness**: I performed additional verification by:
   - Checking the full project details of the found project to confirm team membership
   - Sampling 15 projects (3 pages) from the entire project list and checking each for user membership
   - Searching for related projects to ensure no projects were missed due to query limitations
4. **Found exactly one project**: The user is a team member in only one project: `proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts` (Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade)
5. **No state-changing functions were called**: Only read operations were performed.

**Verification Details:**
- `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)` returned exactly one project
- `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")` confirmed the user's team membership: Role = Lead, Time slice = 0.4
- Sampled 15 projects from the project list: Only the same project contained the user as a team member
- No other projects with the user as team member were found in any verification checks

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions made.
