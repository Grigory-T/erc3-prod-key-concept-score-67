Step 6: Retrieve all projects where the current user is a team member, representing 'my projects', without filtering on project status.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 (assuming permissions from Step 5 allow it), query the team_member table for all rows with team_member.employee_id equal to that id (exact match on id). Join these rows to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to get project names and identifiers. Because this lookup is by internal id, exact matching is preferred; fuzzy or semantic matching is not needed here. Collect a distinct list of all such projects across all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) without excluding any based on status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_count"]}
