## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-26
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_028
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_028", "name": "Pieter van der Linden", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "Rotterdam Office \u2013 Netherlands"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Which of my projects doesn't have somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand what 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' mean in the company context, including whether this maps to a specific team member role label (for example role = 'QA') or any other convention.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file table and any other available company documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching for terms and abbreviations related to 'quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', and 'project team roles'. Interpret possible abbreviations or slang (for example 'QA' vs 'quality assurance engineer') using semantic similarity. If multiple meanings are found, identify which specifically relate to project teams and responsibility for quality assurance. This step only reads documentation; it does not access or modify any project or employee data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"qa_term_definitions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["qa_term_definitions","qa_role_labels","source_paths"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the company wiki documentation. The analysis reveals that "quality assurance" (QA) in the company context maps to specific role labels used in project teams and job titles. The most relevant finding is that in project teams, "QA" is one of the standard role labels in the project registry system alongside Lead, Engineer, Designer, Ops, and Other. Additionally, there are job titles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department. No explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term were found in the wiki, but the role conventions are clearly established in the project registry documentation.

{
  "qa_term_definitions": [],
  "qa_role_labels": ["QA", "QA Technician", "Quality Engineer", "Quality & HSE Manager"],
  "ambiguity_notes": ["The term 'QA' appears in two distinct contexts: 1) As a project team role label ('QA') in the project registry system, which is one of the standard roles (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other) assigned to team members. 2) As job titles in the Quality & HSE department (QA Technician, Quality Engineer, Quality & HSE Manager). For project team composition and responsibility for quality assurance, the role label 'QA' in the project registry is the relevant mapping."],
  "source_paths": ["systems/project_registry.md", "hr/people_and_roles.md"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, fields, or services) that represent projects, project team membership, and the role responsible for quality assurance.
Approach: Based on the schema and any technical documentation, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over available technical descriptions for entities like 'project', 'team member', 'role', and 'QA'. Confirm which tables and fields to use: for example, project for projects and team_member for membership with role values, and determine which role value(s) (for example 'QA') correspond to someone responsible for quality assurance, using the results from Step 1. If there are naming variations or typos in documentation (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), use fuzzy matching and partial matching to interpret them.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"implementation_entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["has_implementation","implementation_entities","qa_role_values"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by thoroughly searching the technical documentation. Let me verify and consolidate my findings:

**Execution Details:**
1. I searched the available wiki files for technical documentation about project implementation, team membership, and QA roles.
2. I examined the project registry documentation in detail (systems/project_registry.md) which explicitly defines:
   - Projects have a "team" field containing a list of team members
   - Each team member has: assigned employee, role, and time slice (fraction of FTE)
   - The role values are explicitly listed as: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other
3. I verified there are no other technical database tables, fields, or services mentioned in the available documentation beyond what's in the project registry.
4. I confirmed through fuzzy search that "QA" is the exact role value (not "Q/A", "QualityAssurance", or other variations).

**Verified Facts (from function returns):**
1. From `list_wiki()`: We have documentation files including "systems/project_registry.md"
2. From `load_wiki("systems/project_registry.md")`: Lines 34-36 and 67 explicitly state:
   - "Team and workloads:" 
   - "Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)"
   - "Role – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)"
3. From `search_wiki()` and `search_wiki_fuzzy()`: No other variations of QA role values were found in the technical documentation.
4. The available API functions (`get_project()`, `ProjectFull`, `TeamMember`) confirm this implementation structure matches the documentation.

**No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations on documentation.

**Conclusion:** The technical implementation uses the "project" entity with a "team" field containing "team_member" objects, and the QA role value is exactly "QA".

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "implementation_entities": ["project", "team_member"],
  "qa_role_values": ["QA"],
  "notes": "The project registry system defines projects with a 'team' field containing a list of team members. Each team member has: employee (ID), role (string), and time_slice (float). The role value for quality assurance responsibility is exactly 'QA' as documented in systems/project_registry.md lines 36 and 67. No other variations or alternative spellings were found in the technical documentation."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Abort the task if Step 2 determines that there is no suitable technical implementation to identify projects, team members, or a quality assurance responsibility role.
Approach: Inspect the output of Step 2. If has_implementation is false or the required entities (for example project table and team_member table with a QA-like role) are missing or unusable, then schedule an immediate abort of the remaining steps, marking the reason as 'not implemented functionality'. This step is conditional and should only be executed when Step 2 indicates missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["will_abort"]}
**Result:** Step 3 has been executed by analyzing the output from Step 2. The analysis shows that:

1. `has_implementation` is `True` - a suitable technical implementation exists
2. `implementation_entities` contains both required entities: `['project', 'team_member']`
3. `qa_role_values` contains the required QA role: `['QA']`

Since all conditions for a suitable implementation are met (has_implementation is true, required entities are present, and QA role values are identified), the task will **NOT** be aborted. The implementation is suitable for proceeding with the remaining steps of the task.

No state-changing functions were called - this step only involved inspecting the output from the previous step.

{
  "will_abort": false,
  "reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Resolve the current user ('Pieter van der Linden', internal id 'Bhwa_028') to an employee record in the employee table, to know which employee's projects to inspect.
Approach: Query the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028'. If not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on employee.name against 'Pieter van der Linden' (case-insensitive, allowing for typos, partial matches, and ordering differences). If multiple close matches are found, rank them by similarity and select the best one, documenting alternatives in candidate_matches. Do not access salary or other restricted fields; only use allowed fields such as id, name, email, location, and department.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"resolution_method":{"type":"string"},"candidate_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 4 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028' as instructed, which successfully returned the employee record.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used `who_am_i()` to get the current user context
   - I used `get_employee("Bhwa_028")` to retrieve the employee record by exact ID match
   - I verified the returned employee's name matched the expected name "Pieter van der Linden"
   - Since the exact ID match was successful, fuzzy matching was not needed (as per the approach: "If not found, use FUZZY...")

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `who_am_i()`: current_user = "Bhwa_028", location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands", department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - From `get_employee("Bhwa_028")`: 
     - id = "Bhwa_028"
     - name = "Pieter van der Linden" (exact match to expected name)
     - email = "Bhwa_028@bellini.internal"
     - location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"
     - department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - I only accessed allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as per company rules

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **No fuzzy matching was required** since the exact ID match was successful, so candidate_matches remains an empty array as instructed.

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_028",
  "found": true,
  "resolution_method": "exact_id_match",
  "candidate_matches": []
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure the current user is allowed to see their own projects and team compositions.
Approach: Use the bound identity of the current user (employee id from Step 4) and the company rules to perform a who_am_i-style authorization check. Confirm that the user is querying only their own projects ('my projects'), which should allow reading team_member and project data except for any restricted fields like salaries or confidential notes. Explicitly verify there is no requirement for special system roles to read this information. If the policy engine denies access, note the denial and stop further data-related steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"},"checked_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_view_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by performing a who_am_i-style authorization check and reviewing the company rules. I verified that the current user (Bhwa_028) is authenticated and there are no company rules restricting access to view their own projects and team compositions. The company rules only restrict mutation of project data (CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields, etc.) which require specific roles, but reading project data is permitted for authenticated users. I did not skip any actions - I explicitly checked the user context, authentication status, and reviewed all relevant company rules. All facts were verified from function returns: who_am_i() confirmed the user is authenticated, and get_employee() confirmed the user's identity matches Step 4 results. No state-changing functions were called during this step.

  "can_view_projects": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rules restrict reading one's own projects and team compositions. Rules only restrict mutation of project data, not reading.",
  "checked_roles": []
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 6: Retrieve all projects where the current user is a team member, representing 'my projects', without filtering on project status.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 (assuming permissions from Step 5 allow it), query the team_member table for all rows with team_member.employee_id equal to that id (exact match on id). Join these rows to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to get project names and identifiers. Because this lookup is by internal id, exact matching is preferred; fuzzy or semantic matching is not needed here. Collect a distinct list of all such projects across all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) without excluding any based on status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_count"]}

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 6 by retrieving all projects where the current user (Bhwa_028, Pieter van der Linden) is a team member. Using the `search_projects()` function with the `team_employee='Bhwa_028'` filter and including archived projects, I found exactly one project where the user is a team member.

The search was performed with pagination (limit=5 per request) and returned all results in a single batch. No fuzzy or semantic matching was needed since we used exact employee ID matching as specified in the approach.

All facts were verified from function returns:
- `who_am_i()` confirmed the current user is Bhwa_028
- `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)` returned exactly one project
- The project details were extracted and formatted as required

No state-changing functions were called during this step - only read operations were performed.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 6: Retrieve all projects where the current user is a team member, representing 'my projects', without filtering on project status.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 (assuming permissions from Step 5 allow it), query the team_member table for all rows with team_member.employee_id equal to that id (exact match on id). Join these rows to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to get project names and identifiers. Because this lookup is by internal id, exact matching is preferred; fuzzy or semantic matching is not needed here. Collect a distinct list of all such projects across all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) without excluding any based on status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_count"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have executed Step 6 according to the instructions and completed thorough verification. The step involved retrieving all projects where the current user (Bhwa_028) is a team member, representing 'my projects' without filtering on project status.

**Execution Summary:**
1. **Used exact employee ID matching**: I queried the `team_member` table indirectly via the `search_projects()` function with `team_employee='Bhwa_028'` as specified in the approach.
2. **Included all statuses**: Used `include_archived=True` to ensure no projects were filtered out based on status.
3. **Verified completeness**: I performed additional verification by:
   - Checking the full project details of the found project to confirm team membership
   - Sampling 15 projects (3 pages) from the entire project list and checking each for user membership
   - Searching for related projects to ensure no projects were missed due to query limitations
4. **Found exactly one project**: The user is a team member in only one project: `proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts` (Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade)
5. **No state-changing functions were called**: Only read operations were performed.

**Verification Details:**
- `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)` returned exactly one project
- `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")` confirmed the user's team membership: Role = Lead, Time slice = 0.4
- Sampled 15 projects from the project list: Only the same project contained the user as a team member
- No other projects with the user as team member were found in any verification checks

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions made.
