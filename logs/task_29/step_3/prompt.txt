Step 3: Abort the task if Step 2 determines that there is no suitable technical implementation to identify projects, team members, or a quality assurance responsibility role.
Approach: Inspect the output of Step 2. If has_implementation is false or the required entities (for example project table and team_member table with a QA-like role) are missing or unusable, then schedule an immediate abort of the remaining steps, marking the reason as 'not implemented functionality'. This step is conditional and should only be executed when Step 2 indicates missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["will_abort"]}
