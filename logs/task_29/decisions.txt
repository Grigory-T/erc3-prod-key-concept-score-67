DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:28:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 successfully determined the relevant team role label for QA responsibility as 'QA' within the project registry system, along with related role variants (e.g. 'QA Technician', 'Quality Engineer') but identified 'QA' as the key project team role label. This matches the plan's requirements. There is no ambiguity or lack of clarity preventing further progress in the plan. There are no missing capabilities or unexpected results that would require replanning. The next step (Step 2) is to identify the concrete technical implementation based on available schema and documentation, which logically follows from the output of Step 1.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:31:37
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan is fully on track. Steps 1 and 2 have been successfully completed with clear and relevant results. Step 2 confirms that the technical implementation supports the task exactly as planned (entity/table structure and role label 'QA' are clearly established). According to the original plan, Step 3 only triggers an abort if technical implementation is missing, which is not the case here. Therefore, we should proceed to the next step as the original plan intends.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:32:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps (1, 2, 3) have returned expected, relevant, and correct results strictly matching the original plan. There have been no errors or unexpected results. The technical and role mapping has been established, and there is direct support for fulfilling the task's next steps. There is no basis or requirement for replanning, aborting, or giving a final answer at this stage. Per the plan, we proceed to Step 4 next.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:34:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have been executed correctly and have returned the expected results, strictly according to the original plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing information. The entity and role mapping is clear, employee resolution is complete, and there are no authorization or technical obstacles identified. Therefore, the plan should continue with the next step, which is to check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee (Step 5). No need for replanning or early termination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:36:27
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All executed steps have produced expected and correct results strictly following the original plan. No missing information or inconsistencies. Steps 6 and 7 can be performed as originally planned and are needed to produce the definitive answer. There is no reason to abort or replan, and the final answer is not yet available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:39:23
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 6) fully matches the original plan and yields the expected output: a list of all projects where the current user is a team member. The next and final step (Step 7) is to check if any of these projects lack a member in the 'QA' role. All technical requirements and context from previous steps are clearly satisfied, and there are no unexpected errors or missing data. There is no reason to abort or replan; the plan is proceeding correctly. Therefore, the correct action is to continue to Step 7 as outlined in the original plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:42:01
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan have been completed and produced the expected, correct results at each checkpoint. Step 7, the final step, delivers a definitive answer to the original business question—listing the user's projects without QA responsibility covered. No steps remain, no information is missing, no discrepancies or risks have been discovered. Per plan, the final answer is ready and should be provided now.
