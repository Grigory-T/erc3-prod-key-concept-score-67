We are in Step 7. We have the following information from previous steps:

- Current user: Bhwa_028 (Pieter van der Linden)
- From Step 6: The user is a team member in exactly one project:
   project_id: "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts"
   project_name: "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade"

- From Step 2: The QA role value is exactly "QA".

Step 7 approach:
 For each project from Step 6, query the team_member table for that project_id and check if there is at least one team member with role matching the QA role value (exact match, and if ambiguity, use fuzzy). Since we have only one project and the QA role is exactly "QA", we can simply get the project details and check the team roles.

We must use the available function `get_project(project_id)` which returns a ProjectFull object containing the team list (list of TeamMember objects). Then we can check if any team member has role == "QA".

We do not need fuzzy matching because the role value is exactly "QA" and there is no ambiguity (from Step 2).

Let's proceed.

First, let's get the project details for the project from Step 6.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #24] 2025-12-09 20:40:46
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we need to output the projects without QA. From Step 6, we have only one project, and it doesn't have QA. So the list of projects without QA is just that one project. We need to output in the required JSON format.

But let's double-check: maybe there are more projects for the user? Step 6 said only one project, but let's verify again by searching all projects for team_employee='Bhwa_028' to ensure we didn't miss any.

Also, we should consider if there are any other role values that might indicate QA responsibility (like "Quality Engineer" as a role? But from Step 2, the QA role values are ["QA"]). However, we should also do fuzzy matching as per approach: "If there is ambiguity in role naming, additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison against the qa_role_values list to include those." Since we only have one QA role value "QA", and the roles in the team are "Lead", "Engineer", "Ops". None are close to "QA". So no fuzzy matching needed.

But to be thorough, let's search all projects for the user again and check each one.

First, let's get all projects for the user using search_projects with team_employee. Since there might be pagination, we should loop.

Also, we need to check if there are any projects where the user is a team member but maybe not captured in Step 6 due to pagination? Step 6 said total_count=1, but let's verify by listing all projects and checking membership manually? That might be overkill but we can do a quick check.

Let's write code to retrieve all projects where the user is a team member, then for each, check for QA role.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #25] 2025-12-09 20:41:02
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have successfully executed Step 7. The approach was:
1. Retrieved all projects where the user (Bhwa_028) is a team member (from Step 6, we already knew there was one project).
2. For each project, fetched the full project details to examine the team members.
3. Checked if any team member has a role that matches the QA role value(s) identified in Step 2 (which is exactly "QA").
4. Found that the single project (proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts) does not have any team member with the role "QA".

Therefore, the list of projects without a QA role is exactly that one project.

Now, we need to output the result in the required JSON format. Let's prepare the final answer.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #26] 2025-12-09 20:41:56
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are given the step description and expected output. We have already executed the code and printed the results.

 Let's verify the checklist:

 1. Did you execute the step instruction?
    - Yes, we followed the approach: for the project from Step 6 (only one project), we queried the team members and checked for QA role.

 2. Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
    - We did not skip any action. We:
        a. Retrieved the project from Step 6 (we only have one project).
        b. Fetched the full project details to get the team.
        c. Checked each team member's role against the QA role value(s) from Step 2 (only "QA").
        d. Collected the project without QA.

    We did not assume any data; we used the function returns.

 3. Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
    - We verified the project details by calling `get_project` and printed the team members.
    - The QA role value from Step 2 is exactly "QA", and we used exact matching.

 4. JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
    - The project ID and name were printed and verified.

 5. We did not use any make-up data.

 6. We did not need fuzzy matching because the role value is exact and unambiguous.

 7. We did not change any state (only read operations).

 8. We are sure about the results.

 However, note that the step says: "If there is ambiguity in role naming ... additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison". We did not do that because there was no ambiguity. The role values from Step 2 are exactly ["QA"] and the team roles we saw are exactly the standard ones (Lead, Engineer, Ops). We did not see any variation like "Q/A" or "QualityAssurance".

 But let's double-check by looking at the wiki again to see if there are any other variations of QA role that we might have missed in Step 2? Actually, Step 2 already did a fuzzy search and found only "QA". We trust that.

 However, to be thorough, let's check the team roles in the project we are examining. We saw: Lead, Engineer, Ops. None of these are "QA". But what if there is a role like "Quality Engineer" or "QA Technician" in the team? We only have the role field, which is a string. We saw exactly the strings: "Lead", "Engineer", "Ops". So no.

 But wait, the qa_role_values from Step 2 included "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" as job titles. However, in the project team, the role field is not a job title but a project role. The documentation from Step 1 and Step 2 clarified that the project role is one of: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other. So we are only looking for the string "QA" in the role field.

 We did exactly that.

 However, the step says: "If there is ambiguity in role naming (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison against the qa_role_values list to include those."

 Since we are only checking for the string "QA", and we don't have any variation in our data, we are safe.

 But let's consider: what if the team member has a role "Quality Engineer" (which is a job title) but in the project team, the role field is "Engineer"? Then that person might be responsible for quality assurance but not have the role "QA". However, the step says: "role matches any of the QA-responsible role values identified in Step 2". Step 2 gave us ["QA"] for the project role. The other values ("QA Technician", "Quality Engineer", "Quality & HSE Manager") are job titles, not project roles. So we are correct.

 We can double-check by looking at the employee records of the team members to see if any of them have a job title related to QA? But the step does not require that. It says: "team member whose role matches ...". The role is the project role, not the job title.

 So we are following the step correctly.

 Given the above, we are confident in our result.

 However, let's do one more check: we have only one project. What if there are more projects for the user that we missed? We already retrieved all projects with team_employee='Bhwa_028' and got one. But let's double-check by looking at all projects and checking if the user is a team member in any other project.

 We can do a more exhaustive search by listing all projects and checking the team for each, but that might be heavy. Alternatively, we can use the `search_projects` function with the team_employee filter, which we already did and it returned one project.

 We also did a manual sample of 15 projects in Step 6 and found only one. So it's safe.

 Let's run a quick check: get all projects and for each, check if the user is in the team. But we already did that in Step 6.

 We'll do one more quick check: use `list_all_projects` and then for each project, get the full project and check if the user is in the team. But note: `list_all_projects` returns a list of ProjectBrief, which doesn't include the team. We would have to call `get_project` for each, which is 15 projects (from Step 6 we know there are 15 projects total). We can do that to be absolutely sure.

 However, the step says: "For each project obtained in Step 6". We already have the list from Step 6. We are using that.

 We are confident.

 Let's output the same JSON as before, but note that we have already printed the result.

 We'll now produce the final answer and JSON.
