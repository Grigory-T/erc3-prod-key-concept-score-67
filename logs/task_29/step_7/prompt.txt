Step 7: Determine which of the user's projects do not have any team member responsible for quality assurance, and return that list.
Approach: For each project obtained in Step 6, query the team_member table for that project_id and check whether there exists at least one team member whose role matches any of the QA-responsible role values identified in Step 2 (for example role = 'QA'), using exact matching on role first. If there is ambiguity in role naming (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison against the qa_role_values list to include those. A project is considered to have 'somebody responsible for quality assurance' if at least one such team_member row exists. Collect all projects from Step 6 where no such team_member exists and output them as the result.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_without_qa":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_without_qa":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects_without_qa","total_without_qa"]}
