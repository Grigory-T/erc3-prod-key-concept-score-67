I have executed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the company wiki documentation. The analysis reveals that "quality assurance" (QA) in the company context maps to specific role labels used in project teams and job titles. The most relevant finding is that in project teams, "QA" is one of the standard role labels in the project registry system alongside Lead, Engineer, Designer, Ops, and Other. Additionally, there are job titles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department. No explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term were found in the wiki, but the role conventions are clearly established in the project registry documentation.

For project team composition and responsibility for quality assurance, the role label 'QA' in the project registry is the relevant mapping."],
