We are at Step 1: Understand what 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' mean in the company context.

 We need to search the internal wiki for terms related to 'quality assurance', 'QA', etc., and interpret possible abbreviations or slang.

 Approach:
 1. Use the `list_wiki()` function to get all wiki file paths.
 2. For each wiki file, we can load the content and search for relevant terms. However, we also have a `search_wiki_fuzzy` function that can fuzzy search for words in the wiki.
 3. We'll use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of target words: ['quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', 'project team roles', 'quality assurance engineer', 'QA engineer', 'quality assurance role', 'QA role'].
 4. We can also use `search_wiki` with a regex pattern, but note that the fuzzy function is more flexible.

 However, note that the `search_wiki_fuzzy` function takes a list of words and returns matches for each word. We'll use a list of words that are relevant.

 But note: the step says to use fuzzy and semantic/logical matching. The fuzzy function does fuzzy matching on words. We'll also consider that the wiki might have abbreviations.

 Let's break down:

 Steps in code:

 1. Get the list of wiki files to know what we have (optional, but we can print for context).
 2. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of words that we think are relevant.
 3. From the results, we can extract the context and see how QA is used.
 4. We'll look for any definitions or role labels in the wiki.

 However, note that the expected output requires:
   - qa_term_definitions: array of strings (definitions found)
   - qa_role_labels: array of strings (role labels, e.g., 'QA', 'Quality Assurance Engineer')
   - ambiguity_notes: array of strings (any notes about ambiguity)
   - source_paths: array of strings (the wiki file paths that were used)

 We are only reading documentation.

 We'll do:

   words = ['quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', 'project team roles', 'quality assurance engineer', 'QA engineer', 'quality assurance role', 'QA role', 'quality', 'assurance']

 But note: the fuzzy function might split the words? The function `search_wiki_fuzzy` expects a list of words. We can try with multiple words by splitting, but the function does fuzzy matching on the entire word string? Actually, the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` does fuzzy matching for each word in the list against the wiki content. So we can pass a list of terms (each term can be a multi-word string). However, the function is called with `words` parameter, and it does fuzzy matching for each word. We'll pass the list as above.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll also use `search_wiki` with a regex pattern to find any exact matches for 'QA' or 'quality assurance' in the wiki.

 But note: the step says to use fuzzy and semantic matching. We'll rely on `search_wiki_fuzzy` for fuzzy, and then we can also use `search_wiki` for regex to get more context.

 However, the `search_wiki` function uses regex, so we can search for patterns like 'quality.*assurance' or 'QA'.

 We'll do both.

 Steps:

 1. List all wiki files (optional, but we can see the structure).
 2. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the list of words.
 3. Use `search_wiki` with a regex pattern that catches variations (e.g., 'quality assurance', 'QA').

 But note: the `search_wiki` function returns lines that match the regex. We can use it to get more context.

 However, we are only allowed to use the available functions.

 Let's code accordingly.

 We'll collect:

   - definitions: if we find any line that defines QA or quality assurance.
   - role labels: if we find any line that mentions a role for QA (e.g., role = 'QA', or 'QA Engineer').

 We'll interpret the results and then format as expected.

 Since we are only reading, we can do multiple searches.

 We'll start by getting the wiki files and then search.

 Let's code:

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 20:26:42
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have searched the wiki and found several relevant pieces of information. Now we need to interpret the results to understand what "quality assurance" (QA) means in the company context and how it maps to team roles.

From the search results, we can see:

1. In the project registry documentation (`systems/project_registry.md`), the allowed project roles are listed as: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other. This indicates that "QA" is a distinct role that can be assigned to a team member in a project.

2. There are also references to "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" as job titles in the `hr/people_and_rules.md` and `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` files. For example, Ana Petrović is a "Quality Engineer – Serbia" and there is a "QA Technician" role in the Quality & HSE department.

3. The term "quality assurance" appears in the context of production and quality systems, but for project teams, the role is explicitly labeled as "QA".

4. There is no indication that "somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team" means anything other than having a team member with the role "QA". However, note that a "Quality Engineer" might also be assigned to a project with a role other than "QA" (e.g., as an "Engineer"). But the project role system has a specific "QA" role.

5. The ambiguity note found doesn't relate to QA roles, so we can ignore it for this purpose.

Thus, we can conclude:

- QA in the company context refers to the project role "QA", which is one of the standard roles (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other) in the project registry.
- Additionally, there are job titles such as "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department, but for project team assignment, the role field is used and we are looking for the value "QA".

Therefore, for the purpose of the task (which projects don't have a QA role assigned), we will look for projects where no team member has the role "QA".

Now, we need to output the findings in the required JSON format.

The expected output is:
{
  "qa_term_definitions": [ ... ],  // array of strings defining QA
  "qa_role_labels": [ ... ],       // array of strings for role labels (like "QA", "Quality Engineer", etc.)
  "ambiguity_notes": [ ... ],      // array of strings noting any ambiguities
  "source_paths": [ ... ]          // array of strings for source wiki file paths
}

We have:
- qa_term_definitions: We didn't find explicit definitions, but we can note that QA stands for Quality Assurance and is a project role. However, the search didn't yield a definition string. We might leave this empty or note what we inferred.

But let's be precise: we are to output definitions found. We didn't find a definition per se, but we can extract from context. However, the instructions say to output only what we found. We found that "QA" is a project role and that there are quality assurance related job titles. 

Alternatively, we can note that in the project registry, the role "QA" is one of the standard roles. We can also note that the company has a Quality & HSE department with roles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer".

Given the search results, let's collect:

- From `systems/project_registry.md`: "Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)" -> This indicates that "QA" is a project role.
- From `hr/people_and_roles.md`: "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" are listed under Quality & HSE.
- From `hr/example_employee_profiles.md`: Example of a "Quality Engineer".

We can use these to populate the arrays.

For qa_term_definitions, we might not have found an explicit definition, but we can note the context. However, the output expects an array of strings. Let's see if any of the context strings can serve as a definition. We have:

- "Formal QA and HSE practices are introduced." (from history.md) but that doesn't define QA.

We might not have a definition, so we can leave it empty or note the role. Since the step is about understanding the term, and we found that it is a project role, we can state that.

But to be safe, let's output an empty array for qa_term_definitions because we didn't find a definition in the wiki. Alternatively, we can include the string that mentions the project role.

Given the instructions, I think we should output what we found: the project role and the job titles.

Let's structure:

qa_term_definitions: []  (we didn't find a formal definition)
qa_role_labels: ["QA", "QA Technician", "Quality Engineer"]  (from the project role and job titles)
ambiguity_notes: []  (we didn't find any ambiguities, the one found was about something else)
source_paths: list of relevant wiki files

We have many source paths, but we should only include the ones that are relevant to QA and project roles. From the summary, the relevant files are:
- systems/project_registry.md (for project role QA)
- hr/people_and_roles.md (for job titles)
- hr/example_employee_profiles.md (for example of Quality Engineer)

Also, company/history.md mentions QA but not in the project context, so we might not include it.

Let's be selective and include only the most relevant.

Now, let's prepare the JSON.

[REASONING #3] 2025-12-09 20:27:59
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to verify the results. The step asked for understanding 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' meaning in the company context.
We performed fuzzy and semantic search on wiki. We found:
- In project registry, the roles include: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other. So "QA" is a specific role label for project team members.
- We also found job titles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department.
- However, the step asks for mapping to a specific team member role label. The project registry explicitly lists "QA" as a role.
- We also found ambiguity: QA can refer to both a project role and a job title/departmental function.
- We did not find explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term in definitions. The qa_term_definitions array is empty because we didn't find explicit definitions like "Quality assurance means...". However, we might have missed some definitions. Let's double-check by loading the specific wiki files that might contain definitions.

We should load the relevant wiki files to see if there are explicit definitions. The source_paths we identified include: systems/project_registry.md, hr/people_and_roles.md, hr/example_employee_profiles.md, operations/factories_and_production.md, company/history.md.

Let's load these files and search for explicit definitions of quality assurance.

We'll write code to load these files and look for definitions. We'll also check for any other conventions like "QA responsible" or "QA owner".

We should also consider that the step asked for semantic matching: interpret possible abbreviations or slang. We found that "QA" is used as an abbreviation for quality assurance in the project role.

But to be thorough, let's load the files and extract relevant sections. We'll also check if there is any documentation about project team roles and responsibilities.

We'll write a new code block to examine these files more closely.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #4] 2025-12-09 20:28:23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have completed the step. The search revealed:
- No explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term in the wiki.
- Several role labels related to QA: "QA" as a project role, and job titles like "QA Technician", "Quality Engineer", and "Quality & HSE Manager".
- The project registry system uses a fixed set of role labels for team members: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other.
- There is no explicit mention of "somebody responsible for quality assurance" as a phrase, but the role "QA" in the project team is the designated role for quality assurance on a project.

We note that there are multiple contexts: 
1. Project team role: "QA" is one of the standard roles in a project team (from systems/project_registry.md).
2. Job titles in the Quality & HSE department: "QA Technician", "Quality Engineer", "Quality & HSE Manager" (from hr/people_and_roles.md).

For the purpose of the task (identifying projects without QA responsible), the relevant mapping is the project team role "QA". 

We have not found any explicit definition of "quality assurance" as a term, so the definitions array remains empty.

The source paths are the wiki files we examined: systems/project_registry.md and hr/people_and_roles.md.

Now we can produce the final answer.
