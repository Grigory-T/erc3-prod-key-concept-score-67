Step 1: Understand what 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' mean in the company context, including whether this maps to a specific team member role label (for example role = 'QA') or any other convention.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file table and any other available company documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching for terms and abbreviations related to 'quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', and 'project team roles'. Interpret possible abbreviations or slang (for example 'QA' vs 'quality assurance engineer') using semantic similarity. If multiple meanings are found, identify which specifically relate to project teams and responsibility for quality assurance. This step only reads documentation; it does not access or modify any project or employee data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"qa_term_definitions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["qa_term_definitions","qa_role_labels","source_paths"]}
