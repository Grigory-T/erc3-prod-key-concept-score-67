## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand what 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' mean in the company context, including whether this maps to a specific team member role label (for example role = 'QA') or any other convention.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file table and any other available company documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching for terms and abbreviations related to 'quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', and 'project team roles'. Interpret possible abbreviations or slang (for example 'QA' vs 'quality assurance engineer') using semantic similarity. If multiple meanings are found, identify which specifically relate to project teams and responsibility for quality assurance. This step only reads documentation; it does not access or modify any project or employee data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"qa_term_definitions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["qa_term_definitions","qa_role_labels","source_paths"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the company wiki documentation. The analysis reveals that "quality assurance" (QA) in the company context maps to specific role labels used in project teams and job titles. The most relevant finding is that in project teams, "QA" is one of the standard role labels in the project registry system alongside Lead, Engineer, Designer, Ops, and Other. Additionally, there are job titles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department. No explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term were found in the wiki, but the role conventions are clearly established in the project registry documentation.

{
  "qa_term_definitions": [],
  "qa_role_labels": ["QA", "QA Technician", "Quality Engineer", "Quality & HSE Manager"],
  "ambiguity_notes": ["The term 'QA' appears in two distinct contexts: 1) As a project team role label ('QA') in the project registry system, which is one of the standard roles (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other) assigned to team members. 2) As job titles in the Quality & HSE department (QA Technician, Quality Engineer, Quality & HSE Manager). For project team composition and responsibility for quality assurance, the role label 'QA' in the project registry is the relevant mapping."],
  "source_paths": ["systems/project_registry.md", "hr/people_and_roles.md"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, fields, or services) that represent projects, project team membership, and the role responsible for quality assurance.
Approach: Based on the schema and any technical documentation, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over available technical descriptions for entities like 'project', 'team member', 'role', and 'QA'. Confirm which tables and fields to use: for example, project for projects and team_member for membership with role values, and determine which role value(s) (for example 'QA') correspond to someone responsible for quality assurance, using the results from Step 1. If there are naming variations or typos in documentation (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), use fuzzy matching and partial matching to interpret them.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"implementation_entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["has_implementation","implementation_entities","qa_role_values"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by thoroughly searching the technical documentation. Let me verify and consolidate my findings:

**Execution Details:**
1. I searched the available wiki files for technical documentation about project implementation, team membership, and QA roles.
2. I examined the project registry documentation in detail (systems/project_registry.md) which explicitly defines:
   - Projects have a "team" field containing a list of team members
   - Each team member has: assigned employee, role, and time slice (fraction of FTE)
   - The role values are explicitly listed as: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other
3. I verified there are no other technical database tables, fields, or services mentioned in the available documentation beyond what's in the project registry.
4. I confirmed through fuzzy search that "QA" is the exact role value (not "Q/A", "QualityAssurance", or other variations).

**Verified Facts (from function returns):**
1. From `list_wiki()`: We have documentation files including "systems/project_registry.md"
2. From `load_wiki("systems/project_registry.md")`: Lines 34-36 and 67 explicitly state:
   - "Team and workloads:" 
   - "Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)"
   - "Role – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)"
3. From `search_wiki()` and `search_wiki_fuzzy()`: No other variations of QA role values were found in the technical documentation.
4. The available API functions (`get_project()`, `ProjectFull`, `TeamMember`) confirm this implementation structure matches the documentation.

**No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations on documentation.

**Conclusion:** The technical implementation uses the "project" entity with a "team" field containing "team_member" objects, and the QA role value is exactly "QA".

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "implementation_entities": ["project", "team_member"],
  "qa_role_values": ["QA"],
  "notes": "The project registry system defines projects with a 'team' field containing a list of team members. Each team member has: employee (ID), role (string), and time_slice (float). The role value for quality assurance responsibility is exactly 'QA' as documented in systems/project_registry.md lines 36 and 67. No other variations or alternative spellings were found in the technical documentation."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Abort the task if Step 2 determines that there is no suitable technical implementation to identify projects, team members, or a quality assurance responsibility role.
Approach: Inspect the output of Step 2. If has_implementation is false or the required entities (for example project table and team_member table with a QA-like role) are missing or unusable, then schedule an immediate abort of the remaining steps, marking the reason as 'not implemented functionality'. This step is conditional and should only be executed when Step 2 indicates missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["will_abort"]}
**Result:** Step 3 has been executed by analyzing the output from Step 2. The analysis shows that:

1. `has_implementation` is `True` - a suitable technical implementation exists
2. `implementation_entities` contains both required entities: `['project', 'team_member']`
3. `qa_role_values` contains the required QA role: `['QA']`

Since all conditions for a suitable implementation are met (has_implementation is true, required entities are present, and QA role values are identified), the task will **NOT** be aborted. The implementation is suitable for proceeding with the remaining steps of the task.

No state-changing functions were called - this step only involved inspecting the output from the previous step.

{
  "will_abort": false,
  "reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Resolve the current user ('Pieter van der Linden', internal id 'Bhwa_028') to an employee record in the employee table, to know which employee's projects to inspect.
Approach: Query the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028'. If not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on employee.name against 'Pieter van der Linden' (case-insensitive, allowing for typos, partial matches, and ordering differences). If multiple close matches are found, rank them by similarity and select the best one, documenting alternatives in candidate_matches. Do not access salary or other restricted fields; only use allowed fields such as id, name, email, location, and department.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"resolution_method":{"type":"string"},"candidate_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 4 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028' as instructed, which successfully returned the employee record.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used `who_am_i()` to get the current user context
   - I used `get_employee("Bhwa_028")` to retrieve the employee record by exact ID match
   - I verified the returned employee's name matched the expected name "Pieter van der Linden"
   - Since the exact ID match was successful, fuzzy matching was not needed (as per the approach: "If not found, use FUZZY...")

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `who_am_i()`: current_user = "Bhwa_028", location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands", department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - From `get_employee("Bhwa_028")`: 
     - id = "Bhwa_028"
     - name = "Pieter van der Linden" (exact match to expected name)
     - email = "Bhwa_028@bellini.internal"
     - location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"
     - department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - I only accessed allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as per company rules

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **No fuzzy matching was required** since the exact ID match was successful, so candidate_matches remains an empty array as instructed.

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_028",
  "found": true,
  "resolution_method": "exact_id_match",
  "candidate_matches": []
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure the current user is allowed to see their own projects and team compositions.
Approach: Use the bound identity of the current user (employee id from Step 4) and the company rules to perform a who_am_i-style authorization check. Confirm that the user is querying only their own projects ('my projects'), which should allow reading team_member and project data except for any restricted fields like salaries or confidential notes. Explicitly verify there is no requirement for special system roles to read this information. If the policy engine denies access, note the denial and stop further data-related steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"},"checked_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_view_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by performing a who_am_i-style authorization check and reviewing the company rules. I verified that the current user (Bhwa_028) is authenticated and there are no company rules restricting access to view their own projects and team compositions. The company rules only restrict mutation of project data (CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields, etc.) which require specific roles, but reading project data is permitted for authenticated users. I did not skip any actions - I explicitly checked the user context, authentication status, and reviewed all relevant company rules. All facts were verified from function returns: who_am_i() confirmed the user is authenticated, and get_employee() confirmed the user's identity matches Step 4 results. No state-changing functions were called during this step.

{
  "can_view_projects": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rules restrict reading one's own projects and team compositions. Rules only restrict mutation of project data, not reading.",
  "checked_roles": []
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Retrieve all projects where the current user is a team member, representing 'my projects', without filtering on project status.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 (assuming permissions from Step 5 allow it), query the team_member table for all rows with team_member.employee_id equal to that id (exact match on id). Join these rows to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to get project names and identifiers. Because this lookup is by internal id, exact matching is preferred; fuzzy or semantic matching is not needed here. Collect a distinct list of all such projects across all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) without excluding any based on status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_count"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 6 according to the instructions and completed thorough verification. The step involved retrieving all projects where the current user (Bhwa_028) is a team member, representing 'my projects' without filtering on project status.

**Execution Summary:**
1. **Used exact employee ID matching**: I queried the `team_member` table indirectly via the `search_projects()` function with `team_employee='Bhwa_028'` as specified in the approach.
2. **Included all statuses**: Used `include_archived=True` to ensure no projects were filtered out based on status.
3. **Verified completeness**: I performed additional verification by:
   - Checking the full project details of the found project to confirm team membership
   - Sampling 15 projects (3 pages) from the entire project list and checking each for user membership
   - Searching for related projects to ensure no projects were missed due to query limitations
4. **Found exactly one project**: The user is a team member in only one project: `proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts` (Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade)
5. **No state-changing functions were called**: Only read operations were performed.

**Verification Details:**
- `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)` returned exactly one project
- `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")` confirmed the user's team membership: Role = Lead, Time slice = 0.4
- Sampled 15 projects from the project list: Only the same project contained the user as a team member
- No other projects with the user as team member were found in any verification checks

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions made.

{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts",
      "project_name": "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}

### Step 7
Step 7: Determine which of the user's projects do not have any team member responsible for quality assurance, and return that list.
Approach: For each project obtained in Step 6, query the team_member table for that project_id and check whether there exists at least one team member whose role matches any of the QA-responsible role values identified in Step 2 (for example role = 'QA'), using exact matching on role first. If there is ambiguity in role naming (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison against the qa_role_values list to include those. A project is considered to have 'somebody responsible for quality assurance' if at least one such team_member row exists. Collect all projects from Step 6 where no such team_member exists and output them as the result.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_without_qa":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_without_qa":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects_without_qa","total_without_qa"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 7 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I followed the exact approach described:
   - Retrieved all projects where the user is a team member from Step 6
   - For each project, queried the team members using `get_project()`
   - Checked if any team member's role matches the QA-responsible role value "QA" (exact matching as identified in Step 2)
   - Collected projects without any QA team member

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I retrieved the project details for "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts"
   - I examined all 3 team members' roles: "Lead", "Engineer", and "Ops"
   - I verified none matched "QA"
   - I did not need fuzzy/semantic matching since the role values were exact and unambiguous
   - I confirmed through exhaustive search that the user is only in one project

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)`: Only one project found
   - From `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")`: Team members and roles explicitly returned and printed
   - The QA role value "QA" was confirmed from Step 2 results
   - No other role variations found that would require fuzzy matching

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **All data comes from function returns**:
   - Project ID and name from `get_project()` return
   - Team member roles from `project.team` attribute
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used

The verification confirms the user has only one project, and that project does not have any team member with the "QA" role, meaning it lacks somebody responsible for quality assurance.

No additional actions are needed.

Which of my projects doesn't have somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team?

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand what 'quality assurance' (QA) and 'somebody responsible for the quality assurance on the team' mean in the company context, including whether this maps to a specific team member role label (for example role = 'QA') or any other convention.
Approach: Search the internal wiki_file table and any other available company documentation using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching for terms and abbreviations related to 'quality assurance', 'QA', 'QA responsible', 'QA owner', and 'project team roles'. Interpret possible abbreviations or slang (for example 'QA' vs 'quality assurance engineer') using semantic similarity. If multiple meanings are found, identify which specifically relate to project teams and responsibility for quality assurance. This step only reads documentation; it does not access or modify any project or employee data.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"qa_term_definitions":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_labels":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"ambiguity_notes":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"source_paths":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["qa_term_definitions","qa_role_labels","source_paths"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 by thoroughly searching the company wiki documentation. The analysis reveals that "quality assurance" (QA) in the company context maps to specific role labels used in project teams and job titles. The most relevant finding is that in project teams, "QA" is one of the standard role labels in the project registry system alongside Lead, Engineer, Designer, Ops, and Other. Additionally, there are job titles like "QA Technician" and "Quality Engineer" in the Quality & HSE department. No explicit definitions of "quality assurance" as a term were found in the wiki, but the role conventions are clearly established in the project registry documentation.

  "source_paths": ["systems/project_registry.md", "hr/people_and_roles.md"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, fields, or services) that represent projects, project team membership, and the role responsible for quality assurance.
Approach: Based on the schema and any technical documentation, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over available technical descriptions for entities like 'project', 'team member', 'role', and 'QA'. Confirm which tables and fields to use: for example, project for projects and team_member for membership with role values, and determine which role value(s) (for example 'QA') correspond to someone responsible for quality assurance, using the results from Step 1. If there are naming variations or typos in documentation (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), use fuzzy matching and partial matching to interpret them.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"implementation_entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["has_implementation","implementation_entities","qa_role_values"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 2 by thoroughly searching the technical documentation. Let me verify and consolidate my findings:

**Execution Details:**
1. I searched the available wiki files for technical documentation about project implementation, team membership, and QA roles.
2. I examined the project registry documentation in detail (systems/project_registry.md) which explicitly defines:
   - Projects have a "team" field containing a list of team members
   - Each team member has: assigned employee, role, and time slice (fraction of FTE)
   - The role values are explicitly listed as: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other
3. I verified there are no other technical database tables, fields, or services mentioned in the available documentation beyond what's in the project registry.
4. I confirmed through fuzzy search that "QA" is the exact role value (not "Q/A", "QualityAssurance", or other variations).

**Verified Facts (from function returns):**
1. From `list_wiki()`: We have documentation files including "systems/project_registry.md"
2. From `load_wiki("systems/project_registry.md")`: Lines 34-36 and 67 explicitly state:
   - "Team and workloads:" 
   - "Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)"
   - "Role – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)"
3. From `search_wiki()` and `search_wiki_fuzzy()`: No other variations of QA role values were found in the technical documentation.
4. The available API functions (`get_project()`, `ProjectFull`, `TeamMember`) confirm this implementation structure matches the documentation.

**No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations on documentation.

**Conclusion:** The technical implementation uses the "project" entity with a "team" field containing "team_member" objects, and the QA role value is exactly "QA".

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "implementation_entities": ["project", "team_member"],
  "qa_role_values": ["QA"],
  "notes": "The project registry system defines projects with a 'team' field containing a list of team members. Each team member has: employee (ID), role (string), and time_slice (float). The role value for quality assurance responsibility is exactly 'QA' as documented in systems/project_registry.md lines 36 and 67. No other variations or alternative spellings were found in the technical documentation."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Abort the task if Step 2 determines that there is no suitable technical implementation to identify projects, team members, or a quality assurance responsibility role.
Approach: Inspect the output of Step 2. If has_implementation is false or the required entities (for example project table and team_member table with a QA-like role) are missing or unusable, then schedule an immediate abort of the remaining steps, marking the reason as 'not implemented functionality'. This step is conditional and should only be executed when Step 2 indicates missing implementation.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"will_abort":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["will_abort"]}
**Result:** Step 3 has been executed by analyzing the output from Step 2. The analysis shows that:

1. `has_implementation` is `True` - a suitable technical implementation exists
2. `implementation_entities` contains both required entities: `['project', 'team_member']`
3. `qa_role_values` contains the required QA role: `['QA']`

Since all conditions for a suitable implementation are met (has_implementation is true, required entities are present, and QA role values are identified), the task will **NOT** be aborted. The implementation is suitable for proceeding with the remaining steps of the task.

No state-changing functions were called - this step only involved inspecting the output from the previous step.

{
  "will_abort": false,
  "reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Resolve the current user ('Pieter van der Linden', internal id 'Bhwa_028') to an employee record in the employee table, to know which employee's projects to inspect.
Approach: Query the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028'. If not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on employee.name against 'Pieter van der Linden' (case-insensitive, allowing for typos, partial matches, and ordering differences). If multiple close matches are found, rank them by similarity and select the best one, documenting alternatives in candidate_matches. Do not access salary or other restricted fields; only use allowed fields such as id, name, email, location, and department.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"resolution_method":{"type":"string"},"candidate_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 4 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028' as instructed, which successfully returned the employee record.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used `who_am_i()` to get the current user context
   - I used `get_employee("Bhwa_028")` to retrieve the employee record by exact ID match
   - I verified the returned employee's name matched the expected name "Pieter van der Linden"
   - Since the exact ID match was successful, fuzzy matching was not needed (as per the approach: "If not found, use FUZZY...")

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `who_am_i()`: current_user = "Bhwa_028", location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands", department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - From `get_employee("Bhwa_028")`: 
     - id = "Bhwa_028"
     - name = "Pieter van der Linden" (exact match to expected name)
     - email = "Bhwa_028@bellini.internal"
     - location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"
     - department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - I only accessed allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as per company rules

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **No fuzzy matching was required** since the exact ID match was successful, so candidate_matches remains an empty array as instructed.

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.

{
  "employee_id": "Bhwa_028",
  "found": true,
  "resolution_method": "exact_id_match",
  "candidate_matches": []
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure the current user is allowed to see their own projects and team compositions.
Approach: Use the bound identity of the current user (employee id from Step 4) and the company rules to perform a who_am_i-style authorization check. Confirm that the user is querying only their own projects ('my projects'), which should allow reading team_member and project data except for any restricted fields like salaries or confidential notes. Explicitly verify there is no requirement for special system roles to read this information. If the policy engine denies access, note the denial and stop further data-related steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"},"checked_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["can_view_projects"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction by performing a who_am_i-style authorization check and reviewing the company rules. I verified that the current user (Bhwa_028) is authenticated and there are no company rules restricting access to view their own projects and team compositions. The company rules only restrict mutation of project data (CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields, etc.) which require specific roles, but reading project data is permitted for authenticated users. I did not skip any actions - I explicitly checked the user context, authentication status, and reviewed all relevant company rules. All facts were verified from function returns: who_am_i() confirmed the user is authenticated, and get_employee() confirmed the user's identity matches Step 4 results. No state-changing functions were called during this step.

{
  "can_view_projects": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and no company rules restrict reading one's own projects and team compositions. Rules only restrict mutation of project data, not reading.",
  "checked_roles": []
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Retrieve all projects where the current user is a team member, representing 'my projects', without filtering on project status.
Approach: Using the employee_id from Step 4 (assuming permissions from Step 5 allow it), query the team_member table for all rows with team_member.employee_id equal to that id (exact match on id). Join these rows to the project table on project.id = team_member.project_id to get project names and identifiers. Because this lookup is by internal id, exact matching is preferred; fuzzy or semantic matching is not needed here. Collect a distinct list of all such projects across all statuses (idea, exploring, active, paused, archived) without excluding any based on status.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_count"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 6 according to the instructions and completed thorough verification. The step involved retrieving all projects where the current user (Bhwa_028) is a team member, representing 'my projects' without filtering on project status.

**Execution Summary:**
1. **Used exact employee ID matching**: I queried the `team_member` table indirectly via the `search_projects()` function with `team_employee='Bhwa_028'` as specified in the approach.
2. **Included all statuses**: Used `include_archived=True` to ensure no projects were filtered out based on status.
3. **Verified completeness**: I performed additional verification by:
   - Checking the full project details of the found project to confirm team membership
   - Sampling 15 projects (3 pages) from the entire project list and checking each for user membership
   - Searching for related projects to ensure no projects were missed due to query limitations
4. **Found exactly one project**: The user is a team member in only one project: `proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts` (Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade)
5. **No state-changing functions were called**: Only read operations were performed.

**Verification Details:**
- `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)` returned exactly one project
- `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")` confirmed the user's team membership: Role = Lead, Time slice = 0.4
- Sampled 15 projects from the project list: Only the same project contained the user as a team member
- No other projects with the user as team member were found in any verification checks

All facts were explicitly verified from function returns with no assumptions made.

{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts",
      "project_name": "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade"
    }
  ],
  "total_count": 1
}

### Step 7
Step 7: Determine which of the user's projects do not have any team member responsible for quality assurance, and return that list.
Approach: For each project obtained in Step 6, query the team_member table for that project_id and check whether there exists at least one team member whose role matches any of the QA-responsible role values identified in Step 2 (for example role = 'QA'), using exact matching on role first. If there is ambiguity in role naming (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), additionally use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL comparison against the qa_role_values list to include those. A project is considered to have 'somebody responsible for quality assurance' if at least one such team_member row exists. Collect all projects from Step 6 where no such team_member exists and output them as the result.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects_without_qa":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_id","project_name"]}},"total_without_qa":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects_without_qa","total_without_qa"]}
**Result:** I have verified that Step 7 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I followed the exact approach described:
   - Retrieved all projects where the user is a team member from Step 6
   - For each project, queried the team members using `get_project()`
   - Checked if any team member's role matches the QA-responsible role value "QA" (exact matching as identified in Step 2)
   - Collected projects without any QA team member

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I retrieved the project details for "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts"
   - I examined all 3 team members' roles: "Lead", "Engineer", and "Ops"
   - I verified none matched "QA"
   - I did not need fuzzy/semantic matching since the role values were exact and unambiguous
   - I confirmed through exhaustive search that the user is only in one project

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `search_projects(team_employee='Bhwa_028', include_archived=True)`: Only one project found
   - From `get_project("proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts")`: Team members and roles explicitly returned and printed
   - The QA role value "QA" was confirmed from Step 2 results
   - No other role variations found that would require fuzzy matching

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **All data comes from function returns**:
   - Project ID and name from `get_project()` return
   - Team member roles from `project.team` attribute
   - No made-up data or sensible defaults used

The verification confirms the user has only one project, and that project does not have any team member with the "QA" role, meaning it lacks somebody responsible for quality assurance.

No additional actions are needed.

{
  "projects_without_qa": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts",
      "project_name": "Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade"
    }
  ],
  "total_without_qa": 1
}

### Final Result
You are currently a team member on one project: 'Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade' (project ID: proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts). This project does not have anyone assigned the 'QA' (quality assurance) role in the project team, meaning it lacks somebody responsible for quality assurance. No other projects were found for you, and therefore no other cases exist.

Summary: Of your projects, the following do not have someone responsible for quality assurance:
- Signal mast & infrastructure coating upgrade (proj_ferro_rail_infra_masts)

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

User details: {"id": "Bhwa_028", "name": "Pieter van der Linden", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "Rotterdam Office \u2013 Netherlands"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
