STEP 4 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 20:34:09

I have verified that Step 4 was executed completely according to the instructions and checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028' as instructed, which successfully returned the employee record.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - I used `who_am_i()` to get the current user context
   - I used `get_employee("Bhwa_028")` to retrieve the employee record by exact ID match
   - I verified the returned employee's name matched the expected name "Pieter van der Linden"
   - Since the exact ID match was successful, fuzzy matching was not needed (as per the approach: "If not found, use FUZZY...")

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - From `who_am_i()`: current_user = "Bhwa_028", location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands", department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - From `get_employee("Bhwa_028")`: 
     - id = "Bhwa_028"
     - name = "Pieter van der Linden" (exact match to expected name)
     - email = "Bhwa_028@bellini.internal"
     - location = "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands"
     - department = "Sales & Customer Success"
   - I only accessed allowed fields (id, name, email, location, department) as per company rules

4. **No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations.

5. **No fuzzy matching was required** since the exact ID match was successful, so candidate_matches remains an empty array as instructed.

The execution fully complies with the step requirements and company rules.
