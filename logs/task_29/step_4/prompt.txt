Step 4: Resolve the current user ('Pieter van der Linden', internal id 'Bhwa_028') to an employee record in the employee table, to know which employee's projects to inspect.
Approach: Query the employee table first by exact match on id = 'Bhwa_028'. If not found, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on employee.name against 'Pieter van der Linden' (case-insensitive, allowing for typos, partial matches, and ordering differences). If multiple close matches are found, rank them by similarity and select the best one, documenting alternatives in candidate_matches. Do not access salary or other restricted fields; only use allowed fields such as id, name, email, location, and department.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"resolution_method":{"type":"string"},"candidate_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","found"]}
