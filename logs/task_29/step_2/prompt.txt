Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables, fields, or services) that represent projects, project team membership, and the role responsible for quality assurance.
Approach: Based on the schema and any technical documentation, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over available technical descriptions for entities like 'project', 'team member', 'role', and 'QA'. Confirm which tables and fields to use: for example, project for projects and team_member for membership with role values, and determine which role value(s) (for example 'QA') correspond to someone responsible for quality assurance, using the results from Step 1. If there are naming variations or typos in documentation (for example 'Q/A', 'QualityAssurance'), use fuzzy matching and partial matching to interpret them.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"implementation_entities":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"qa_role_values":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"notes":{"type":"string"}},"required":["has_implementation","implementation_entities","qa_role_values"]}
