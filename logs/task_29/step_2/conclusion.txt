STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

I have executed Step 2 by thoroughly searching the technical documentation. Let me verify and consolidate my findings:

**Execution Details:**
1. I searched the available wiki files for technical documentation about project implementation, team membership, and QA roles.
2. I examined the project registry documentation in detail (systems/project_registry.md) which explicitly defines:
   - Projects have a "team" field containing a list of team members
   - Each team member has: assigned employee, role, and time slice (fraction of FTE)
   - The role values are explicitly listed as: Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other
3. I verified there are no other technical database tables, fields, or services mentioned in the available documentation beyond what's in the project registry.
4. I confirmed through fuzzy search that "QA" is the exact role value (not "Q/A", "QualityAssurance", or other variations).

**Verified Facts (from function returns):**
1. From `list_wiki()`: We have documentation files including "systems/project_registry.md"
2. From `load_wiki("systems/project_registry.md")`: Lines 34-36 and 67 explicitly state:
   - "Team and workloads:" 
   - "Their role (Lead, Engineer, Designer, QA, Ops, Other)"
   - "Role – the project role (Lead, Engineer, QA, Ops, Other)"
3. From `search_wiki()` and `search_wiki_fuzzy()`: No other variations of QA role values were found in the technical documentation.
4. The available API functions (`get_project()`, `ProjectFull`, `TeamMember`) confirm this implementation structure matches the documentation.

**No state-changing functions were called** - only read operations on documentation.

**Conclusion:** The technical implementation uses the "project" entity with a "team" field containing "team_member" objects, and the QA role value is exactly "QA".

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "implementation_entities": ["project", "team_member"],
  "qa_role_values": ["QA"],
  "notes": "The project registry system defines projects with a 'team' field containing a list of team members. Each team member has: employee (ID), role (string), and time_slice (float). The role value for quality assurance responsibility is exactly 'QA' as documented in systems/project_registry.md lines 36 and 67. No other variations or alternative spellings were found in the technical documentation."
