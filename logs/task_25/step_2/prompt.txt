Step 2: Retrieve the current calendar date from a trusted system source instead of relying on the task text.
Approach: Use a system time or date application programming interface to obtain the current date in a standard unambiguous format such as ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). Do not assume that the date stated in the task is correct; the system date should be treated as the source of truth.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"}},"required":["current_date"]}
