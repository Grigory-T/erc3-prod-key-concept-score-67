We are in Step 2. The step requires retrieving the current calendar date from a trusted system source.
 We have the `who_ami` function which returns a `WhoAmI` object that includes a `today` field (date string in the format 'YYYY-MM-DD').
 We can use that as the system date. The step says to use a system time or date API, and the `today` field from the identity context is a system-provided date.
 However, note that the step says "instead of relying on the task text", so we should use the system date, not the one in the task context.

 Let's call `who_ami` again to get the current date. Even though we called it in Step 1, we should call it again to ensure we have the current system date.

 But note: the `who_ami` function returns the current user context, and in the current context we already have today's date as 2025-04-02.
 However, we should still call the function to get the system date.

 However, note that the function returns a `WhoAmI` object with a `today` attribute. We can use that.

 Let's write the code to call `who_ami` and extract the `today` field.

We are in step 2 of the task. We have already checked the user identity and permissions in step 1 and confirmed that the user is a public guest and allowed to ask a general calendar date question.
 Now, step 2 requires us to retrieve the current calendar date from a trusted system source. The system source is the `who_am_i()` function which returns a `WhoAmI` object that includes a `today` field (a string in the format YYYY-MM-DD).
 We have just called `who_am_i()` and printed the current date: 2025-04-02.
 This is the system date, and we must return it in the expected output format.

 However, note that the task's global context says "Date: 2025-04-02", but the step says not to rely on the task text and use the system source. We have done that.

 Expected output for this step is a JSON object with a property "current_date" of type string in date format.

 Let's construct the JSON accordingly.

We are at Step 2. The step says: "Retrieve the current calendar date from a trusted system source instead of relying on the task text."

We have done exactly that by calling `who_am_i()` and obtaining the `today` field, which is a string in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The step does not require any other actions. We have printed the current date from the system and it is 2025-04-02.

We must output the JSON with the current_date.

We have not changed any state, so no need to mention that.

I am confident that we have completed the step as instructed.

Thus, we repeat the final answer and JSON blocks.
