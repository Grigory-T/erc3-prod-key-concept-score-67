I executed Step 2 as instructed by retrieving the current calendar date from a trusted system source. I used the `who_am_i()` function which provides the system date in the `today` field, returning the current date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). The system returned "2025-04-02", which I verified by printing the result. No assumptions were made - I relied solely on the system-provided date rather than the task text. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_date": "2025-04-02"
}
