## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Check current user identity and permissions to confirm that answering a general calendar date question is allowed for a public (guest) user.
Approach: Call the identity service (for example, who_am_i()) to retrieve the current user identifier, public or authenticated status, and any associated roles. Confirm that the user is a guest/public and that responding to a neutral, general date computation question does not require access to restricted systems such as CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki. If for any reason this simple date computation would require restricted access, mark the operation as not allowed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"is_public":{"type":"boolean"},"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","is_public","allowed"]}
**Result:** Step 1 completed successfully. I called the identity service (who_am_i()) to retrieve the current user context. The user is a public/guest user with no authentication (current_user: empty string, is_public: True). I verified that answering a general calendar date question is allowed because it only requires publicly available information and doesn't access any restricted systems like CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki. The date computation is a neutral question that doesn't require any internal system access.

{
  "user_id": "",
  "is_public": true,
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "Calendar date computation is publicly available information"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Retrieve the current calendar date from a trusted system source instead of relying on the task text.
Approach: Use a system time or date application programming interface to obtain the current date in a standard unambiguous format such as ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD). Do not assume that the date stated in the task is correct; the system date should be treated as the source of truth.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"}},"required":["current_date"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 2 as instructed by retrieving the current calendar date from a trusted system source. I used the `who_am_i()` function which provides the system date in the `today` field, returning the current date in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). The system returned "2025-04-02", which I verified by printing the result. No assumptions were made - I relied solely on the system-provided date rather than the task text. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "current_date": "2025-04-02"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Compute the calendar date that is exactly seven days before the retrieved current date.
Approach: Using date arithmetic on the current_date value, subtract exactly seven days, correctly handling month and year boundaries and leap years as needed. Store both the original current_date and the resulting date_minus_seven_days in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_minus_seven_days":{"type":"string","format":"date"}},"required":["current_date","date_minus_seven_days"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 as instructed. I computed the calendar date exactly seven days before the retrieved current date by performing date arithmetic. Using the current date of 2025-04-02 from Step 2, I subtracted exactly 7 days to get 2025-03-26, correctly handling month and year boundaries. Both dates are stored in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format as required. All values were explicitly verified from the function returns in Step 2, and no assumptions or made-up data were used. This was a pure computational step with no state-changing operations.

{
  "current_date": "2025-04-02",
  "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26"
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Format the computed date_minus_seven_days into the requested DD-MM-YYYY string representation.
Approach: Take the date_minus_seven_days value in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format, parse it into its day, month, and year components, and reassemble it into a string formatted as DD-MM-YYYY, padding day and month with a leading zero if necessary.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"date_minus_seven_days":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_dd_mm_yyyy":{"type":"string"}},"required":["date_minus_seven_days","date_dd_mm_yyyy"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I formatted the date_minus_seven_days value "2025-03-26" from Step 3 into the requested DD-MM-YYYY string representation "26-03-2025". This was done by parsing the ISO 8601 format date, extracting the day, month, and year components, and reassembling them with day and month already zero-padded as required. All values were explicitly verified from the function returns in previous steps, and no assumptions or made-up data were used. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26",
  "date_dd_mm_yyyy": "26-03-2025"
}

### Final Result
The date a week ago from 2025-04-02 was 26-03-2025.
