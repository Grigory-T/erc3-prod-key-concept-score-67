We are on Step 4 of the global task.
 The goal of this step is to format the computed date_minus_seven_days (which is in ISO 8601 format, i.e., YYYY-MM-DD) into DD-MM-YYYY.

 We have from Step 3:
   current_date: 2025-04-02
   date_minus_seven_days: 2025-03-26

 We need to convert "2025-03-26" to "26-03-2025".

 Steps in code:
   1. We already have the date_minus_seven_days from Step 3. However, note that the step description says to take the date_minus_seven_days value.
   2. Parse the string into year, month, day.
   3. Reformat to DD-MM-YYYY, ensuring two digits for day and month.

 Since we are in a step-by-step execution, we should not rely on variables from previous steps but instead use the output of Step 3.
 However, note that the current step is independent and we are given the value in the step description (from the result of Step 3).

 But note: The step says "Take the date_minus_seven_days value in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format".
 We have that value from the previous step: "2025-03-26".

 We can write code to parse and reformat.

 However, note that we are not allowed to use logical defaults or stub. We must rely on available functions return.
 But in this case, we are only doing string manipulation on a known value.

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 Important: We must output the same date_minus_seven_days in ISO format and the new formatted string.

 We are allowed to write Python code and print the results.

 Let's break down:
   We have: date_minus_seven_days = "2025-03-26"
   We want: "26-03-2025"

 Steps:
   Split by '-': [2025, 03, 26]
   Then format: f"{day:02d}-{month:02d}-{year}"
   But note: the original string already has zero-padded month and day, so we can split and then format without worrying.

 However, to be safe, we can convert to integers and then format with zero padding.

 Alternatively, we can use datetime module for parsing and formatting, but note that the available functions do not include datetime.
 But we are allowed to use standard Python libraries? The instructions do not specify, but we are in a Python code block.

 Since the step is about string manipulation, we can do it without importing datetime.

 Let's do:
   parts = date_minus_seven_days.split('-')
   year = parts[0]
   month = parts[1]
   day = parts[2]
   date_dd_mm_yyyy = f"{day}-{month}-{year}"

 But note: the day and month are already zero-padded in the original string, so this would work.

 However, if the original string had no zero padding, we would need to pad. But the ISO format is YYYY-MM-DD with zero padding.

 So we can do:

   date_dd_mm_yyyy = f"{parts[2]}-{parts[1]}-{parts[0]}"

 Let's write the code accordingly.

 We are going to output:
   {
     "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26",
     "date_dd_mm_yyyy": "26-03-2025"
   }

 But note: the step expects the output to have the date_minus_seven_days in ISO and the new format.

 Let's code accordingly.

 However, note that the step says to format the computed date_minus_seven_days. We are using the value from Step 3.

 Since we are in a new step, we are going to assume that the value is available in the context of the step.

 We are not going to call any external function for the date because it was already computed in Step 3.

 Let's write the code.

Now I need to provide the final answer with JSON output as specified in the expected output format for Step 4.
The expected output requires two properties: date_minus_seven_days (in ISO format) and date_dd_mm_yyyy (in DD-MM-YYYY format).
From the code execution, I have:
- date_minus_seven_days = "2025-03-26" (from Step 3, used as input)
- date_dd_mm_yyyy = "26-03-2025" (computed in Step 4)

I should return these in the JSON.

We are on Step 4 of the task, and the user is asking to verify the step before accepting the conclusion.
 Let's check the checklist:

 1. Did you execute the step instruction?
    - Yes, I executed Step 4: formatted the date_minus_seven_days ("2025-03-26") into DD-MM-YYYY ("26-03-2025").

 2. Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
    - No, I did not skip or assume anything. I used the date_minus_seven_days from Step 3 (which was verified and printed in the previous step) and formatted it as required.

 3. Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
    - Yes, the date_minus_seven_days was taken from the result of Step 3, which was explicitly printed and verified. The formatting was done by splitting the string and reassembling, which is a straightforward string operation.

 4. JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
    - The JSON I provided contains:
        "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26" (from Step 3, verified by printing in Step 3 and again in Step 4)
        "date_dd_mm_yyyy": "26-03-2025" (computed and printed in Step 4)

 5. update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
    - No update functions were called in this step. Only string manipulation.

 6. if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.
    - No state was changed.

 Since the step is complete and verified, I will repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
