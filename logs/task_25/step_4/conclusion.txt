Step 4 completed successfully. I formatted the date_minus_seven_days value "2025-03-26" from Step 3 into the requested DD-MM-YYYY string representation "26-03-2025". This was done by parsing the ISO 8601 format date, extracting the day, month, and year components, and reassembling them with day and month already zero-padded as required. All values were explicitly verified from the function returns in previous steps, and no assumptions or made-up data were used. No state-changing operations were performed in this step.

{
  "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26",
  "date_dd_mm_yyyy": "26-03-2025"
}
