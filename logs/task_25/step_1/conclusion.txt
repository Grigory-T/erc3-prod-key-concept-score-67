Step 1 completed successfully. I called the identity service (who_am_i()) to retrieve the current user context. The user is a public/guest user with no authentication (current_user: empty string, is_public: True). I verified that answering a general calendar date question is allowed because it only requires publicly available information and doesn't access any restricted systems like CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki. The date computation is a neutral question that doesn't require any internal system access.

{
  "user_id": "",
  "is_public": true,
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "Calendar date computation is publicly available information"
}
