Step 1: Check current user identity and permissions to confirm that answering a general calendar date question is allowed for a public (guest) user.
Approach: Call the identity service (for example, who_am_i()) to retrieve the current user identifier, public or authenticated status, and any associated roles. Confirm that the user is a guest/public and that responding to a neutral, general date computation question does not require access to restricted systems such as CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, or InternalWiki. If for any reason this simple date computation would require restricted access, mark the operation as not allowed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"is_public":{"type":"boolean"},"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","is_public","allowed"]}
