We are at Step 1. The step is to check current user identity and permissions to confirm that answering a general calendar date question is allowed for a public (guest) user.

 We need to:
 1. Call who_ami_i() to get current user context.
 2. Based on the user's status (is_public) and the fact that the question is a neutral, general date computation question (does not require access to restricted systems), determine if allowed.
 3. The expected output is a JSON with user_id, is_public, allowed, and reason.

 According to the company rules:
   - IF user.is_authenticated == false THEN DENY all_access_to({CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions}); 
   - However, the question is about a general calendar date, which does not require access to any of the restricted systems.

 We are to confirm that the user is a guest and that responding to this question is allowed because it is neutral and does not require restricted access.

 Let's execute:

[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 20:16:02

We are asked to provide output in a specific JSON format.
 According to the expected output, we need:
   user_id (string), is_public (boolean), allowed (boolean), reason (string)

 From the code execution, we have:
   current_user is empty string (since it's public)
   is_public: True
   allowed: True
   reason: "Calendar date computation is publicly available information"

 However, note that the current_user in the context is an empty string. We should return that as the user_id.

 Let's construct the JSON accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are executing Step 1 of the task. The step is to check current user identity and permissions to confirm that answering a general calendar date question is allowed for a public (guest) user.

 We have already executed the code and obtained the following from the identity service (who_am_i()):
   - user_id: "" (empty string, meaning no user identifier)
   - is_public: True
   - department: "" (empty)
   - location: "" (empty)

 We also printed the allowed status and reason.

 According to the company rules:
   - Guest/Public User Rules: If user.is_authenticated == false then deny all_access_to({CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions}).
   - However, the task is to answer a general calendar date question, which does not require access to any of the restricted systems.

 Therefore, we consider that a public user is allowed to ask a neutral, general date computation question.

 The expected output requires:
   - user_id: string (we have an empty string, which is acceptable for a public user)
   - is_public: boolean (True)
   - allowed: boolean (True, as per our reasoning)
   - reason: string (we provided one)

 We have already printed all the necessary values and derived the allowed status.

 Let's verify that we have not missed any part of the step:
   - We called the identity service (who_am_i()).
   - We retrieved the current user identifier (empty string for public user).
   - We confirmed the user is a guest/public (is_public=True).
   - We confirmed that responding to a neutral, general date computation question does not require access to restricted systems (reason: "Calendar date computation is publicly available information").
   - We set allowed to True.

 We did not skip any action. All facts are verified by the function return.

 We did not change the state of any object, so no state-changing operations were performed.

 We are now ready to provide the final answer and JSON.
