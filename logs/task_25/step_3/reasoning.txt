We are given the current date from the previous step: 2025-04-02.
 We need to compute the date exactly seven days before this date.
 We must handle month and year boundaries correctly.

 Approach:
 We can use Python's datetime module to parse the current date, subtract 7 days, and then format the result.

 However, note that the system date is in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD).

 Steps in code:
 1. Parse the current date string into a datetime object.
 2. Subtract a timedelta of 7 days.
 3. Format the resulting datetime object back to a string in ISO format.

 We must ensure we use the date from the previous step, which is stored in the context as "2025-04-02".

 But note: the current step does not have the date as an input. We have to rely on the previous step's output.
 However, the instruction says to use the retrieved current date. Since we are in a continuous context, we can assume the current date is 2025-04-02.

 Let's write the code to compute the date seven days before 2025-04-02.

 We are also expected to output both the current date and the computed date.

 Important: We are not allowed to use any state-changing functions in this step, so it's safe.

 We'll write the code in a Python block.

First, the task is Step 3: Compute the calendar date that is exactly seven days before the retrieved current date. The expected output is a JSON object with properties "current_date" and "date_minus_seven_days" in ISO 8601 format.

From the code execution result:
- Current date from Step 2: 2025-04-02
- Date minus seven days: 2025-03-26

So, current_date is "2025-04-02" and date_minus_seven_days is "2025-03-26".

I need to provide the final answer in the specified format with JSON output.

Check the response format: I need to have <final_answer> and <json> tags.

In the final_answer, I should include a conclusion for this step, but since it's straightforward, I can state that the computation was successful.

Then, the JSON should match the expected output.

JSON structure:
{
  "current_date": "2025-04-02",
  "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26"
}

In the system, the date was retrieved from who_am_i().today in Step 2, and I used that value directly. It's correct.

Now, write the response.

We are in Step 3. The step asks to compute the calendar date that is exactly seven days before the retrieved current date.
 We have already retrieved the current date in Step 2 as "2025-04-02". We must use that date.
 We have computed the date minus seven days as "2025-03-26".
 We have printed both dates in ISO 8601 format.
 The step does not require any additional function calls or state changes. It's a pure computation.

 Let me double-check the computation:
   Current date: 2025-04-02
   Subtract 7 days: 
       2025 is not a leap year (2024 was, 2025 is not). 
       March has 31 days, so going back 7 days from April 2:
          April 1 (1 day), March 31 (2), March 30 (3), March 29 (4), March 28 (5), March 27 (6), March 26 (7).

   So 2025-03-26 is correct.

 The step was completed as per the instructions. We used the current_date from Step 2 and performed date arithmetic.

 The expected output is a JSON object with current_date and date_minus_seven_days in ISO format.

 We have that.

 Let me also note: The step did not require any state-changing operations, so no risk of multiple calls.

 We are confident in the result.
