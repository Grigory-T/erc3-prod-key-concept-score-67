I have successfully executed Step 3 as instructed. I computed the calendar date exactly seven days before the retrieved current date by performing date arithmetic. Using the current date of 2025-04-02 from Step 2, I subtracted exactly 7 days to get 2025-03-26, correctly handling month and year boundaries. Both dates are stored in ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD) format as required. All values were explicitly verified from the function returns in Step 2, and no assumptions or made-up data were used. This was a pure computational step with no state-changing operations.

{
  "current_date": "2025-04-02",
  "date_minus_seven_days": "2025-03-26"
}
