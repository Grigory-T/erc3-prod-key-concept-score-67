DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:16:24
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous step (Step 1) completed successfully, confirming that the user's request is permissible and does not require access to restricted systems. The next step in the plan is to retrieve the current date from a system source. There are no new complications or incorrect results encountered so far. All steps in the plan remain valid according to the original wording and the task requirements.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:17:05
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have executed as planned and produced the expected results according to the task's original plan. The current system date has been successfully retrieved and is available for the following date arithmetic and formatting steps. There have been no errors, unexpected results, or missing information that would necessitate replanning or aborting the task. The next logical step is to continue according to the original task plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:17:58
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The plan has proceeded correctly and the last completed step (Step 3) provided the expected and correct result. No inconsistencies or unexpected results have been encountered. The next step (Step 4) is straightforward formatting of the already-computed date to the requested string format, which is clearly achievable. Therefore, the best course of action is to continue with the plan and execute the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:19:08
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps in the original plan were executed successfully, with each producing the expected result. There are no remaining steps. The calculation was done fully and correctly, with the last computed answer matching the requested format (DD-MM-YYYY). The task is therefore complete, and a final answer can be given.
