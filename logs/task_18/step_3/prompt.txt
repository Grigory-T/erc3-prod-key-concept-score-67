Step 3: Analyze the collected list of company locations to determine whether any of them are in Dubai, and derive a boolean flag indicating if the company operates in Dubai.
Approach: Inspect each entry in the locations list and compare the city_or_region and country values against "Dubai" and "United Arab Emirates" using exact string comparison on normalized (lowercased, trimmed) values. Because the term "Dubai" is unambiguous and appears as a full city name, fuzzy or semantic searching is not necessary. If any location matches Dubai as the city or region, set operates_in_dubai to true; otherwise, set operates_in_dubai to false.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "operates_in_dubai": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["operates_in_dubai"] }
