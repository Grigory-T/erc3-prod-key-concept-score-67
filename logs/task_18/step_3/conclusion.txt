I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed. I analyzed the collected list of company locations from Step 2, comparing each location's city/region and country values against "Dubai" and "United Arab Emirates" using exact string comparison on normalized (lowercased, trimmed) values. After checking all 7 locations, none matched Dubai or the UAE. The re-verification code confirms the same result. No internal systems were accessed, no fuzzy or semantic searching was needed, and no state-changing operations were performed. All facts were derived from the provided context (the locations list from Step 2). The conclusion is based solely on verified data.

{"operates_in_dubai": false}
