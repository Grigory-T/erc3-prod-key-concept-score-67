Step 2: Collect the list of known company operating locations (headquarters, factories, and offices) from the provided context to use as the authoritative reference for determining if the company operates in Dubai.
Approach: From the task context, extract the explicitly listed locations: Headquarters and Italian Factory in Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory near Novi Sad in northern Serbia, and offices in Munich (Germany), Paris (France), Rotterdam (Netherlands), Barcelona (Spain), and Vienna (Austria). Store these as a structured list of city or area names and corresponding countries for further evaluation. No database or fuzzy search is required because the locations are explicitly enumerated in the prompt.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "locations": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "site_type": { "type": "string" }, "city_or_region": { "type": "string" }, "country": { "type": "string" } , "description": { "type": "string" } }, "required": ["site_type", "city_or_region", "country"] } } }, "required": ["locations"] }
