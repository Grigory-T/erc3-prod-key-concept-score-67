I have executed Step 2 exactly as instructed. I collected the list of known company operating locations directly from the provided context without using any database queries or fuzzy searches, as specified in the approach. I parsed the explicit locations mentioned in the initial company description and structured them into the required format. All facts were verified from the context provided, and no assumptions or made-up data were used. No state-changing operations were performed.
