STEP 1 - CONCLUSION

I have completed Step 1 by executing the required actions:

1. Called `who_am_i()` to get the current user context, which returned:
   - current_user: empty (None)
   - is_public: True
   - department: empty
   - location: empty

2. Analyzed this context to determine:
   - user_authenticated: False (since is_public is True and current_user is empty)
   - actor_type: "guest" (based on is_public status)

3. Applied company rules which state: "IF user.is_authenticated == false THEN DENY all_access_to({CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki, ChatbotActions})"

4. Determined that answering whether the company operates in Dubai can be done from the publicly available company information provided in the context (company locations are listed in the initial context), without needing to query any internal systems.

All facts were verified from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed. No internal system access was attempted or required. The conclusion is based solely on verified function returns and company rules.

{
  "user_authenticated": false,
  "actor_type": "guest",
  "internal_system_access_required": false,
  "internal_system_access_permitted": false
}
