Step 1: Determine current user context and confirm that, as a public unauthenticated user, no access to internal systems (Customer Relationship Management system, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, Internal Wiki, Chatbot Actions) is required to answer whether the company operates in Dubai.
Approach: Use the provided session context to identify that the current actor is a guest (anonymous, public user) with no employee identifier and no system roles. Explicitly confirm that answering a high-level question about company operating locations (such as whether the company operates in Dubai) can be done solely from already provided public context, without querying internal systems or restricted data.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_authenticated": { "type": "boolean" }, "actor_type": { "type": "string" }, "internal_system_access_required": { "type": "boolean" } , "internal_system_access_permitted": { "type": "boolean" } }, "required": ["user_authenticated", "actor_type", "internal_system_access_required", "internal_system_access_permitted"] }
