DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:00:04
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed successfully and produced the expected results. The remaining steps of the plan can proceed as written. No unexpected results or new information have appeared that would require a replan or abort. The next step is to extract company locations from the provided context, as per Step 2 of the plan.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:03:52
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is progressing correctly according to the original plan. Steps 1 and 2 are completed exactly as specified: the user context was verified (public guest, no internal access needed), and all operating locations were extracted from the provided company context. The next step is to analyze whether any of those locations are in Dubai, which follows directly from the current results. No unexpected results or missing information have occurred, and all required inputs for the next step are present. Therefore, the correct action is to continue to Step 3.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:05:04
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The previous steps have been completed exactly as described in the original plan. The analysis clearly shows that there are no company locations in Dubai or the United Arab Emirates. The next step, per plan, is to provide a single-word answer based on the flag 'operates_in_dubai', which is false. Thus, the answer should be 'No'. The requirements for FINAL_ANSWER are fully satisfied and there is no need to continue, abort, or replan.
