We are at Step 5. We need to verify the swap by re-querying the project team for the two employees and confirming the roles and time_slice values have been swapped.

 Steps:
 1. Use the project_id from Step 1: "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining"
 2. Use the employee IDs from Step 2: Camilla (CjTb_047) and Sonia (CjTb_029)
 3. Get the current project details (including team) by calling get_project(project_id)
 4. From the team list, extract the entries for the two employees.
 5. Compare with the expected swapped values (from Step 4: Camilla should now be Engineer with 0.3, Sonia should now be Lead with 0.5)
 6. Set verified to True if both match, otherwise False.
 7. Also note if there are any discrepancies.

 We must also check that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project.

 Let's execute.

We are in the middle of a code block and got a syntax error. Let me rewrite the code properly.
 The issue is that the `else` is not properly indented or the `if` block is not structured correctly.
 I will rewrite the entire code with proper indentation and structure.

We have successfully verified the swap. The output shows:
- Camilla (CjTb_047) is now Engineer with time_slice=0.3
- Sonia (CjTb_029) is now Lead with time_slice=0.5

This matches the expected swap from Step 4.

Now, we need to format the final answer according to the expected output schema.

Expected Output Schema:
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "project_id": {"type": ["string", "null"]},
    "camilla_final": {"type": ["object", "null"], "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string"}, "time_slice": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "role", "time_slice"]},
    "sonia_final": {"type": ["object", "null"], "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "role": {"type": "string"}, "time_slice": {"type": "number"}}, "required": ["employee_id", "role", "time_slice"]},
    "verified": {"type": "boolean"},
    "notes": {"type": ["string", "null"]}
  },
  "required": ["verified"]
}

We have:
- project_id: "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining"
- camilla_final: object with employee_id, role, time_slice
- sonia_final: object with employee_id, role, time_slice
- verified: True
- notes: "Verification completed. Roles and workloads have been successfully swapped."

We must output in JSON format within <json> tags.

Let's construct the JSON accordingly.

The user asks for verification of Step 5 execution. I have already executed Step 5 and printed the results. Let me review the checklist.

Checklist:
1. Did I execute the step instruction? Yes, I re-queried the team_member table by getting the project with get_project(project_id) and examined the team members for Camilla and Sonia. I confirmed their role and time_slice fields.
2. Did I skip or assume any action? No, I followed the approach: re-query the team_member table, confirm swapped values, produce summary object. I used the exact project_id and employee identifiers from previous steps.
3. Are all facts verified? Yes, I printed the project details, team members, and each employee's role and time_slice. The facts are from function returns (get_project). No assumptions made.

JSON response: The JSON I provided contains only values explicitly printed: project_id, camilla_final (employee_id, role, time_slice), sonia_final (employee_id, role, time_slice), verified (True), notes (from printed verification). All derived from printed output.

No state-changing functions were called in Step 5 (only get_project, which is read-only). So no state changes to report.

Thus, I am confident in the results. I will repeat both blocks.
