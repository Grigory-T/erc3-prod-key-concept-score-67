## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-10
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_001
User details: {"id": "CjTb_001", "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Adjust hygienic tank lining development for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions and swap roles AND workloads of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia (fix earlier entry mistake).

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and the associated project focused on "hygienic tank lining development" that must be adjusted.
Approach: Query the customer table to find records whose name exactly matches "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive containment checks on the normalized name field and then apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic or logical matching that can handle possible spelling errors and small variations (for example, "Mediterranean Bottling Solution" or "Med Bottling Solutions"). Once customer candidates are identified, query the project table for projects linked to the selected customer_id where the project name or description contains the normalized phrase "hygienic tank lining development". If still not found, search across all projects with case-insensitive containment, then apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search on both name and description to capture close variants (for example, "hygienic tank lining dev" or "tank hygiene lining development"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list all candidates so that a unique target project can be selected later; if exactly one is confidently matched, mark it as selected_project_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
**Result:** Yes, I executed Step 1 according to the instructions. I followed the specified approach: first searching for the customer "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" using exact matching (none found), then case-insensitive containment (none found), then fuzzy matching (found 1 candidate with score 0.708). I verified this candidate is "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage" (ID: cust_mediterranean_bottling). Then I searched for projects associated with this customer containing "hygienic tank lining development". I searched projects linked to the customer ID, then searched all projects, and finally used fuzzy matching which found one project: "Hygienic tank lining series" (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). I retrieved its full details to confirm the description matches the development focus. Both the customer and project have high confidence matches (customer score 0.708, project score 1.0), so I selected them. All data comes from function returns: list_all_customers(), fuzzy_compare(), search_customers(), search_projects(), and get_project(). No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "customer_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
      "name": "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage",
      "match_score": 0.708
    }
  ],
  "selected_customer_id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
  "project_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
      "name": "Hygienic tank lining series",
      "description": "Development of solventborne and waterborne tank linings for Mediterranean Bottling syrup and water tanks.",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the employee records for "Camilla Marchetti" and "Herrera Sonia" in order to operate on their roles and workloads within the identified project.
Approach: Query the employee table using the full name field to find an exact match for "Camilla Marchetti" and separately for "Herrera Sonia". If no exact match is found for a given name, relax the search to case-insensitive containment on the name field (for example, searching for "camilla" and "marchetti" tokens inside the full name). If there are still no results or there are multiple results, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search that can handle transposed first and last names, missing middle names, small spelling deviations, or alternative orderings (for example, "Marcheti Camila" or "Sonia Herrera"). For each target person, produce either a single selected employee_id when unique, or a list of candidate employees when ambiguous, along with basic data needed for later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"camilla_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_camilla_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"sonia_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_sonia_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["camilla_candidates","sonia_candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 2. All facts were derived from function returns with no assumptions:

1. **Camilla Marchetti**: Found exact match (score: 1.0) with employee ID `CjTb_047`, name "Camilla Marchetti". Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_047")` confirms her details: department "R&D and Technical Service", location "HQ – Italy". There is another employee "Fabio Marchetti" but this does not create ambiguity for "Camilla Marchetti".

2. **Herrera Sonia**: Found partial match (score: 0.8) with employee ID `CjTb_029`, name "Sonia Herrera" (transposed first/last name). Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_029")` confirms her details: department "Sales & Customer Success", location "Barcelona Office – Spain". No other employees contain "herrera" or "sonia".

No state-changing operations were performed. The results are accurate and ready for use in subsequent steps.

{
  "camilla_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_047",
      "name": "Camilla Marchetti",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_camilla_id": "CjTb_047",
  "sonia_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_029",
      "name": "Sonia Herrera",
      "match_score": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "selected_sonia_id": "CjTb_029"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine whether the current user, Giovanni Rinaldi (employee id CjTb_001), has sufficient permissions to modify team roles and workloads for the identified project, following company permission policies.
Approach: Call the identity and authorization service (for example, a who_am_i function bound to the EmployeeRegistry and role system) to retrieve the current user record and their system_roles, department, and any project-specific leadership assignments. Using the project_id from step 1 and the employees from step 2, evaluate whether Giovanni is allowed to perform a ModifyTeamWorkload type action on that project according to the policy: allowed if user.id equals the project manager for that project or if user.system_roles intersects with the allowed roles set such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin, or if Giovanni is recognized as an executive with global project-operation rights based on his Corporate Leadership position. This check must be done after the project and employees are known, and it must result in an explicit boolean flag indicating whether the swap of roles and workloads can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"department":{"type":"string"},"is_executive":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"is_project_lead_or_manager":{"type":"boolean"},"can_modify_team_workload":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","department","is_executive","can_modify_team_workload"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. All facts were explicitly verified through function calls:

1. ✅ Called `who_am_i()` to get user context: User ID CjTb_001, department "Corporate Leadership"
2. ✅ Retrieved project details using `get_project()` with ID from Step 1: confirmed project exists and team structure
3. ✅ Examined project team to check if user is project lead: found Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) as Lead, not Giovanni Rinaldi
4. ✅ Determined executive status based on department "Corporate Leadership" - consistent with company rules
5. ✅ Cannot retrieve `system_roles` via available API functions (not exposed), but this doesn't affect conclusion
6. ✅ Applied company permission policies: executives can perform any actions related to project operations

All facts derived from function returns, no assumptions made. No state-changing operations performed.

{
  "user_id": "CjTb_001",
  "system_roles": [],
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "is_executive": true,
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "is_project_lead_or_manager": false,
  "can_modify_team_workload": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Swap the roles and workloads (time_slice values) of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia within the team_member entries of the target hygienic tank lining development project to correct the earlier entry mistake.
Approach: Provided that step 3 confirms can_modify_team_workload is true and that step 1 and step 2 have identified a single target project_id and unique employee identifiers for Camilla and Sonia, start a database transaction on the team_member table. Select the team_member rows where project_id equals the selected project and employee_id equals selected_camilla_id, and separately where employee_id equals selected_sonia_id. Read and store each row's current role and time_slice values. If either team_member row does not exist, do not perform the swap and instead prepare an error result. If both exist, update the Camilla row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Sonia, and update the Sonia row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Camilla. Commit the transaction. This operation directly swaps both roles and workloads for the project, implementing the requested correction.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"camilla_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"swap_executed":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["swap_executed"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure, found both employees in the team, and executed the role and workload swap. Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) previously had role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) had role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3. After the swap, Camilla now has role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3, and Sonia has role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5. The project team update was successful, and verification confirms the changes are in effect.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.

Step 5 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure and confirmed that the role and workload swap between Camilla Marchetti and Sonia Herrera has been correctly implemented. The verification shows that Camilla (CjTb_047) now has the role "Engineer" with 0.3 time allocation, while Sonia (CjTb_029) now has the role "Lead" with 0.5 time allocation. This matches exactly the expected outcome from the swap performed in Step 4.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"verified":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["verified"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

Step 5 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure by calling get_project() for the hygienic tank lining development project (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). The function returned the project with 3 team members. I examined each team member and confirmed that Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) now has role "Engineer" with time_slice 0.3, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) now has role "Lead" with time_slice 0.5. These values match the intended swap from Step 4. There is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project. The verification flag is true, indicating the project configuration has been correctly adjusted.
