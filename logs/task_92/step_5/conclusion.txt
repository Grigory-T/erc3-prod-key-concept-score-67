STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Step 5 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure by calling get_project() for the hygienic tank lining development project (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). The function returned the project with 3 team members. I examined each team member and confirmed that Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) now has role "Engineer" with time_slice 0.3, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) now has role "Lead" with time_slice 0.5. These values match the intended swap from Step 4. There is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project. The verification flag is true, indicating the project configuration has been correctly adjusted.
