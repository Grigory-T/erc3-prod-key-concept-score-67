Step 5: Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"verified":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["verified"]}
