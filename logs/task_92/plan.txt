Steps:
  1. Identify the correct customer record for "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and the associated project focused on "hygienic tank lining development" that must be adjusted.
     Approach: Query the customer table to find records whose name exactly matches "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive containment checks on the normalized name field and then apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic or logical matching that can handle possible spelling errors and small variations (for example, "Mediterranean Bottling Solution" or "Med Bottling Solutions"). Once customer candidates are identified, query the project table for projects linked to the selected customer_id where the project name or description contains the normalized phrase "hygienic tank lining development". If still not found, search across all projects with case-insensitive containment, then apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search on both name and description to capture close variants (for example, "hygienic tank lining dev" or "tank hygiene lining development"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list all candidates so that a unique target project can be selected later; if exactly one is confidently matched, mark it as selected_project_id.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
  2. Locate the employee records for "Camilla Marchetti" and "Herrera Sonia" in order to operate on their roles and workloads within the identified project.
     Approach: Query the employee table using the full name field to find an exact match for "Camilla Marchetti" and separately for "Herrera Sonia". If no exact match is found for a given name, relax the search to case-insensitive containment on the name field (for example, searching for "camilla" and "marchetti" tokens inside the full name). If there are still no results or there are multiple results, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search that can handle transposed first and last names, missing middle names, small spelling deviations, or alternative orderings (for example, "Marcheti Camila" or "Sonia Herrera"). For each target person, produce either a single selected employee_id when unique, or a list of candidate employees when ambiguous, along with basic data needed for later steps.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"camilla_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_camilla_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"sonia_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_sonia_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["camilla_candidates","sonia_candidates"]}
  3. Determine whether the current user, Giovanni Rinaldi (employee id CjTb_001), has sufficient permissions to modify team roles and workloads for the identified project, following company permission policies.
     Approach: Call the identity and authorization service (for example, a who_am_i function bound to the EmployeeRegistry and role system) to retrieve the current user record and their system_roles, department, and any project-specific leadership assignments. Using the project_id from step 1 and the employees from step 2, evaluate whether Giovanni is allowed to perform a ModifyTeamWorkload type action on that project according to the policy: allowed if user.id equals the project manager for that project or if user.system_roles intersects with the allowed roles set such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin, or if Giovanni is recognized as an executive with global project-operation rights based on his Corporate Leadership position. This check must be done after the project and employees are known, and it must result in an explicit boolean flag indicating whether the swap of roles and workloads can proceed.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"department":{"type":"string"},"is_executive":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"is_project_lead_or_manager":{"type":"boolean"},"can_modify_team_workload":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","department","is_executive","can_modify_team_workload"]}
  4. Swap the roles and workloads (time_slice values) of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia within the team_member entries of the target hygienic tank lining development project to correct the earlier entry mistake.
     Approach: Provided that step 3 confirms can_modify_team_workload is true and that step 1 and step 2 have identified a single target project_id and unique employee identifiers for Camilla and Sonia, start a database transaction on the team_member table. Select the team_member rows where project_id equals the selected project and employee_id equals selected_camilla_id, and separately where employee_id equals selected_sonia_id. Read and store each row's current role and time_slice values. If either team_member row does not exist, do not perform the swap and instead prepare an error result. If both exist, update the Camilla row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Sonia, and update the Sonia row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Camilla. Commit the transaction. This operation directly swaps both roles and workloads for the project, implementing the requested correction.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"camilla_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"swap_executed":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["swap_executed"]}
  5. Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
     Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"verified":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["verified"]}
