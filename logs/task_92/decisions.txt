DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:15:30
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has completed successfully and produced correct, relevant results per the Original Plan. All required data for the next step is available (selected customer and project). No new inconsistencies or issues have arisen that would require replanning. Remaining steps are still valid as originally written and can proceed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:18:52
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed steps 1 and 2 produced expected, relevant, and correct results according to the plan—customer and project are uniquely and confidently identified, as are the correct employee records for both Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia. There are no discrepancies or missing information. The next planned step is to determine if the current user (Giovanni Rinaldi) has permissions to modify project team roles/workloads, as per company policy. There are no blockers requiring replanning. The original plan is still valid and should be continued to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:21:52
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have returned the expected results exactly as specified in the original plan and all required data for the next step is available. There are no inconsistencies, missing information, or need for replanning. The authorization for the next modification step is validated. Therefore, the plan is still valid and it is correct to continue to the next step as planned.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:24:22
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1-4 have been completed successfully and their outputs are in line with the original plan and expected results. There are no discrepancies or missing information, and all relevant permissions and data were available and correct. The only step left is step 5, which involves verifying the swap in the project team member table and summarizing the result. The plan remains valid, the next step can proceed as written, and no replanning is required.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:26:40
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All steps specified in the original plan have been completed exactly as described. Each step produced the expected result, and there were no discrepancies, missing information, or unexpected outcomes requiring replanning. The final verification confirmed that the swap of roles and workloads between Camilla Marchetti and Sonia Herrera in the 'hygienic tank lining development' project was executed successfully, and the adjusted configuration is in place, matching the intended correction. No further steps remain; the task has reached its objective with full confirmation according to the plan.
