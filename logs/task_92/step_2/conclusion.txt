I have verified the execution of Step 2. All facts were derived from function returns with no assumptions:

1. **Camilla Marchetti**: Found exact match (score: 1.0) with employee ID `CjTb_047`, name "Camilla Marchetti". Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_047")` confirms her details: department "R&D and Technical Service", location "HQ – Italy". There is another employee "Fabio Marchetti" but this does not create ambiguity for "Camilla Marchetti".

2. **Herrera Sonia**: Found partial match (score: 0.8) with employee ID `CjTb_029`, name "Sonia Herrera" (transposed first/last name). Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_029")` confirms her details: department "Sales & Customer Success", location "Barcelona Office – Spain". No other employees contain "herrera" or "sonia".

No state-changing operations were performed. The results are accurate and ready for use in subsequent steps.
