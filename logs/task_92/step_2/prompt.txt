Step 2: Locate the employee records for "Camilla Marchetti" and "Herrera Sonia" in order to operate on their roles and workloads within the identified project.
Approach: Query the employee table using the full name field to find an exact match for "Camilla Marchetti" and separately for "Herrera Sonia". If no exact match is found for a given name, relax the search to case-insensitive containment on the name field (for example, searching for "camilla" and "marchetti" tokens inside the full name). If there are still no results or there are multiple results, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search that can handle transposed first and last names, missing middle names, small spelling deviations, or alternative orderings (for example, "Marcheti Camila" or "Sonia Herrera"). For each target person, produce either a single selected employee_id when unique, or a list of candidate employees when ambiguous, along with basic data needed for later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"camilla_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_camilla_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"sonia_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_sonia_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["camilla_candidates","sonia_candidates"]}
