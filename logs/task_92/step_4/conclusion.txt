Completed: 2025-12-10 00:24:19

Step 4 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure, found both employees in the team, and executed the role and workload swap. Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) previously had role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) had role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3. After the swap, Camilla now has role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3, and Sonia has role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5. The project team update was successful, and verification confirms the changes are in effect.
