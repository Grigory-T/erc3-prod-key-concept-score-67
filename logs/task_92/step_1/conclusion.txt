Yes, I executed Step 1 according to the instructions. I followed the specified approach: first searching for the customer "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" using exact matching (none found), then case-insensitive containment (none found), then fuzzy matching (found 1 candidate with score 0.708). I verified this candidate is "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage" (ID: cust_mediterranean_bottling). Then I searched for projects associated with this customer containing "hygienic tank lining development". I searched projects linked to the customer ID, then searched all projects, and finally used fuzzy matching which found one project: "Hygienic tank lining series" (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). I retrieved its full details to confirm the description matches the development focus. Both the customer and project have high confidence matches (customer score 0.708, project score 1.0), so I selected them. All data comes from function returns: list_all_customers(), fuzzy_compare(), search_customers(), search_projects(), and get_project(). No state-changing operations were performed.
