Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and the associated project focused on "hygienic tank lining development" that must be adjusted.
Approach: Query the customer table to find records whose name exactly matches "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive containment checks on the normalized name field and then apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic or logical matching that can handle possible spelling errors and small variations (for example, "Mediterranean Bottling Solution" or "Med Bottling Solutions"). Once customer candidates are identified, query the project table for projects linked to the selected customer_id where the project name or description contains the normalized phrase "hygienic tank lining development". If still not found, search across all projects with case-insensitive containment, then apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search on both name and description to capture close variants (for example, "hygienic tank lining dev" or "tank hygiene lining development"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list all candidates so that a unique target project can be selected later; if exactly one is confidently matched, mark it as selected_project_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
