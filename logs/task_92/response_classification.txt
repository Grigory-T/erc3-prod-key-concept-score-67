## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and the associated project focused on "hygienic tank lining development" that must be adjusted.
Approach: Query the customer table to find records whose name exactly matches "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive containment checks on the normalized name field and then apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic or logical matching that can handle possible spelling errors and small variations (for example, "Mediterranean Bottling Solution" or "Med Bottling Solutions"). Once customer candidates are identified, query the project table for projects linked to the selected customer_id where the project name or description contains the normalized phrase "hygienic tank lining development". If still not found, search across all projects with case-insensitive containment, then apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search on both name and description to capture close variants (for example, "hygienic tank lining dev" or "tank hygiene lining development"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list all candidates so that a unique target project can be selected later; if exactly one is confidently matched, mark it as selected_project_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
**Result:** Yes, I executed Step 1 according to the instructions. I followed the specified approach: first searching for the customer "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" using exact matching (none found), then case-insensitive containment (none found), then fuzzy matching (found 1 candidate with score 0.708). I verified this candidate is "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage" (ID: cust_mediterranean_bottling). Then I searched for projects associated with this customer containing "hygienic tank lining development". I searched projects linked to the customer ID, then searched all projects, and finally used fuzzy matching which found one project: "Hygienic tank lining series" (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). I retrieved its full details to confirm the description matches the development focus. Both the customer and project have high confidence matches (customer score 0.708, project score 1.0), so I selected them. All data comes from function returns: list_all_customers(), fuzzy_compare(), search_customers(), search_projects(), and get_project(). No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "customer_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
      "name": "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage",
      "match_score": 0.708
    }
  ],
  "selected_customer_id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
  "project_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
      "name": "Hygienic tank lining series",
      "description": "Development of solventborne and waterborne tank linings for Mediterranean Bottling syrup and water tanks.",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the employee records for "Camilla Marchetti" and "Herrera Sonia" in order to operate on their roles and workloads within the identified project.
Approach: Query the employee table using the full name field to find an exact match for "Camilla Marchetti" and separately for "Herrera Sonia". If no exact match is found for a given name, relax the search to case-insensitive containment on the name field (for example, searching for "camilla" and "marchetti" tokens inside the full name). If there are still no results or there are multiple results, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search that can handle transposed first and last names, missing middle names, small spelling deviations, or alternative orderings (for example, "Marcheti Camila" or "Sonia Herrera"). For each target person, produce either a single selected employee_id when unique, or a list of candidate employees when ambiguous, along with basic data needed for later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"camilla_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_camilla_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"sonia_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_sonia_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["camilla_candidates","sonia_candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 2. All facts were derived from function returns with no assumptions:

1. **Camilla Marchetti**: Found exact match (score: 1.0) with employee ID `CjTb_047`, name "Camilla Marchetti". Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_047")` confirms her details: department "R&D and Technical Service", location "HQ – Italy". There is another employee "Fabio Marchetti" but this does not create ambiguity for "Camilla Marchetti".

2. **Herrera Sonia**: Found partial match (score: 0.8) with employee ID `CjTb_029`, name "Sonia Herrera" (transposed first/last name). Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_029")` confirms her details: department "Sales & Customer Success", location "Barcelona Office – Spain". No other employees contain "herrera" or "sonia".

No state-changing operations were performed. The results are accurate and ready for use in subsequent steps.

{
  "camilla_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_047",
      "name": "Camilla Marchetti",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_camilla_id": "CjTb_047",
  "sonia_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_029",
      "name": "Sonia Herrera",
      "match_score": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "selected_sonia_id": "CjTb_029"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Determine whether the current user, Giovanni Rinaldi (employee id CjTb_001), has sufficient permissions to modify team roles and workloads for the identified project, following company permission policies.
Approach: Call the identity and authorization service (for example, a who_am_i function bound to the EmployeeRegistry and role system) to retrieve the current user record and their system_roles, department, and any project-specific leadership assignments. Using the project_id from step 1 and the employees from step 2, evaluate whether Giovanni is allowed to perform a ModifyTeamWorkload type action on that project according to the policy: allowed if user.id equals the project manager for that project or if user.system_roles intersects with the allowed roles set such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin, or if Giovanni is recognized as an executive with global project-operation rights based on his Corporate Leadership position. This check must be done after the project and employees are known, and it must result in an explicit boolean flag indicating whether the swap of roles and workloads can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"department":{"type":"string"},"is_executive":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"is_project_lead_or_manager":{"type":"boolean"},"can_modify_team_workload":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","department","is_executive","can_modify_team_workload"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. All facts were explicitly verified through function calls:

1. ✅ Called `who_am_i()` to get user context: User ID CjTb_001, department "Corporate Leadership"
2. ✅ Retrieved project details using `get_project()` with ID from Step 1: confirmed project exists and team structure
3. ✅ Examined project team to check if user is project lead: found Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) as Lead, not Giovanni Rinaldi
4. ✅ Determined executive status based on department "Corporate Leadership" - consistent with company rules
5. ✅ Cannot retrieve `system_roles` via available API functions (not exposed), but this doesn't affect conclusion
6. ✅ Applied company permission policies: executives can perform any actions related to project operations

All facts derived from function returns, no assumptions made. No state-changing operations performed.

{
  "user_id": "CjTb_001",
  "system_roles": [],
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "is_executive": true,
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "is_project_lead_or_manager": false,
  "can_modify_team_workload": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Swap the roles and workloads (time_slice values) of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia within the team_member entries of the target hygienic tank lining development project to correct the earlier entry mistake.
Approach: Provided that step 3 confirms can_modify_team_workload is true and that step 1 and step 2 have identified a single target project_id and unique employee identifiers for Camilla and Sonia, start a database transaction on the team_member table. Select the team_member rows where project_id equals the selected project and employee_id equals selected_camilla_id, and separately where employee_id equals selected_sonia_id. Read and store each row's current role and time_slice values. If either team_member row does not exist, do not perform the swap and instead prepare an error result. If both exist, update the Camilla row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Sonia, and update the Sonia row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Camilla. Commit the transaction. This operation directly swaps both roles and workloads for the project, implementing the requested correction.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"camilla_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"swap_executed":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["swap_executed"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure, found both employees in the team, and executed the role and workload swap. Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) previously had role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) had role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3. After the swap, Camilla now has role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3, and Sonia has role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5. The project team update was successful, and verification confirms the changes are in effect.

{
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "camilla_before": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_047",
    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "sonia_before": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_029",
    "role": "Engineer",
    "time_slice": 0.3
  },
  "camilla_after": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_047",
    "role": "Engineer",
    "time_slice": 0.3
  },
  "sonia_after": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_029",
    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "swap_executed": true,
  "error_message": null
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"verified":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["verified"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure by calling get_project() for the hygienic tank lining development project (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). The function returned the project with 3 team members. I examined each team member and confirmed that Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) now has role "Engineer" with time_slice 0.3, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) now has role "Lead" with time_slice 0.5. These values match the intended swap from Step 4. There is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project. The verification flag is true, indicating the project configuration has been correctly adjusted.

{
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "camilla_final": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_047",
    "role": "Engineer",
    "time_slice": 0.3
  },
  "sonia_final": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_029",
    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "verified": true,
  "notes": "Verification completed. Roles and workloads have been successfully swapped."
}

### Final Result
The task is complete. The roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Sonia Herrera in the 'hygienic tank lining development' project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions have been successfully swapped and verified. Camilla Marchetti is now Engineer (0.3 FTE) and Sonia Herrera is now Lead (0.5 FTE) in the project team. The adjustment is confirmed and the project configuration is correct.

## Original Task
Adjust hygienic tank lining development for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions and swap roles AND workloads of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia (fix earlier entry mistake).

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and the associated project focused on "hygienic tank lining development" that must be adjusted.
Approach: Query the customer table to find records whose name exactly matches "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive containment checks on the normalized name field and then apply fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic or logical matching that can handle possible spelling errors and small variations (for example, "Mediterranean Bottling Solution" or "Med Bottling Solutions"). Once customer candidates are identified, query the project table for projects linked to the selected customer_id where the project name or description contains the normalized phrase "hygienic tank lining development". If still not found, search across all projects with case-insensitive containment, then apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search on both name and description to capture close variants (for example, "hygienic tank lining dev" or "tank hygiene lining development"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list all candidates so that a unique target project can be selected later; if exactly one is confidently matched, mark it as selected_project_id.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"description":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["customer_candidates","project_candidates"]}
**Result:** Yes, I executed Step 1 according to the instructions. I followed the specified approach: first searching for the customer "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" using exact matching (none found), then case-insensitive containment (none found), then fuzzy matching (found 1 candidate with score 0.708). I verified this candidate is "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage" (ID: cust_mediterranean_bottling). Then I searched for projects associated with this customer containing "hygienic tank lining development". I searched projects linked to the customer ID, then searched all projects, and finally used fuzzy matching which found one project: "Hygienic tank lining series" (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). I retrieved its full details to confirm the description matches the development focus. Both the customer and project have high confidence matches (customer score 0.708, project score 1.0), so I selected them. All data comes from function returns: list_all_customers(), fuzzy_compare(), search_customers(), search_projects(), and get_project(). No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "customer_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
      "name": "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage",
      "match_score": 0.708
    }
  ],
  "selected_customer_id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
  "project_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
      "name": "Hygienic tank lining series",
      "description": "Development of solventborne and waterborne tank linings for Mediterranean Bottling syrup and water tanks.",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the employee records for "Camilla Marchetti" and "Herrera Sonia" in order to operate on their roles and workloads within the identified project.
Approach: Query the employee table using the full name field to find an exact match for "Camilla Marchetti" and separately for "Herrera Sonia". If no exact match is found for a given name, relax the search to case-insensitive containment on the name field (for example, searching for "camilla" and "marchetti" tokens inside the full name). If there are still no results or there are multiple results, apply fuzzy matching and semantic or logical search that can handle transposed first and last names, missing middle names, small spelling deviations, or alternative orderings (for example, "Marcheti Camila" or "Sonia Herrera"). For each target person, produce either a single selected employee_id when unique, or a list of candidate employees when ambiguous, along with basic data needed for later steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"camilla_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_camilla_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"sonia_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name"]}},"selected_sonia_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["camilla_candidates","sonia_candidates"]}
**Result:** I have verified the execution of Step 2. All facts were derived from function returns with no assumptions:

1. **Camilla Marchetti**: Found exact match (score: 1.0) with employee ID `CjTb_047`, name "Camilla Marchetti". Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_047")` confirms her details: department "R&D and Technical Service", location "HQ – Italy". There is another employee "Fabio Marchetti" but this does not create ambiguity for "Camilla Marchetti".

2. **Herrera Sonia**: Found partial match (score: 0.8) with employee ID `CjTb_029`, name "Sonia Herrera" (transposed first/last name). Verification via `get_employee("CjTb_029")` confirms her details: department "Sales & Customer Success", location "Barcelona Office – Spain". No other employees contain "herrera" or "sonia".

No state-changing operations were performed. The results are accurate and ready for use in subsequent steps.

{
  "camilla_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_047",
      "name": "Camilla Marchetti",
      "match_score": 1.0
    }
  ],
  "selected_camilla_id": "CjTb_047",
  "sonia_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "CjTb_029",
      "name": "Sonia Herrera",
      "match_score": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "selected_sonia_id": "CjTb_029"
}

Step 3: Determine whether the current user, Giovanni Rinaldi (employee id CjTb_001), has sufficient permissions to modify team roles and workloads for the identified project, following company permission policies.
Approach: Call the identity and authorization service (for example, a who_am_i function bound to the EmployeeRegistry and role system) to retrieve the current user record and their system_roles, department, and any project-specific leadership assignments. Using the project_id from step 1 and the employees from step 2, evaluate whether Giovanni is allowed to perform a ModifyTeamWorkload type action on that project according to the policy: allowed if user.id equals the project manager for that project or if user.system_roles intersects with the allowed roles set such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin, or if Giovanni is recognized as an executive with global project-operation rights based on his Corporate Leadership position. This check must be done after the project and employees are known, and it must result in an explicit boolean flag indicating whether the swap of roles and workloads can proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"department":{"type":"string"},"is_executive":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"is_project_lead_or_manager":{"type":"boolean"},"can_modify_team_workload":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","system_roles","department","is_executive","can_modify_team_workload"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. All facts were explicitly verified through function calls:

1. ✅ Called `who_am_i()` to get user context: User ID CjTb_001, department "Corporate Leadership"
2. ✅ Retrieved project details using `get_project()` with ID from Step 1: confirmed project exists and team structure
3. ✅ Examined project team to check if user is project lead: found Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) as Lead, not Giovanni Rinaldi
4. ✅ Determined executive status based on department "Corporate Leadership" - consistent with company rules
5. ✅ Cannot retrieve `system_roles` via available API functions (not exposed), but this doesn't affect conclusion
6. ✅ Applied company permission policies: executives can perform any actions related to project operations

All facts derived from function returns, no assumptions made. No state-changing operations performed.

{
  "user_id": "CjTb_001",
  "system_roles": [],
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "is_executive": true,
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "is_project_lead_or_manager": false,
  "can_modify_team_workload": true
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Swap the roles and workloads (time_slice values) of Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia within the team_member entries of the target hygienic tank lining development project to correct the earlier entry mistake.
Approach: Provided that step 3 confirms can_modify_team_workload is true and that step 1 and step 2 have identified a single target project_id and unique employee identifiers for Camilla and Sonia, start a database transaction on the team_member table. Select the team_member rows where project_id equals the selected project and employee_id equals selected_camilla_id, and separately where employee_id equals selected_sonia_id. Read and store each row's current role and time_slice values. If either team_member row does not exist, do not perform the swap and instead prepare an error result. If both exist, update the Camilla row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Sonia, and update the Sonia row to set role and time_slice to the values previously held by Camilla. Commit the transaction. This operation directly swaps both roles and workloads for the project, implementing the requested correction.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_before":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"camilla_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_after":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"swap_executed":{"type":"boolean"},"error_message":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["swap_executed"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure, found both employees in the team, and executed the role and workload swap. Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) previously had role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) had role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3. After the swap, Camilla now has role="Engineer" with time_slice=0.3, and Sonia has role="Lead" with time_slice=0.5. The project team update was successful, and verification confirms the changes are in effect.

{
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "camilla_before": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_047",
    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "sonia_before": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_029",
    "role": "Engineer",

    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "swap_executed": true,
  "error_message": null
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Verify that the hygienic tank lining development project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions now reflects the adjusted configuration with swapped roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Herrera Sonia, and summarize the outcome.
Approach: Re-query the team_member table for the same project_id and the employee identifiers of Camilla and Sonia to confirm that their role and time_slice fields have been successfully swapped compared to the pre-change state captured in step 4. Confirm that there is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project and that the updated values match the intended swap. Interpret this confirmation as evidence that the hygienic tank lining development setup for the Mediterranean Bottling Solutions project has been correctly adjusted. Produce a concise summary object including the verified final roles and workloads for both employees and a boolean verification flag.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"camilla_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"sonia_final":{"type":["object","null"],"properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"role":{"type":"string"},"time_slice":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","role","time_slice"]},"verified":{"type":"boolean"},"notes":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["verified"]}
**Result:** Step 5 completed successfully. I verified the current project team structure by calling get_project() for the hygienic tank lining development project (ID: proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining). The function returned the project with 3 team members. I examined each team member and confirmed that Camilla Marchetti (CjTb_047) now has role "Engineer" with time_slice 0.3, and Sonia Herrera (CjTb_029) now has role "Lead" with time_slice 0.5. These values match the intended swap from Step 4. There is exactly one team_member entry per employee for this project. The verification flag is true, indicating the project configuration has been correctly adjusted.

{
  "project_id": "proj_medibottling_hygienic_tank_lining",
  "camilla_final": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_047",
    "role": "Engineer",
    "time_slice": 0.3
  },
  "sonia_final": {
    "employee_id": "CjTb_029",
    "role": "Lead",
    "time_slice": 0.5
  },
  "verified": true,
  "notes": "Verification completed. Roles and workloads have been successfully swapped."
}

### Final Result
The task is complete. The roles and workloads for Camilla Marchetti and Sonia Herrera in the 'hygienic tank lining development' project for Mediterranean Bottling Solutions have been successfully swapped and verified. Camilla Marchetti is now Engineer (0.3 FTE) and Sonia Herrera is now Lead (0.5 FTE) in the project team. The adjustment is confirmed and the project configuration is correct. No further actions are required.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN

# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-10
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_001
User details: {"id": "CjTb_001", "name": "Giovanni Rinaldi", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
