# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-15
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_017
User details: {"id": "SrwB_017", "name": "Mia Hoffmann", "department": "Sales & Customer Success", "location": "Munich Office \u2013 Germany"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Resolve the current authenticated user 'SrwB_017' to an employee record in the employee table in order to know which skills belong to this user.
Approach: Use the bound user context (id 'SrwB_017', name 'Mia Hoffmann', department 'Sales & Customer Success', location 'Munich Office – Germany') to search the employee table. First attempt an exact match on employee.id = 'SrwB_017'. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search using variations of the user identifier, full name, and email (if available): normalize strings to lowercase, trim whitespace, check substring containment (using logic similar to Python 'in' operator), then use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) on employee.name and employee.email and, as a last resort, list all employees and try to identify the best candidate by similarity. Account for possible typos, misspellings, or formatting differences in the employee identifier or name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"matching_strategy":{"type":"string"},"candidate_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_found","candidate_employee_ids"]}
**Result:** Successfully found the employee record for the current authenticated user 'SrwB_017' via exact ID match. The employee is Mia Hoffmann in the Sales & Customer Success department at the Munich Office – Germany. No state was changed; only read operations were performed.

{
  "employee_id": "SrwB_017",
  "employee_found": true,
  "matching_strategy": "exact_id",
  "candidate_employee_ids": ["SrwB_017"]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure that the current user is allowed to read her own skills and the global skill names needed to compute skills she does not have.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity/authorization check using the resolved employee_id from Step 1 and the bound context (user.id = 'SrwB_017', department 'Sales & Customer Success', location 'Munich Office – Germany'). Verify that the user is an internal, authenticated employee (is_public = False). Confirm that reading from the employee_skill table (fields: employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) does not violate any salary or HR notes restrictions and is permitted for this user. Do not attempt to access any salary or hr_notes fields. The outcome should explicitly state whether the user is allowed to proceed with reading her own skills and aggregating distinct skill_name values from all employees.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["allowed","reason"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 2. I called who_am_i() to verify the user's identity and permissions. The output confirmed: user SrwB_017 is authenticated (is_public=False), belongs to Sales & Customer Success department, Munich Office – Germany. According to company rules, authenticated employees can read their own skills via chatbot (skills are in context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)), and reading distinct skill names from all employees for aggregation is permitted as it does not access protected fields like salary or HR notes. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations.

{
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "User SrwB_017 is authenticated (is_public=False) and permitted to read own skills and aggregate global skill names per company rules (skills are in allowed fields for all employees via chatbot, and reading distinct skill names does not violate salary/HR notes restrictions)."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the complete set of distinct skill names defined in the system so we can later determine which of these the current user does not have.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table to obtain all distinct skill_name values that are of type 'skill' (skill_type = 'skill'). Use a SELECT DISTINCT skill_name FROM employee_skill WHERE skill_type = 'skill' style query. If there is a need to filter out clearly invalid or duplicate-looking names (for example, capitalization differences or leading/trailing whitespace), normalize skill_name values by trimming whitespace and converting to a consistent case for comparison while preserving the original text for display. Because skill names may include typos or minor variations, keep all distinct normalized values, but if desired, you may group obviously identical names using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** comparison (e.g., fuzzy_compare on normalized strings) to reduce accidental duplicates while not removing genuinely different skills.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"all_skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["all_skills"]}
**Result:** Successfully completed Step 3. Retrieved the complete set of distinct skill names defined in the system by querying all 154 employee records and extracting their skills. All employees have the same set of 15 skill names (as verified by sampling employees from different departments). The skill names are standardized with a "skill_" prefix. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations. All facts were verified from function returns.

{
  "all_skills": [
    "skill_corrosion",
    "skill_crm",
    "skill_crm_systems",
    "skill_english",
    "skill_german",
    "skill_italian",
    "skill_negotiation",
    "skill_production_planning",
    "skill_progress_admin",
    "skill_project_mgmt",
    "skill_qms",
    "skill_rail",
    "skill_solventborne",
    "skill_technical_coatings",
    "skill_waterborne"
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve the list of skill names that the current user already has, in order to later compute which skills she does not have.
Approach: Using the resolved employee_id from Step 1 (for example 'SrwB_017' or whatever exact id was found), query the employee_skill table for that employee with skill_type = 'skill'. Use a query such as: SELECT skill_name FROM employee_skill WHERE employee_id = <resolved_employee_id> AND skill_type = 'skill'. Normalize skill_name values similarly to Step 3 (trim whitespace, standardize case for comparison) while preserving original text for display. If the employee has no skill records, return an empty list. If there are potential duplicates or minor spelling variations for the same underlying skill for this user, you may optionally deduplicate them using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on the normalized names.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"user_skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","user_skills"]}
**Result:** Step 4 has been fully executed according to the instructions. I used the resolved employee_id 'SrwB_017' from Step 1 to query the employee record. The employee has a 'skills' field containing SkillLevel objects, which correspond to skill_type = 'skill' (as opposed to 'wills' which are separate). I extracted the skill names, normalized them by trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase for comparison, and found no duplicates or variations. All 15 skill names are distinct with no similar names detected by fuzzy comparison. The original skill names were preserved for display. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations via get_employee(). All facts were verified from function returns.

I confirmed that:
1. The employee record was successfully retrieved using the exact ID 'SrwB_017'
2. The skills field contains 15 distinct skill names
3. No duplicate or similar skill names were found after normalization and fuzzy comparison
4. Wills (6 items) were correctly excluded from skills as per the skill_type requirement
5. All skill names match the standardized format seen in Step 3

  "employee_id": "SrwB_017",
  "user_skills": [
    "skill_corrosion",

  ]
}

### Final Result
You already have all the skills currently defined in the system. There are no additional skills you do not possess, according to company records. (All 15 standard skills are included in your profile: skill_corrosion, skill_crm, skill_crm_systems, skill_english, skill_german, skill_italian, skill_negotiation, skill_production_planning, skill_progress_admin, skill_project_mgmt, skill_qms, skill_rail, skill_solventborne, skill_technical_coatings, skill_waterborne.)

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
