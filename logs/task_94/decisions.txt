DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:14:33
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 is complete and produced the expected output: the employee record for the user was found, matching the plan. There were no errors, and the information matches expectations. There is no evidence that the task or plan is blocked. Next, according to the plan, is Step 2: check permissions for the user to read her own skills and the global skill list. None of the steps or results so far indicate a need to replan, abort, or return a final answer.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:15:54
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is proceeding according to the original plan. Steps 1 and 2 have been completed successfully, confirming user identity and permissions. No unexpected results or missing functions were detected. The next step (Step 3) is to retrieve the set of distinct skill names, followed by determining the user's own skills and completing the main goal. There is no need to replan or abort, and the final results are not yet available.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:19:09
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps up to Step 3 have been successfully completed and have yielded results that are exactly in line with the Original Plan. There have been no unexpected results, missing functions, or discrepancies. The next step is clearly actionable (fetch user-specific skills) and necessary to achieve the final deliverable. The plan remains fully valid and executable. Proceed to Step 4 as outlined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:23:01
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
Both the 'all_skills' list (fully retrieved in Step 3) and 'user_skills' list (fully retrieved in Step 4) are present and, after normalization, they are identical (both lists contain the same 15 standardized skill names). Therefore, when computing the set difference for skills not owned, the result will be an empty set. This matches the Original Plan's intended logic for Step 5. All required information to produce the final answer is now available and the task is complete.
