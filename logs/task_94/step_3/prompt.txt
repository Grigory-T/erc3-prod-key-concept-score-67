Step 3: Retrieve the complete set of distinct skill names defined in the system so we can later determine which of these the current user does not have.
Approach: Query the employee_skill table to obtain all distinct skill_name values that are of type 'skill' (skill_type = 'skill'). Use a SELECT DISTINCT skill_name FROM employee_skill WHERE skill_type = 'skill' style query. If there is a need to filter out clearly invalid or duplicate-looking names (for example, capitalization differences or leading/trailing whitespace), normalize skill_name values by trimming whitespace and converting to a consistent case for comparison while preserving the original text for display. Because skill names may include typos or minor variations, keep all distinct normalized values, but if desired, you may group obviously identical names using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** comparison (e.g., fuzzy_compare on normalized strings) to reduce accidental duplicates while not removing genuinely different skills.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"all_skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["all_skills"]}
