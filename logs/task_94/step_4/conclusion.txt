Step 4 has been fully executed according to the instructions. I used the resolved employee_id 'SrwB_017' from Step 1 to query the employee record. The employee has a 'skills' field containing SkillLevel objects, which correspond to skill_type = 'skill' (as opposed to 'wills' which are separate). I extracted the skill names, normalized them by trimming whitespace and converting to lowercase for comparison, and found no duplicates or variations. All 15 skill names are distinct with no similar names detected by fuzzy comparison. The original skill names were preserved for display. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations via get_employee(). All facts were verified from function returns.

I confirmed that:
1. The employee record was successfully retrieved using the exact ID 'SrwB_017'
2. The skills field contains 15 distinct skill names
3. No duplicate or similar skill names were found after normalization and fuzzy comparison
4. Wills (6 items) were correctly excluded from skills as per the skill_type requirement
5. All skill names match the standardized format seen in Step 3
