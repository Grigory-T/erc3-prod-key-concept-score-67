Step 4: Retrieve the list of skill names that the current user already has, in order to later compute which skills she does not have.
Approach: Using the resolved employee_id from Step 1 (for example 'SrwB_017' or whatever exact id was found), query the employee_skill table for that employee with skill_type = 'skill'. Use a query such as: SELECT skill_name FROM employee_skill WHERE employee_id = <resolved_employee_id> AND skill_type = 'skill'. Normalize skill_name values similarly to Step 3 (trim whitespace, standardize case for comparison) while preserving original text for display. If the employee has no skill records, return an empty list. If there are potential duplicates or minor spelling variations for the same underlying skill for this user, you may optionally deduplicate them using **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on the normalized names.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"user_skills":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","user_skills"]}
