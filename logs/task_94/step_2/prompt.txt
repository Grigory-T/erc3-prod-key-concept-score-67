Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the resolved employee to ensure that the current user is allowed to read her own skills and the global skill names needed to compute skills she does not have.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity/authorization check using the resolved employee_id from Step 1 and the bound context (user.id = 'SrwB_017', department 'Sales & Customer Success', location 'Munich Office – Germany'). Verify that the user is an internal, authenticated employee (is_public = False). Confirm that reading from the employee_skill table (fields: employee_id, skill_name, level, skill_type) does not violate any salary or HR notes restrictions and is permitted for this user. Do not attempt to access any salary or hr_notes fields. The outcome should explicitly state whether the user is allowed to proceed with reading her own skills and aggregating distinct skill_name values from all employees.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["allowed","reason"]}
