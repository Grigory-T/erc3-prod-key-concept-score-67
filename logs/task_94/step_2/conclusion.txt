Successfully executed Step 2. I called who_am_i() to verify the user's identity and permissions. The output confirmed: user SrwB_017 is authenticated (is_public=False), belongs to Sales & Customer Success department, Munich Office – Germany. According to company rules, authenticated employees can read their own skills via chatbot (skills are in context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)), and reading distinct skill names from all employees for aggregation is permitted as it does not access protected fields like salary or HR notes. No state-changing operations were performed; only read operations.

{
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "User SrwB_017 is authenticated (is_public=False) and permitted to read own skills and aggregate global skill names per company rules (skills are in allowed fields for all employees via chatbot, and reading distinct skill names does not violate salary/HR notes restrictions)."
}
