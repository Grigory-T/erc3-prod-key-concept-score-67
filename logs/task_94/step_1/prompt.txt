Step 1: Resolve the current authenticated user 'SrwB_017' to an employee record in the employee table in order to know which skills belong to this user.
Approach: Use the bound user context (id 'SrwB_017', name 'Mia Hoffmann', department 'Sales & Customer Success', location 'Munich Office – Germany') to search the employee table. First attempt an exact match on employee.id = 'SrwB_017'. If no exact match is found, perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search using variations of the user identifier, full name, and email (if available): normalize strings to lowercase, trim whitespace, check substring containment (using logic similar to Python 'in' operator), then use fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) on employee.name and employee.email and, as a last resort, list all employees and try to identify the best candidate by similarity. Account for possible typos, misspellings, or formatting differences in the employee identifier or name.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_found":{"type":"boolean"},"matching_strategy":{"type":"string"},"candidate_employee_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_found","candidate_employee_ids"]}
