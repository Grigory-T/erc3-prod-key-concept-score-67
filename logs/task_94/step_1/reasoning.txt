We are given the current user context: id "SrwB_017", name "Mia Hoffmann", department "Sales & Customer Success", location "Munich Office – Germany".
 We need to find the employee record for this user in the employee table.
 Approach:
 1. First, try an exact match on employee.id = 'SrwB_017'.
 2. If not found, we will perform a fuzzy/semantic search using variations of the user identifier, full name, etc.
 3. We'll normalize strings and check substring containment, then use fuzzy matching.
 4. As a last resort, list all employees and try to identify the best candidate by similarity.

 Steps:
 - Check exact match by calling get_employee with the exact id.
 - If found, we can return the employee_id and mark found.
 - If not found, we will search by name, then by other attributes, and then use fuzzy matching.

 However, note that the user is authenticated and the context says the id is 'SrwB_017'. It is likely that the employee exists with that id.

 But we must follow the step: try exact, then fuzzy, then list all.

 Let's proceed.

 Expected Output: 
   {
     "employee_found": true/false,
     "candidate_employee_ids": [list of candidate ids]
   }

 We are also allowed to output an object with "employee_id" and "matching_strategy", but the required fields are only "employee_found" and "candidate_employee_ids".

 However, the expected output schema also includes optional "employee_id" and "matching_strategy". We can include them.

 Steps in code:

 1. Get the exact employee by id.
 2. If found, set employee_found = True, candidate_employee_ids = [id], and matching_strategy = "exact_id".
 3. If not found, we will search by name (Mia Hoffmann) in the employee list. We can use list_employees and then search by name.
    Since we have a function search_employees, we can use query parameter which might search in name and email.
 4. We can also try fuzzy_compare on the list of employee names and the target name.

 Let's break down:

 Step 3: Use search_employees with query="Mia Hoffmann". But note: search_employees may not support full name, so we might need to list and filter.

 Alternatively, we can use list_all_employees to get all employees and then search in Python.

 However, we have a function search_employees that accepts a query string. Let's try that first.

 5. If we find exactly one match with high confidence, we can use that.

 6. If we find multiple, we can return the list of candidate ids.

 7. If we find none, we can try fuzzy matching on the entire list.

 But note: the employee id might be the same as the authenticated user id, which is provided. So we expect the exact match to work.

 Let's code accordingly.

We have successfully found the employee with exact match on ID.
 The output should follow the expected JSON schema.

The user is asking to verify that the step was completed correctly. I need to review what was done against the step requirements.

Step 1: "Resolve the current authenticated user 'SrwB_017' to an employee record... First attempt an exact match on employee.id = 'SrwB_017'."

I executed code that called `get_employee("SrwB_017")` and got an exact match. The output shows: "Exact match found: SrwB_017 - Mia Hoffmann". So employee_found is true.

The expected output JSON includes employee_id, employee_found, matching_strategy, candidate_employee_ids.

I provided:
- employee_id: "SrwB_017"
- employee_found: True
- matching_strategy: "exact_id"
- candidate_employee_ids: ["SrwB_017"]

All values were explicitly printed from function returns. The code printed the employee details from the get_employee call.

I did not skip any actions: I attempted exact match, and since it was found, I did not need to do fuzzy/semantic search. The step says "First attempt an exact match... If no exact match is found, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search". Since exact match was found, no further search was needed. That's correct.

I did not change any state; only read operations (get_employee, list_all_employees were called but only after the exact match failed? Wait: In the code, I called list_all_employees only if exact match failed. Since exact match succeeded, list_all_employees was not called. The code structure: first get_employee, if found, result is set; else, do other searches. So only get_employee was called. That's fine.

All facts verified: The employee record was retrieved and printed. No assumptions made.

Thus, the step is complete. I should provide the same final_answer and json as before.

But the verification asks: "If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks." So I'll repeat them.
