## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for 'BalkanMetal' in the customer table.
Approach: Query the customer table to find the customer corresponding to 'BalkanMetal'. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name and customer.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by checking if the normalized search string 'balkanmetal' is contained within the normalized (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) customer.name or customer.id. If still not found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searches (including handling possible misspellings, spacing variations like 'Balkan Metal', and related semantic naming such as 'Balkan Metal Industries') using fuzzy string comparison and semantic similarity over customer.name and customer.brief. Rank all matches by confidence, and consider all candidates above a chosen threshold as potential matches. Do not decide on permissions here; only identify candidate customer records and their match confidence.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_customers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["customer_found", "matched_customers"] }
**Result:** I have verified Step 1 by executing a comprehensive search following the exact approach specified:

1. **Exact match**: Checked all 21 customers for exact match on customer.name or customer.id equal to 'BalkanMetal' - no exact match found.

2. **Contains normalized search string**: Checked if normalized 'balkanmetal' (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) is contained within normalized customer.name or customer.id. Found 1 match: "BalkanMetal Fabrication" (ID: cust_balkanmetal_fabrication).

3. **Fuzzy and semantic searches**: Applied fuzzy string comparison and semantic matching for variations like 'Balkan Metal', checked customer briefs, and considered partial matches. This identified "BalkanRail Components" (ID: cust_balkan_rail_components) with 70% confidence due to containing "balkan".

4. **Confidence ranking**: Only customers with confidence ≥70% were included as potential matches. The search yielded 2 customers with confidence scores of 95% and 70% respectively.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification - only read operations were used to query customer data.

The most likely match for 'BalkanMetal' is "BalkanMetal Fabrication" with 95% confidence, as it contains the normalized search term in its name.

{
  "customer_found": true,
  "matched_customers": [
    {
      "id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "name": "BalkanMetal Fabrication",
      "match_confidence": 95
    },
    {
      "id": "cust_balkan_rail_components", 
      "name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "match_confidence": 70
    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the specific project related to the 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial' for the identified BalkanMetal customer in the project table.
Approach: Using the customer.id values from Step 1 (prioritizing the highest-confidence BalkanMetal match), query the project table for projects with matching customer_id. Within those projects, search for the project whose name or description corresponds to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'. First, attempt exact and partial substring matches on normalized project.name and project.id (e.g., checking for 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial', 'zinc rich primer', 'primer fabrication', etc.). If no clear single match is found, use **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on project.name and project.description to account for possible typos, reordered words, abbreviations (such as 'Zn-rich primer trial'), and similar terminology. Rank all candidate projects by a match confidence score. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; simply return all candidate projects and their confidence scores, flagging if the result is ambiguous (multiple plausible matches) or if no plausible project is found.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "description": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "customer_id", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["project_found", "ambiguous", "matched_projects"] }
**Result:** I have verified my execution of Step 2 and confirmed the results. Here's what I verified:

1. **Followed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Used the customer IDs from Step 1: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (95% confidence) and `cust_balkan_rail_components` (70% confidence)
   - Queried the project table for projects with matching customer_id (found 3 projects total)
   - Searched within those projects for one corresponding to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'
   - Used exact and partial substring matching first, then verified with fuzzy/semantic matching

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Projects for BalkanMetal customers: 3
   - Project 1: "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`
   - Project 2: "Bogie component coating system" (ID: `proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system`) - Customer: `cust_balkan_rail_components`
   - Project 3: "Workshop coating standards and training" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`

3. **Detailed matching analysis**:
   - **Project 1**: Contains 5 out of 6 key search terms (zinc, rich, primer, fabrication, trial) - 83% term match
   - **Project 2**: Contains 0 out of 6 key search terms - 0% match
   - **Project 3**: Contains only "fabrication" out of 6 key terms - 16% match

4. **Additional verification**:
   - Checked ALL 36 projects for any zinc/primer related projects
   - Found only 1 project in the entire system containing both "zinc" and "primer" terms
   - This project is the same one identified above (`proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`)

5. **Confidence calculation correction**:
   In my initial execution, I reported 100% confidence. After verification, the project doesn't contain the EXACT phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial" but contains all the key components: "zinc-rich primer trial" + "fabrication line". The term match is 83% (5/6 terms). Given the semantic match and the project description clearly indicating a "trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures", I'm adjusting the confidence to 95% to reflect the strong but not perfect match.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The result is unambiguous - only one project matches the criteria for the BalkanMetal customer.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "matched_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "description": "Trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures.",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "match_confidence": 95
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Viola Messina, id 'Bhwa_001') to read customer and project information, including account manager and project lead details, after the relevant customer and project candidates are known.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup using the bound user context for 'Bhwa_001' to retrieve her employee.id, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry (or employee table plus any role-mapping system). Using this information and the company rules, verify that reading non-sensitive customer fields (including account_manager) and project/team_member fields (including lead roles) is allowed for this internal user. Since this task only requires reading standard customer and project metadata (no salary or confidential HR notes), confirm that access is permitted for Viola as an internal employee. Do not retrieve the actual account manager or lead names here; only determine whether the user is authorized to access that information for the previously identified customer_id and project_id values.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_id": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "access_allowed": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["user_id", "department", "location", "system_roles", "access_allowed", "denial_reason"] }
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed and verified all facts from function returns:

1. **Executed who_am_i()**: Confirmed current user is Bhwa_001 (Viola Messina), department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy, is_public: False.

2. **Retrieved employee details via get_employee()**: Verified employee exists with ID Bhwa_001, name Viola Messina, location HQ – Italy, department Corporate Leadership.

3. **Attempted to retrieve system_roles**: The EmployeeFull object returned by get_employee() does not contain a system_roles attribute. No available API function returns system_roles. I verified this by checking the object attributes directly.

4. **Applied company rules for authorization**: 
   - User is authenticated internal employee (is_public: False)
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" - according to company rules, executives have full access to any project and client information
   - The requested information (customer account_manager and project lead details) is non-sensitive business metadata
   - No company rules restrict executives from reading this information

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations (who_am_i, get_employee) were executed.

All facts in the JSON output are derived directly from function returns. The system_roles array is empty because no API function returns this information, despite the step requesting it.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "access_allowed": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve the account manager of the BalkanMetal customer from the customer table, assuming access is allowed.
Approach: From the highest-confidence BalkanMetal customer record selected based on Step 1 and confirmed as accessible in Step 3, read the account_manager field (which is an employee.id). Then query the employee table with this employee.id to retrieve the non-sensitive details of the account manager: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and any confidential notes. If multiple candidate customers remain ambiguous, prepare account manager information for each candidate separately and indicate which customer each account manager corresponds to.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "customers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "customer_name": { "type": "string" }, "account_manager": { "type": ["object", "null"], "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "department": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "email"] } }, "required": ["customer_id", "customer_name", "account_manager"] } } }, "required": ["customers"] }
**Result:** Step 4 successfully completed. Retrieved account manager information for both BalkanMetal customer candidates identified in Step 1. For the highest-confidence match (BalkanMetal Fabrication), the account manager is Helene Graf (Bhwa_018). For the secondary candidate (BalkanRail Components), the account manager is Rens de Bruin (Bhwa_027). All data was obtained through read-only operations without any state changes.

{
  "customers": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "customer_name": "BalkanMetal Fabrication",
      "account_manager": {
        "employee_id": "Bhwa_018",
        "name": "Helene Graf",
        "email": "Bhwa_018@bellini.internal",
        "location": "Munich Office – Germany",
        "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
      }
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkan_rail_components",
      "customer_name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "account_manager": {
        "employee_id": "Bhwa_027",
        "name": "Rens de Bruin",
        "email": "Bhwa_027@bellini.internal",
        "location": "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
        "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
      }
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the lead(s) on the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal from the team_member and employee tables, assuming access is allowed and a project has been identified.
Approach: Using the selected project.id from Step 2 (or all plausible candidates if ambiguity remains), query the team_member table for rows where project_id equals that project.id and role equals 'Lead'. For each such team member, obtain the employee_id. Then query the employee table for these employee_id values to retrieve the non-sensitive employee details: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and confidential notes. If multiple lead entries exist for a single project, include all of them. If multiple candidate projects exist due to ambiguous matching in Step 2, return the leads for each candidate project separately, clearly associating each set of leads with its project.id and project.name.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_id": { "type": "string" }, "project_name": { "type": "string" }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "leads": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "department": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "email"] } } }, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "customer_id", "leads"] } } }, "required": ["projects"] }
**Result:** Step 5 successfully completed. I retrieved the lead(s) on the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal. The project "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer) has one lead: Vittorio Alfano (Bhwa_010) from the Sales & Customer Success department at HQ – Italy. All data was obtained through read-only operations without any state changes.

  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for 'BalkanMetal' in the customer table.
Approach: Query the customer table to find the customer corresponding to 'BalkanMetal'. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name and customer.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by checking if the normalized search string 'balkanmetal' is contained within the normalized (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) customer.name or customer.id. If still not found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searches (including handling possible misspellings, spacing variations like 'Balkan Metal', and related semantic naming such as 'Balkan Metal Industries') using fuzzy string comparison and semantic similarity over customer.name and customer.brief. Rank all matches by confidence, and consider all candidates above a chosen threshold as potential matches. Do not decide on permissions here; only identify candidate customer records and their match confidence.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_customers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["customer_found", "matched_customers"] }
**Result:** I have verified Step 1 by executing a comprehensive search following the exact approach specified:

1. **Exact match**: Checked all 21 customers for exact match on customer.name or customer.id equal to 'BalkanMetal' - no exact match found.

2. **Contains normalized search string**: Checked if normalized 'balkanmetal' (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) is contained within normalized customer.name or customer.id. Found 1 match: "BalkanMetal Fabrication" (ID: cust_balkanmetal_fabrication).

3. **Fuzzy and semantic searches**: Applied fuzzy string comparison and semantic matching for variations like 'Balkan Metal', checked customer briefs, and considered partial matches. This identified "BalkanRail Components" (ID: cust_balkan_rail_components) with 70% confidence due to containing "balkan".

4. **Confidence ranking**: Only customers with confidence ≥70% were included as potential matches. The search yielded 2 customers with confidence scores of 95% and 70% respectively.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification - only read operations were used to query customer data.

The most likely match for 'BalkanMetal' is "BalkanMetal Fabrication" with 95% confidence, as it contains the normalized search term in its name.

{
  "customer_found": true,
  "matched_customers": [
    {
      "id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",

      "id": "cust_balkan_rail_components", 
      "name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "match_confidence": 70
    }
  ]
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Locate the specific project related to the 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial' for the identified BalkanMetal customer in the project table.
Approach: Using the customer.id values from Step 1 (prioritizing the highest-confidence BalkanMetal match), query the project table for projects with matching customer_id. Within those projects, search for the project whose name or description corresponds to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'. First, attempt exact and partial substring matches on normalized project.name and project.id (e.g., checking for 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial', 'zinc rich primer', 'primer fabrication', etc.). If no clear single match is found, use **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on project.name and project.description to account for possible typos, reordered words, abbreviations (such as 'Zn-rich primer trial'), and similar terminology. Rank all candidate projects by a match confidence score. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; simply return all candidate projects and their confidence scores, flagging if the result is ambiguous (multiple plausible matches) or if no plausible project is found.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "description": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "customer_id", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["project_found", "ambiguous", "matched_projects"] }
**Result:** I have verified my execution of Step 2 and confirmed the results. Here's what I verified:

1. **Followed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Used the customer IDs from Step 1: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (95% confidence) and `cust_balkan_rail_components` (70% confidence)
   - Queried the project table for projects with matching customer_id (found 3 projects total)
   - Searched within those projects for one corresponding to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'
   - Used exact and partial substring matching first, then verified with fuzzy/semantic matching

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Projects for BalkanMetal customers: 3
   - Project 1: "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`
   - Project 2: "Bogie component coating system" (ID: `proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system`) - Customer: `cust_balkan_rail_components`
   - Project 3: "Workshop coating standards and training" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`

3. **Detailed matching analysis**:
   - **Project 1**: Contains 5 out of 6 key search terms (zinc, rich, primer, fabrication, trial) - 83% term match
   - **Project 2**: Contains 0 out of 6 key search terms - 0% match
   - **Project 3**: Contains only "fabrication" out of 6 key terms - 16% match

4. **Additional verification**:
   - Checked ALL 36 projects for any zinc/primer related projects
   - Found only 1 project in the entire system containing both "zinc" and "primer" terms
   - This project is the same one identified above (`proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`)

5. **Confidence calculation correction**:
   In my initial execution, I reported 100% confidence. After verification, the project doesn't contain the EXACT phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial" but contains all the key components: "zinc-rich primer trial" + "fabrication line". The term match is 83% (5/6 terms). Given the semantic match and the project description clearly indicating a "trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures", I'm adjusting the confidence to 95% to reflect the strong but not perfect match.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The result is unambiguous - only one project matches the criteria for the BalkanMetal customer.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "ambiguous": false,
  "matched_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "description": "Trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures.",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "match_confidence": 95
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Viola Messina, id 'Bhwa_001') to read customer and project information, including account manager and project lead details, after the relevant customer and project candidates are known.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup using the bound user context for 'Bhwa_001' to retrieve her employee.id, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry (or employee table plus any role-mapping system). Using this information and the company rules, verify that reading non-sensitive customer fields (including account_manager) and project/team_member fields (including lead roles) is allowed for this internal user. Since this task only requires reading standard customer and project metadata (no salary or confidential HR notes), confirm that access is permitted for Viola as an internal employee. Do not retrieve the actual account manager or lead names here; only determine whether the user is authorized to access that information for the previously identified customer_id and project_id values.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_id": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "access_allowed": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["user_id", "department", "location", "system_roles", "access_allowed", "denial_reason"] }
**Result:** I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed and verified all facts from function returns:

1. **Executed who_am_i()**: Confirmed current user is Bhwa_001 (Viola Messina), department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy, is_public: False.

2. **Retrieved employee details via get_employee()**: Verified employee exists with ID Bhwa_001, name Viola Messina, location HQ – Italy, department Corporate Leadership.

3. **Attempted to retrieve system_roles**: The EmployeeFull object returned by get_employee() does not contain a system_roles attribute. No available API function returns system_roles. I verified this by checking the object attributes directly.

4. **Applied company rules for authorization**: 
   - User is authenticated internal employee (is_public: False)
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" - according to company rules, executives have full access to any project and client information
   - The requested information (customer account_manager and project lead details) is non-sensitive business metadata
   - No company rules restrict executives from reading this information

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations (who_am_i, get_employee) were executed.

All facts in the JSON output are derived directly from function returns. The system_roles array is empty because no API function returns this information, despite the step requesting it.

{
  "user_id": "Bhwa_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "access_allowed": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Retrieve the account manager of the BalkanMetal customer from the customer table, assuming access is allowed.
Approach: From the highest-confidence BalkanMetal customer record selected based on Step 1 and confirmed as accessible in Step 3, read the account_manager field (which is an employee.id). Then query the employee table with this employee.id to retrieve the non-sensitive details of the account manager: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and any confidential notes. If multiple candidate customers remain ambiguous, prepare account manager information for each candidate separately and indicate which customer each account manager corresponds to.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "customers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "customer_name": { "type": "string" }, "account_manager": { "type": ["object", "null"], "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "department": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "email"] } }, "required": ["customer_id", "customer_name", "account_manager"] } } }, "required": ["customers"] }
**Result:** Step 4 successfully completed. Retrieved account manager information for both BalkanMetal customer candidates identified in Step 1. For the highest-confidence match (BalkanMetal Fabrication), the account manager is Helene Graf (Bhwa_018). For the secondary candidate (BalkanRail Components), the account manager is Rens de Bruin (Bhwa_027). All data was obtained through read-only operations without any state changes.

{
  "customers": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "customer_name": "BalkanMetal Fabrication",
      "account_manager": {
        "employee_id": "Bhwa_018",
        "name": "Helene Graf",
        "email": "Bhwa_018@bellini.internal",
        "location": "Munich Office – Germany",
        "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
      }
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_balkan_rail_components",
      "customer_name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "account_manager": {
        "employee_id": "Bhwa_027",
        "name": "Rens de Bruin",
        "email": "Bhwa_027@bellini.internal",
        "location": "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
        "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
      }
    }
  ]
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Determine the lead(s) on the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal from the team_member and employee tables, assuming access is allowed and a project has been identified.
Approach: Using the selected project.id from Step 2 (or all plausible candidates if ambiguity remains), query the team_member table for rows where project_id equals that project.id and role equals 'Lead'. For each such team member, obtain the employee_id. Then query the employee table for these employee_id values to retrieve the non-sensitive employee details: name, email, location, and department, explicitly excluding salary and confidential notes. If multiple lead entries exist for a single project, include all of them. If multiple candidate projects exist due to ambiguous matching in Step 2, return the leads for each candidate project separately, clearly associating each set of leads with its project.id and project.name.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_id": { "type": "string" }, "project_name": { "type": "string" }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "leads": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "employee_id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "email": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "department": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "email"] } } }, "required": ["project_id", "project_name", "customer_id", "leads"] } } }, "required": ["projects"] }
**Result:** Step 5 successfully completed. I retrieved the lead(s) on the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project for BalkanMetal. The project "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer) has one lead: Vittorio Alfano (Bhwa_010) from the Sales & Customer Success department at HQ – Italy. All data was obtained through read-only operations without any state changes.

{
  "projects": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer",
      "project_name": "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line",
      "customer_id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "leads": [
        {
          "employee_id": "Bhwa_010",
          "name": "Vittorio Alfano",
          "email": "Bhwa_010@bellini.internal",
          "location": "HQ – Italy",
          "department": "Sales & Customer Success"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

### Final Result
The account manager for BalkanMetal Fabrication (the customer in the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial) is Helene Graf (Bhwa_018), located at the Munich Office, Sales & Customer Success department. The lead on the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial project ('Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line') is Vittorio Alfano (Bhwa_010), located at HQ – Italy, also with Sales & Customer Success. All required information has been retrieved and the task is fully complete.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).

  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-20
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_001
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
