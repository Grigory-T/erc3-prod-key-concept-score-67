Step 3: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Viola Messina, id 'Bhwa_001') to read customer and project information, including account manager and project lead details, after the relevant customer and project candidates are known.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent identity lookup using the bound user context for 'Bhwa_001' to retrieve her employee.id, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry (or employee table plus any role-mapping system). Using this information and the company rules, verify that reading non-sensitive customer fields (including account_manager) and project/team_member fields (including lead roles) is allowed for this internal user. Since this task only requires reading standard customer and project metadata (no salary or confidential HR notes), confirm that access is permitted for Viola as an internal employee. Do not retrieve the actual account manager or lead names here; only determine whether the user is authorized to access that information for the previously identified customer_id and project_id values.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "user_id": { "type": "string" }, "department": { "type": "string" }, "location": { "type": "string" }, "system_roles": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } }, "access_allowed": { "type": "boolean" }, "denial_reason": { "type": ["string", "null"] } }, "required": ["user_id", "department", "location", "system_roles", "access_allowed", "denial_reason"] }
