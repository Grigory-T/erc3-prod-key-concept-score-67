STEP 3 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-09 21:14:46

I have executed Step 3 exactly as instructed and verified all facts from function returns:

1. **Executed who_am_i()**: Confirmed current user is Bhwa_001 (Viola Messina), department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy, is_public: False.

2. **Retrieved employee details via get_employee()**: Verified employee exists with ID Bhwa_001, name Viola Messina, location HQ – Italy, department Corporate Leadership.

3. **Attempted to retrieve system_roles**: The EmployeeFull object returned by get_employee() does not contain a system_roles attribute. No available API function returns system_roles. I verified this by checking the object attributes directly.

4. **Applied company rules for authorization**: 
   - User is authenticated internal employee (is_public: False)
   - Department is "Corporate Leadership" - according to company rules, executives have full access to any project and client information
   - The requested information (customer account_manager and project lead details) is non-sensitive business metadata
   - No company rules restrict executives from reading this information

5. **No state-changing operations performed**: Only read operations (who_am_i, get_employee) were executed.

All facts in the JSON output are derived directly from function returns. The system_roles array is empty because no API function returns this information, despite the step requesting it.
