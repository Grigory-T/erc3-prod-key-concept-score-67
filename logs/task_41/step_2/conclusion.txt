STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

I have verified my execution of Step 2 and confirmed the results. Here's what I verified:

1. **Followed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Used the customer IDs from Step 1: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (95% confidence) and `cust_balkan_rail_components` (70% confidence)
   - Queried the project table for projects with matching customer_id (found 3 projects total)
   - Searched within those projects for one corresponding to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'
   - Used exact and partial substring matching first, then verified with fuzzy/semantic matching

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Projects for BalkanMetal customers: 3
   - Project 1: "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`
   - Project 2: "Bogie component coating system" (ID: `proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system`) - Customer: `cust_balkan_rail_components`
   - Project 3: "Workshop coating standards and training" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`

3. **Detailed matching analysis**:
   - **Project 1**: Contains 5 out of 6 key search terms (zinc, rich, primer, fabrication, trial) - 83% term match
   - **Project 2**: Contains 0 out of 6 key search terms - 0% match
   - **Project 3**: Contains only "fabrication" out of 6 key terms - 16% match

4. **Additional verification**:
   - Checked ALL 36 projects for any zinc/primer related projects
   - Found only 1 project in the entire system containing both "zinc" and "primer" terms
   - This project is the same one identified above (`proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`)

5. **Confidence calculation correction**:
   In my initial execution, I reported 100% confidence. After verification, the project doesn't contain the EXACT phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial" but contains all the key components: "zinc-rich primer trial" + "fabrication line". The term match is 83% (5/6 terms). Given the semantic match and the project description clearly indicating a "trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures", I'm adjusting the confidence to 95% to reflect the strong but not perfect match.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The result is unambiguous - only one project matches the criteria for the BalkanMetal customer.
