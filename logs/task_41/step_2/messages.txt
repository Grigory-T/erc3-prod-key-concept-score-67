## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-08-20
Current actor: Authenticated user Bhwa_001
User details: {"id": "Bhwa_001", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Who is account manager of customer in zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for BalkanMetal? Also who is the lead on that project?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the correct customer record for 'BalkanMetal' in the customer table.
Approach: Query the customer table to find the customer corresponding to 'BalkanMetal'. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name and customer.id. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search by checking if the normalized search string 'balkanmetal' is contained within the normalized (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) customer.name or customer.id. If still not found, perform **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** searches (including handling possible misspellings, spacing variations like 'Balkan Metal', and related semantic naming such as 'Balkan Metal Industries') using fuzzy string comparison and semantic similarity over customer.name and customer.brief. Rank all matches by confidence, and consider all candidates above a chosen threshold as potential matches. Do not decide on permissions here; only identify candidate customer records and their match confidence.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "customer_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_customers": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["customer_found", "matched_customers"] }
**Result:** I have verified Step 1 by executing a comprehensive search following the exact approach specified:

1. **Exact match**: Checked all 21 customers for exact match on customer.name or customer.id equal to 'BalkanMetal' - no exact match found.

2. **Contains normalized search string**: Checked if normalized 'balkanmetal' (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) is contained within normalized customer.name or customer.id. Found 1 match: "BalkanMetal Fabrication" (ID: cust_balkanmetal_fabrication).

3. **Fuzzy and semantic searches**: Applied fuzzy string comparison and semantic matching for variations like 'Balkan Metal', checked customer briefs, and considered partial matches. This identified "BalkanRail Components" (ID: cust_balkan_rail_components) with 70% confidence due to containing "balkan".

4. **Confidence ranking**: Only customers with confidence ≥70% were included as potential matches. The search yielded 2 customers with confidence scores of 95% and 70% respectively.

No state-changing operations were performed during this verification - only read operations were used to query customer data.

The most likely match for 'BalkanMetal' is "BalkanMetal Fabrication" with 95% confidence, as it contains the normalized search term in its name.

{
  "customer_found": true,
  "matched_customers": [
    {
      "id": "cust_balkanmetal_fabrication",
      "name": "BalkanMetal Fabrication",
      "match_confidence": 95
    },
    {
      "id": "cust_balkan_rail_components", 
      "name": "BalkanRail Components",
      "match_confidence": 70
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Locate the specific project related to the 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial' for the identified BalkanMetal customer in the project table.
Approach: Using the customer.id values from Step 1 (prioritizing the highest-confidence BalkanMetal match), query the project table for projects with matching customer_id. Within those projects, search for the project whose name or description corresponds to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'. First, attempt exact and partial substring matches on normalized project.name and project.id (e.g., checking for 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial', 'zinc rich primer', 'primer fabrication', etc.). If no clear single match is found, use **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on project.name and project.description to account for possible typos, reordered words, abbreviations (such as 'Zn-rich primer trial'), and similar terminology. Rank all candidate projects by a match confidence score. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; simply return all candidate projects and their confidence scores, flagging if the result is ambiguous (multiple plausible matches) or if no plausible project is found.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "description": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "customer_id", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["project_found", "ambiguous", "matched_projects"] }

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 2 to locate the specific project related to the 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial' for the identified BalkanMetal customer. Following the approach specified in the step description:

1. **Used customer IDs from Step 1**: Started with the two customer IDs identified in Step 1: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (95% confidence) and `cust_balkan_rail_components` (70% confidence).

2. **Filtered projects by customer**: Searched through all 36 projects and found 3 projects belonging to the specified customers.

3. **Exact and partial substring matching**: Searched for the project using the search phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial" and its variations. Found one exact match with 100% confidence.

4. **No fuzzy matching needed**: Since an exact match was found with high confidence, no further fuzzy or semantic matching was required.

The search identified exactly one project that matches the criteria, making the result unambiguous. The project is clearly related to the zinc-rich primer fabrication trial for the BalkanMetal customer.

No state-changing operations were performed during this step - only read operations to query project data.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Locate the specific project related to the 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial' for the identified BalkanMetal customer in the project table.
Approach: Using the customer.id values from Step 1 (prioritizing the highest-confidence BalkanMetal match), query the project table for projects with matching customer_id. Within those projects, search for the project whose name or description corresponds to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'. First, attempt exact and partial substring matches on normalized project.name and project.id (e.g., checking for 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial', 'zinc rich primer', 'primer fabrication', etc.). If no clear single match is found, use **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** matching on project.name and project.description to account for possible typos, reordered words, abbreviations (such as 'Zn-rich primer trial'), and similar terminology. Rank all candidate projects by a match confidence score. Do not resolve ambiguities yet; simply return all candidate projects and their confidence scores, flagging if the result is ambiguous (multiple plausible matches) or if no plausible project is found.
Expected Output: { "type": "object", "properties": { "project_found": { "type": "boolean" }, "ambiguous": { "type": "boolean" }, "matched_projects": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "object", "properties": { "id": { "type": "string" }, "name": { "type": "string" }, "description": { "type": ["string", "null"] }, "customer_id": { "type": "string" }, "match_confidence": { "type": "number" } }, "required": ["id", "name", "customer_id", "match_confidence"] } } }, "required": ["project_found", "ambiguous", "matched_projects"] }

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have verified my execution of Step 2 and confirmed the results. Here's what I verified:

1. **Followed the step instruction exactly**: 
   - Used the customer IDs from Step 1: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication` (95% confidence) and `cust_balkan_rail_components` (70% confidence)
   - Queried the project table for projects with matching customer_id (found 3 projects total)
   - Searched within those projects for one corresponding to 'zinc-rich primer fabrication trial'
   - Used exact and partial substring matching first, then verified with fuzzy/semantic matching

2. **Verified all facts from function returns**:
   - Total projects in system: 36
   - Projects for BalkanMetal customers: 3
   - Project 1: "Zinc-rich primer trial for fabrication line" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`
   - Project 2: "Bogie component coating system" (ID: `proj_balkanrail_bogie_component_system`) - Customer: `cust_balkan_rail_components`
   - Project 3: "Workshop coating standards and training" (ID: `proj_balkanmetal_workshop_standards`) - Customer: `cust_balkanmetal_fabrication`

3. **Detailed matching analysis**:
   - **Project 1**: Contains 5 out of 6 key search terms (zinc, rich, primer, fabrication, trial) - 83% term match
   - **Project 2**: Contains 0 out of 6 key search terms - 0% match
   - **Project 3**: Contains only "fabrication" out of 6 key terms - 16% match

4. **Additional verification**:
   - Checked ALL 36 projects for any zinc/primer related projects
   - Found only 1 project in the entire system containing both "zinc" and "primer" terms
   - This project is the same one identified above (`proj_balkanmetal_zinc_rich_primer`)

5. **Confidence calculation correction**:
   In my initial execution, I reported 100% confidence. After verification, the project doesn't contain the EXACT phrase "zinc-rich primer fabrication trial" but contains all the key components: "zinc-rich primer trial" + "fabrication line". The term match is 83% (5/6 terms). Given the semantic match and the project description clearly indicating a "trial of zinc-rich primer system for regional fabricated steel structures", I'm adjusting the confidence to 95% to reflect the strong but not perfect match.

6. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed.

The result is unambiguous - only one project matches the criteria for the BalkanMetal customer.
