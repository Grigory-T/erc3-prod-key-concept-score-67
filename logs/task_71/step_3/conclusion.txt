I have thoroughly executed step 3 to identify and retrieve the customer record for "Italian machinery OEM - Press Machina" using all required search methods:

1. **Exact match check**: No customer with the exact name "Italian machinery OEM - Press Machina" was found.

2. **Case-insensitive substring check**: Searched all 21 customers in the system, but no customer name or brief contained the complete normalized query string.

3. **Fuzzy matching**: Applied fuzzy_compare to customer names and fuzzy_find_in_text to customer briefs. Top results were:
   - By name: 'Machina Press Systems' (48.3% ratio)
   - By text: 'RhineMach Industrial GROUP' (56.8% ratio)

4. **Semantic/logical search**: Broke down the query into components: "Italian" (location), "machinery OEM" (business type), and "Press Machina" (likely company name). The best semantic match was 'Machina Press Systems' with a score of 85/100 because:
   - Located in Italy
   - Name contains both "Press" and "Machina" 
   - Brief mentions "OEM supplier of industrial presses and conveyors" (matching "OEM" and "machinery")

5. **Final selection**: After combining evidence from all methods, 'Machina Press Systems' (ID: cust_machina_press) was selected as the best match with 100% confidence after verification:
   - Location: Italy (matches "Italian")
   - Brief mentions "OEM" (matches "OEM")
   - Brief mentions "industrial presses" (matches "machinery" and "Press")

No state-changing operations were performed during this step - only read operations were used to search and retrieve customer data.
