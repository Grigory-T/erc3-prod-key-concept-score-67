Step 3: Identify and retrieve the customer record corresponding to "Italian machinery OEM - Press Machina" from the customer table in the Customer Relationship Management system, accounting for possible typos, partial matches, or variations in the name by using fuzzy and semantic or logical search.
Approach: Query the customer table first with an exact match on the name field for "Italian machinery OEM - Press Machina". If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: (1) perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks where the normalized query string is checked as a substring of the customer name and possibly the brief field; (2) use fuzzy matching functions (for example, fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) to compare "Italian machinery OEM - Press Machina" against customer.name and customer.brief, capturing top N results; (3) apply semantic or logical search to interpret parts of the name such as "Italian machinery OEM" and "Press Machina" separately, including abbreviation or ordering variations. Evaluate fuzzy scores and semantic relevance, select the best matching customer if it has sufficiently high confidence according to system defaults, and record its id and name. If no satisfactory match is found, mark found=false and matched_customer_id as null.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"input_name":{"type":"string"},"matched_customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"matched_customer_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"match_confidence":{"type":["number","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["input_name","matched_customer_id","matched_customer_name","match_confidence","found"]}
