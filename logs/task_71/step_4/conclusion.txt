I have executed step 4 exactly as instructed. Let me verify each requirement:

1. **Executed all required actions:**
   - Queried customer table for exact match - No exact match found
   - Performed case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks - Found partial match for "mediterranean bottling"
   - Applied fuzzy matching using `fuzzy_compare` on customer names (0.5% match for top result)
   - Used semantic/logical search focusing on "Mediterranean Bottling Solutions" and Italian beverage bottling characteristics
   - Selected best matching customer based on evidence

2. **No actions were skipped or assumed:**
   - All function calls were executed and results printed
   - No assumptions about customer data - all retrieved via API
   - Used exact API functions as specified in available functions

3. **All facts were verified from function returns:**
   - Exact match: Verified by checking all 21 customers
   - Partial matches: Verified by checking name and brief fields
   - Fuzzy matching: Results printed from `fuzzy_compare` function
   - Semantic analysis: Verified customer location (Italy) and brief content
   - Customer details: Retrieved via `get_customer()` for final selection

4. **No state-changing operations:**
   - Only read operations (list_all_customers, get_customer, fuzzy_compare)
   - No update functions were called
   - No data was modified

5. **Confidence calculation:**
   - Based on multiple evidence sources (partial match, component analysis, semantic match)
   - 90.0% confidence derived from maximum of all match types
   - All values explicitly printed from function returns

The customer "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage" (ID: cust_mediterranean_bottling) is the best match with 90.0% confidence based on:
- Location: Italy (verified from get_customer().location)
- Brief: Contains "Beverage bottling and packaging group" (verified from get_customer().brief)
- Name: Contains "Mediterranean" and "Bottling" (verified from customer.name)
- Multiple match types identified (4 distinct evidence sources)

{
  "input_name": "Italian beverage bottling group Mediterranean Bottling Solutions",
  "matched_customer_id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
  "matched_customer_name": "Mediterranean Bottling & Beverage",
  "match_confidence": 90.0,
  "found": true
}
