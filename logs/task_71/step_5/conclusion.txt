STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

Step 5 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed by:

1. Using the matched_customer_id values from Steps 3 and 4: "cust_machina_press" and "cust_mediterranean_bottling"
2. Querying the project table by retrieving all 36 projects from the ProjectRegistry using list_all_projects()
3. Counting projects for each customer by exact equality on customer_id (project.customer == customer_id)
4. Including all projects regardless of status (as verified by printing project statuses: active, exploring, paused)
5. Constructing the required array with customer_id and project_count for both customers

All facts were verified from function returns:
- Total projects: 36 (from list_all_projects())
- Customer 1 (cust_machina_press): 3 projects (verified by filtering and counting)
- Customer 2 (cust_mediterranean_bottling): 1 project (verified by filtering and counting)
- Customer names were verified via get_customer() calls

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations were used to count projects.

{
  "customer_project_counts": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_machina_press",
      "project_count": 3
    },
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_mediterranean_bottling",
      "project_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
