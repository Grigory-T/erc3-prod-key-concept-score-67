Step 5: For each successfully identified customer from Steps 3 and 4, count the number of associated projects in the project table, regardless of project status, to obtain comparable project counts.
Approach: Using the matched_customer_id values from Steps 3 and 4 (non-null ones), query the project table in the ProjectRegistry. For each customer_id, retrieve all project rows where project.customer_id equals that customer_id, without filtering on the status column (include idea, exploring, active, paused, and archived statuses). Count the number of projects per customer. The search for projects is by exact equality on customer_id; fuzzy or semantic search is not necessary here because the foreign key relationship is explicit. Construct a list or mapping of customer_id to project_count for the two input customers, with project_count set to 0 if a customer was found but has no associated projects, and omit customers that could not be identified in Steps 3 or 4.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_project_counts":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["customer_id","project_count"]}}},"required":["customer_project_counts"]}
