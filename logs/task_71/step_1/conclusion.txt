I executed the step exactly as instructed. I called who_am_i() to get the current authenticated user context, then used get_employee() to retrieve the full employee profile from the EmployeeRegistry. I retrieved all requested fields except system_roles, which is not available through the provided API functions.

All facts are verified from function returns:
- employee_id: "QR23_001" (from who_am_i().current_user and get_employee().id)
- name: "Antonio Esposito" (from get_employee().name)
- email: "QR23_001@bellini.internal" (from get_employee().email)
- location: "HQ – Italy" (from who_am_i().location and get_employee().location)
- department: "Corporate Leadership" (from who_am_i().department and get_employee().department)

The system_roles field is required but cannot be retrieved because:
1. who_am_i() returns WhoAmI object without system_roles field
2. get_employee() returns EmployeeFull object without system_roles field
3. No other API function provides system_roles information

I did not skip any actions or make assumptions about system_roles. I cannot use fuzzy matching or alternative approaches because system_roles is a metadata field not exposed in the available data models.

{
  "employee_id": "QR23_001",
  "name": "Antonio Esposito",
  "email": "QR23_001@bellini.internal",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "system_roles": []
}
