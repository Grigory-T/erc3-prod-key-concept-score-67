Step 1: Retrieve the current authenticated employee profile (user QR23_001) and bound identity details from the EmployeeRegistry, including department, location, and system roles, using a who_am_i-style function.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity or EmployeeRegistry service (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) to fetch the profile for the currently authenticated user (internally identified as QR23_001). Do not log extra information. Only retrieve fields that are necessary for permission checks: employee id, name, email, location, department, and system_roles. No salary or confidential human resources notes should be requested. No fuzzy or semantic search is needed here because the identity is determined by the authenticated session and not by a free-text query.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"email":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","name","email","location","department","system_roles"]}
