Completed: 2025-12-09 22:40:44

I have executed Step 2 exactly as instructed:

1. **Executed the required actions:**
   - Called `who_am_i()` to get current user context
   - Tested read access to customer data by calling `list_customers()`
   - Tested read access to project data by calling `list_projects()`
   - Retrieved employee profile using `get_employee()` to verify field access

2. **No actions were skipped or assumed:**
   - All function calls were executed and their results printed
   - No assumptions were made about permissions - I tested actual access
   - Used exact API functions as specified in available functions

3. **All facts were verified from function returns:**
   - User is authenticated: `is_public=False` from `who_am_i()`
   - User department: "Corporate Leadership" from `who_am_i().department`
   - Customer read access: Successfully retrieved 1 customer via `list_customers()`
   - Project read access: Successfully retrieved 1 project via `list_projects()`
   - Employee profile access: Successfully retrieved own profile with `get_employee()`

4. **No state-changing operations were performed:**
   - Only read operations (list_customers, list_projects, get_employee)
   - No update functions were called
   - No data was modified

5. **Authorization analysis based on verified facts:**
   - The user is authenticated (not public)
   - The user belongs to Corporate Leadership department
   - Read operations for customers and projects succeeded without errors
   - No company rules explicitly restrict READ access to customer/project data
   - The company rules focus on write/mutation operations, not read operations

Therefore, the user QR23_001 is authorized to read customer and project data to compute aggregate project counts per customer.

{
  "authorized": true,
  "reason": "User is authenticated and in Corporate Leadership department. Read operations for customers (list_customers) and projects (list_projects) succeeded without errors, indicating authorized access. No company rules restrict read access to customer/project data for authenticated users."
}
