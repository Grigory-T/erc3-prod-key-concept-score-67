Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (from Step 1) to ensure they are allowed to read customer and project data and compute aggregate project counts per customer.
Approach: Using the employee_id, department, location, and system_roles from Step 1, evaluate whether the user is allowed to read customer and project records in the Customer Relationship Management and ProjectRegistry systems respectively. The user is in Corporate Leadership, which typically has broad read access, but this must be explicitly checked via a backend_permission_check or equivalent authorization mechanism for read operations on customer and project entities. Confirm that no restricted fields such as salary or confidential human resources information are accessed. If authorization is denied for reading customers or projects, set authorized=false and this plan would later need to abort; otherwise set authorized=true.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"authorized":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["authorized","reason"]}
