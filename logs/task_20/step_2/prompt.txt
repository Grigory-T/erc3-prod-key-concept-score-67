Step 2: Identify the current actor (who_am_i) and check permissions to ensure a public, unauthenticated user is allowed to receive high-level office location information.
Approach: Use the current context (current actor is GUEST / Anonymous, is_public = true) to perform a conceptual who_am_i check and verify that the request concerns only neutral, publicly shareable information (overall office locations) and does not require access to restricted systems such as Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, or internal wiki. Confirm that sharing whether the company operates in certain cities or offices is permitted for a public user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"is_public":{"type":"boolean"},"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["is_public","allowed","reason"]}
