Step 2 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed:

1. Called `who_am_i()` to identify the current actor
2. Verified from the function return that the user is public/unauthenticated (is_public=True, current_user='')
3. Checked permissions by evaluating that the request is for publicly available office location information
4. Confirmed this doesn't require access to restricted systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki)

All facts were verified from function returns:
- is_public value came from `who_am_i()` return
- allowed decision based on company rules about public information
- reason explains why this specific request is permitted

No state-changing operations were performed. No assumptions were made about company locations beyond what was provided in the initial context.

{
  "is_public": true,
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "Request is for publicly available office location information only; does not require access to restricted internal systems."
}
