Step 1: Understand the user question and define the exact decision rule: determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in either Tokyo or in Paris Office – France, and prepare to answer "Yes" if at least one of these locations is present among company locations, otherwise "No".
Approach: Parse the user request textually to extract the locations of interest ("Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France") and formalize the decision rule as: if company_locations contains "Tokyo" OR contains "Paris Office – France" (using case-insensitive comparison and allowing for fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or formatting variations), then result = "Yes"; else result = "No". Do not access any systems yet; this step only clarifies logic.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations_of_interest":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"decision_rule":{"type":"string"}},"required":["locations_of_interest","decision_rule"]}
