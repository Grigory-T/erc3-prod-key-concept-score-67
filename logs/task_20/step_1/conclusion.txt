I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. The step required only understanding the user question and defining the decision rule without accessing any systems. I parsed the user request to extract the two locations of interest ("Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France") and formalized a clear decision rule. No systems were accessed, no assumptions were made about company locations beyond what was provided in the initial context, and no state-changing operations were performed. The output matches the expected JSON schema.

Note: This step only defines the logic without accessing any systems.

{
  "locations_of_interest": ["Tokyo", "Paris Office – France"],
  "decision_rule": "Check if the company's locations (from initial context: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy, Serbian Factory, Munich Office, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office, Barcelona Office, Vienna Office) contain at least one of the locations_of_interest. Use case-insensitive matching. If 'Paris Office – France' is present (exact match or semantic equivalent), or 'Tokyo' is present (exact or fuzzy match), answer 'Yes'. Otherwise answer 'No'."
}
