## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Understand the user question and define the exact decision rule: determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in either Tokyo or in Paris Office – France, and prepare to answer "Yes" if at least one of these locations is present among company locations, otherwise "No".
Approach: Parse the user request textually to extract the locations of interest ("Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France") and formalize the decision rule as: if company_locations contains "Tokyo" OR contains "Paris Office – France" (using case-insensitive comparison and allowing for fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or formatting variations), then result = "Yes"; else result = "No". Do not access any systems yet; this step only clarifies logic.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations_of_interest":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"decision_rule":{"type":"string"}},"required":["locations_of_interest","decision_rule"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 exactly as instructed. The step required only understanding the user question and defining the decision rule without accessing any systems. I parsed the user request to extract the two locations of interest ("Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France") and formalized a clear decision rule. No systems were accessed, no assumptions were made about company locations beyond what was provided in the initial context, and no state-changing operations were performed. The output matches the expected JSON schema.

Note: This step only defines the logic without accessing any systems.

{
  "locations_of_interest": ["Tokyo", "Paris Office – France"],
  "decision_rule": "Check if the company's locations (from initial context: Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy, Serbian Factory, Munich Office, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office, Barcelona Office, Vienna Office) contain at least one of the locations_of_interest. Use case-insensitive matching. If 'Paris Office – France' is present (exact match or semantic equivalent), or 'Tokyo' is present (exact or fuzzy match), answer 'Yes'. Otherwise answer 'No'."
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the current actor (who_am_i) and check permissions to ensure a public, unauthenticated user is allowed to receive high-level office location information.
Approach: Use the current context (current actor is GUEST / Anonymous, is_public = true) to perform a conceptual who_am_i check and verify that the request concerns only neutral, publicly shareable information (overall office locations) and does not require access to restricted systems such as Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, or internal wiki. Confirm that sharing whether the company operates in certain cities or offices is permitted for a public user.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"is_public":{"type":"boolean"},"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["is_public","allowed","reason"]}
**Result:** Step 2 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed:

1. Called `who_am_i()` to identify the current actor
2. Verified from the function return that the user is public/unauthenticated (is_public=True, current_user='')
3. Checked permissions by evaluating that the request is for publicly available office location information
4. Confirmed this doesn't require access to restricted systems (CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking, InternalWiki)

All facts were verified from function returns:
- is_public value came from `who_am_i()` return
- allowed decision based on company rules about public information
- reason explains why this specific request is permitted

No state-changing operations were performed. No assumptions were made about company locations beyond what was provided in the initial context.

{
  "is_public": true,
  "allowed": true,
  "reason": "Request is for publicly available office location information only; does not require access to restricted internal systems."
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Retrieve the list of Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations from the provided company context to know all known operating sites.
Approach: From the given company description in the task context, extract the Locations list (Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria). Treat this as authoritative for the purposes of this question. Ensure the extraction is robust by using case-insensitive, fuzzy, and semantic / logical parsing so that formatting characters such as dashes, capitalization, and spacing do not cause missed entries.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["locations"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed by extracting the company locations from the provided company context in the task description. I parsed the "Locations:" field from the initial context, handled the comma-separated list while properly recombining the "Serbian Factory" location that contained an internal comma. All 7 locations were extracted exactly as presented in the original context. No systems were accessed, no assumptions were made, and all facts were verified by examining the exact text from the company description. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "locations": [
    "Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo)",
    "Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia",
    "Munich Office – Germany",
    "Paris Office – France",
    "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
    "Barcelona Office – Spain",
    "Vienna Office – Austria"
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether any of the extracted company locations match either "Tokyo" or "Paris Office – France" using case-insensitive, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching.
Approach: Normalize all extracted locations and the target strings ("Tokyo", "Paris Office – France") to a standard form (for example, lowercase, trimmed whitespace, normalized punctuation). First attempt exact substring checks; if not found, apply fuzzy matching (allowing for misspellings and minor differences) and semantic / logical checks (e.g., matching "paris" and country "france" in the same location string). Determine two booleans: tokyo_present and paris_present.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"tokyo_present":{"type":"boolean"},"paris_present":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["tokyo_present","paris_present"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed by checking all company locations against "Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France" using multiple matching techniques:

1. Normalized all strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
2. Performed exact substring checks: Tokyo not found, Paris found
3. Applied fuzzy matching: Tokyo showed very low similarity ratios (all < 16%), Paris showed exact match (100% ratio)
4. Applied semantic/logical checks: Confirmed "paris" and "france" appear together in the same location string

All facts were verified from function returns (fuzzy_compare results printed). No state-changing operations were performed. No assumptions were made - all conclusions are based on explicit verification.

{
  "tokyo_present": false,
  "paris_present": true
}

### Final Result
Yes. Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in Paris Office – France, but does not operate in Tokyo.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPANY POLICIES CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUST APPLY: Public responses must mention the company name 'Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A.' somewhere in the message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user is not requesting any critical or destructive action such as data deletion.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The functionality (checking presence of offices in specific cities) is available; the system supports answering this query.

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user is requesting only high-level, publicly available company location information. No restricted system or permission is required for this public data.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user provided all required information: the cities in question and what answer format is expected.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user’s task is clear: determine if the company operates in either Tokyo or Paris Office – France.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: There is no indication of a technical system error in the agent's response.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: While 'Tokyo' was not found in the company’s locations, 'Paris Office – France' was found; thus, objects to answer the question exist.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: The system had all the needed data. The agent correctly followed steps to check, found 'Paris Office – France' in company locations, and answered as requested.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

# Current Context
Date: 2025-06-20
Current actor: GUEST (Anonymous/Public user)

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
