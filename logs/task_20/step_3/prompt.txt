Step 3: Retrieve the list of Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations from the provided company context to know all known operating sites.
Approach: From the given company description in the task context, extract the Locations list (Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria). Treat this as authoritative for the purposes of this question. Ensure the extraction is robust by using case-insensitive, fuzzy, and semantic / logical parsing so that formatting characters such as dashes, capitalization, and spacing do not cause missed entries.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["locations"]}
