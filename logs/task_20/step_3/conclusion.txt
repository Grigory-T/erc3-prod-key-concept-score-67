Step 3 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed by extracting the company locations from the provided company context in the task description. I parsed the "Locations:" field from the initial context, handled the comma-separated list while properly recombining the "Serbian Factory" location that contained an internal comma. All 7 locations were extracted exactly as presented in the original context. No systems were accessed, no assumptions were made, and all facts were verified by examining the exact text from the company description. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "locations": [
    "Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo)",
    "Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia",
    "Munich Office – Germany",
    "Paris Office – France",
    "Rotterdam Office – Netherlands",
    "Barcelona Office – Spain",
    "Vienna Office – Austria"
