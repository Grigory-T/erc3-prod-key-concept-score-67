Steps:
  1. Understand the user question and define the exact decision rule: determine if Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. operates in either Tokyo or in Paris Office – France, and prepare to answer "Yes" if at least one of these locations is present among company locations, otherwise "No".
     Approach: Parse the user request textually to extract the locations of interest ("Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France") and formalize the decision rule as: if company_locations contains "Tokyo" OR contains "Paris Office – France" (using case-insensitive comparison and allowing for fuzzy and semantic / logical matching to account for typos or formatting variations), then result = "Yes"; else result = "No". Do not access any systems yet; this step only clarifies logic.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations_of_interest":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"decision_rule":{"type":"string"}},"required":["locations_of_interest","decision_rule"]}
  2. Identify the current actor (who_am_i) and check permissions to ensure a public, unauthenticated user is allowed to receive high-level office location information.
     Approach: Use the current context (current actor is GUEST / Anonymous, is_public = true) to perform a conceptual who_am_i check and verify that the request concerns only neutral, publicly shareable information (overall office locations) and does not require access to restricted systems such as Customer Relationship Management, Project Registry, Employee Registry, Time Tracking, or internal wiki. Confirm that sharing whether the company operates in certain cities or offices is permitted for a public user.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"is_public":{"type":"boolean"},"allowed":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["is_public","allowed","reason"]}
  3. Retrieve the list of Bellini Industria Vernici S.p.A. locations from the provided company context to know all known operating sites.
     Approach: From the given company description in the task context, extract the Locations list (Headquarters & Italian Factory – Northern Italy (between Milan and Bergamo), Serbian Factory – near Novi Sad, northern Serbia, Munich Office – Germany, Paris Office – France, Rotterdam Office – Netherlands, Barcelona Office – Spain, Vienna Office – Austria). Treat this as authoritative for the purposes of this question. Ensure the extraction is robust by using case-insensitive, fuzzy, and semantic / logical parsing so that formatting characters such as dashes, capitalization, and spacing do not cause missed entries.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["locations"]}
  4. Check whether any of the extracted company locations match either "Tokyo" or "Paris Office – France" using case-insensitive, fuzzy, and semantic / logical matching.
     Approach: Normalize all extracted locations and the target strings ("Tokyo", "Paris Office – France") to a standard form (for example, lowercase, trimmed whitespace, normalized punctuation). First attempt exact substring checks; if not found, apply fuzzy matching (allowing for misspellings and minor differences) and semantic / logical checks (e.g., matching "paris" and country "france" in the same location string). Determine two booleans: tokyo_present and paris_present.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"tokyo_present":{"type":"boolean"},"paris_present":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["tokyo_present","paris_present"]}
  5. Derive and state the final Yes/No answer based on the presence of Tokyo or Paris Office – France in the company locations.
     Approach: Apply the decision rule from step 1 using the booleans from step 4: if tokyo_present OR paris_present is true, set answer = "Yes"; otherwise set answer = "No". Optionally include a brief, high-level explanation referencing which of the two locations (if any) was found, without exposing any restricted internal information.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"answer":{"type":"string","enum":["Yes","No"]},"explanation":{"type":"string"}},"required":["answer"]}
