DECISION AFTER STEP 1

Time: 2025-12-09 20:03:06
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step was Step 1 (define logic and decision rule). The plan is still valid; remaining steps are straightforward, feasible, and information from the context is sufficient to continue as planned. There are no inconsistencies or evidence that would require replanning or aborting. Proceed to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:04:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have executed successfully and the plan remains valid. There are no discrepancies or unexpected results so far. The information required for Step 3 (extracting the locations from the initial context) is available in the company description, and no new risks or missing functions are present. Therefore, the plan should continue exactly as originally laid out.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:06:41
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The previous steps have proceeded exactly as planned: the decision rule has been defined, permissions for a public user have been validated, and an accurate list of company locations has been extracted from context. There are no anomalies or missing data. The next step is clearly laid out and can be executed as written to achieve the goal. There are no blockers or unplanned circumstances. Therefore, the plan remains fully valid and we should continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:08:07
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been executed according to the original plan. Step 4 determined that 'Paris Office – France' is an active company location but 'Tokyo' is not. The decision rule was to answer 'Yes' if either 'Tokyo' or 'Paris Office – France' is present among company locations. Therefore, step 5 can be executed directly as a final answer: Yes. There are no uncertainties or missing information.
