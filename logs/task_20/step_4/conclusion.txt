Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step exactly as instructed by checking all company locations against "Tokyo" and "Paris Office – France" using multiple matching techniques:

1. Normalized all strings to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
2. Performed exact substring checks: Tokyo not found, Paris found
3. Applied fuzzy matching: Tokyo showed very low similarity ratios (all < 16%), Paris showed exact match (100% ratio)
4. Applied semantic/logical checks: Confirmed "paris" and "france" appear together in the same location string

All facts were verified from function returns (fuzzy_compare results printed). No state-changing operations were performed. No assumptions were made - all conclusions are based on explicit verification.

{
  "tokyo_present": false,
  "paris_present": true
}
