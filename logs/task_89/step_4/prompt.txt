Step 4: Retrieve all project IDs for each of the two employees from the team_member table, using their resolved employee IDs to build separate sets of associated projects.
Approach: Assuming permissions are granted and each target employee has been uniquely identified by employee.id, run two SELECT queries on team_member: one filtering by employee_id equal to the resolved ID for Sarti Carlotta, and another for the resolved ID for Nino Valente. Use exact matching on employee_id (no fuzziness needed at this stage). Collect all distinct project_id values for each employee into two separate lists, which will later be intersected. If either employee has no matching rows, return an empty list for that employee.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"sarti_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"sarti_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"valente_employee_id":{"type":"string"},"valente_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["sarti_employee_id","sarti_project_ids","valente_employee_id","valente_project_ids"]}
