I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. Based on comprehensive verification through multiple methods, I confirm that neither employee has any project assignments in the team_member table. The results were obtained through:

1. **Direct team search**: Used `search_projects(team_employee=employee_id)` with pagination and `include_archived=True` to search all projects.
2. **Full project inspection**: Examined all 36 projects by retrieving each project's full team list.
3. **Verification of employee identities**: Confirmed the correct employee IDs match the target individuals.

All facts were verified through function returns with no assumptions. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "sarti_employee_id": "bAsk_149",
  "sarti_project_ids": [],
  "valente_employee_id": "bAsk_142",
  "valente_project_ids": []
}
