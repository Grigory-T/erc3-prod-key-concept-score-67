I executed the step to identify the technical implementation for listing projects where two employees are both involved. The step required using the provided SQL schema to determine tables and fields, but no explicit SQL schema was provided in the system context. Instead, I verified the data model through available API functions and object structures.

I performed the following verification actions:

1. Listed employees to confirm employee data is accessible (employee table).
2. Listed projects to confirm project data is accessible (project table).
3. Retrieved a specific project and inspected its team list to confirm team member relationships (team_member table).

The results confirm that employee, project, and team_member data can be read through the provided functions, supporting the conclusion that the underlying database structure includes these three tables with read access.

No state-changing operations were performed. All facts were verified through function returns.

{
  "tables": ["employee", "project", "team_member"],
  "read_capability_confirmed": true
}
