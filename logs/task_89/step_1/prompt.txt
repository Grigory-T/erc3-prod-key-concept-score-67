Step 1: Identify the concrete technical implementation (database tables and fields) needed to list projects where two employees are both involved, confirming that the core SQL database with tables employee, project, and team_member is available for read access.
Approach: Use the provided SQL schema to determine that employee.id and employee.name identify employees, project.id and project.name identify projects, and team_member links employees to projects. Confirm that listing projects can be done via read-only SQL SELECT queries on employee, team_member, and project tables. No external wiki search is required because the schema is explicitly provided and unambiguous.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"read_capability_confirmed":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["tables","read_capability_confirmed"]}
