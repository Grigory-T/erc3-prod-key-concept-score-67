STEP 2 - CONCLUSION

Completed: 2025-12-10 00:16:33

I have successfully executed Step 2 by locating the target employees using multiple search methods. For "Sarti Carlotta", no exact match was found, but semantic matching identified "Carlotta Sarti" (employee ID: bAsk_149) as the likely match with reversed name order. For "Nino Valente", an exact match was found (employee ID: bAsk_142), but fuzzy matching also identified "Noemi Valente" (employee ID: bAsk_151) with high confidence, indicating potential ambiguity in the search results. All data was verified through function returns with no assumptions made.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations to search and verify employee data.
