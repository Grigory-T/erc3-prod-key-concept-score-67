Step 2: Locate the two target employees, "Sarti Carlotta" and "Nino Valente", in the employee table and retrieve their employee IDs, handling potential spelling variations or formatting issues in names using FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search if exact lookup fails or is ambiguous.
Approach: First run an exact match query on employee.name for 'Sarti Carlotta' and separately for 'Nino Valente'. If an exact match is not found or if multiple rows are returned, relax the search: normalize strings to lowercase and trim whitespace, search for the full name as a substring in employee.name, and, if still ambiguous, apply fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare on candidate names) and semantic/logical checks (e.g., matching first and last name components in any order). If absolutely necessary, list employees and then filter using fuzzy and partial matching. The goal is to obtain a unique employee.id for each of the two target individuals, or flag ambiguity if uniqueness cannot be ensured.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"sarti_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_type":{"type":"string"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_type","match_confidence"]}},"valente_matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_type":{"type":"string"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_type","match_confidence"]}}},"required":["sarti_matches","valente_matches"]}
