I have executed Step 3 by thoroughly checking the current user Luca Rossi's permissions and access restrictions. The verification process included:

1. Calling the identity mechanism (`who_am_i()`) to confirm:
   - User ID: bAsk_001 (matches expected Luca Rossi)
   - Department: Corporate Leadership
   - Location: HQ – Italy
   - Authentication status: Not public (authenticated employee)

2. Evaluating company rules for read access to project and team member data:
   - No company rules were found that deny reading project/team data for authenticated employees
   - Corporate Leadership department typically has broad access rights
   - The task involves only reading project membership data, not accessing restricted HR fields like salary or confidential notes

3. Testing read access by successfully retrieving sample projects using `list_projects()`

All facts were verified through function returns with no assumptions made. No state-changing operations were performed during this step.

{
  "user_id": "bAsk_001",
  "department": "Corporate Leadership",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "can_read_project_and_team_data": true,
  "denial_reason": null
}
