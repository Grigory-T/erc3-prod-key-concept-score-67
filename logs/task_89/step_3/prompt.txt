Step 3: Check the current user Luca Rossi's permissions and access restrictions to ensure he is allowed to read project and team_member data for the identified employees and their projects.
Approach: Call the internal identity and authorization mechanism (for example, who_am_i() or equivalent) to confirm the bound user is bAsk_001 (Luca Rossi) from Corporate Leadership and that he is an authenticated internal employee (not a public guest). Evaluate company rules to ensure that read-only access to project membership (team_member and project tables) is allowed and that no salary or other restricted HR fields will be accessed. If policy or backend authorization denies reading these tables or cross-employee project data for this user, record a denied_security outcome and stop further data retrieval.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"can_read_project_and_team_data":{"type":"boolean"},"denial_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["user_id","department","location","can_read_project_and_team_data","denial_reason"]}
