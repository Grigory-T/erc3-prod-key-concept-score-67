DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:09:35
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The first step has been completed fully and precisely according to the plan: a comprehensive and multi-method search for the phrase (including semantic, fuzzy, substring, and exact matches) in all relevant internal wiki documentation. While there were no direct hits on a project nickname or the requested phrase, this is an expected and valid possible outcome for Step 1. There is no evidence that the task cannot be completed—there are next steps defined in the plan that proceed to systematically search the authoritative project source (i.e., the project table/database) using similar advanced matching. All necessary functions and sources are available for continued processing, and there are no discrepancies or inconsistencies requiring a replan. The plan remains valid. Continue to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:13:01
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The task is progressing exactly according to the Original Plan: Steps 1 and 2 have both produced results as expected, confirming there is a project registry system/API available to continue. There are no errors, missing functions, or unanticipated issues. The only thing missing so far is a specific nickname found in internal docs (expected), but this does not block continued progress, as searching project records directly is the next step. Therefore, the plan is still valid and we should CONTINUE to Step 3.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:26:07
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The progress so far strictly follows the original plan. Steps 1-3 are complete and have produced expected, relevant results with a clear, sorted candidates list based on similarity. No inconsistencies or missing functions are detected. The next planned step (Step 4) is necessary: verify the user's identity and confirm read access to the candidate project names. This is fully achievable with current data and company policy. There is no evidence of outcome certainty yet (Step 5 will address if clarification is needed). The plan remains valid and actionable. Therefore, the correct choice is to continue to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:32:55
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps have proceeded as expected and all data sources and processes specified in the Original Plan are available and have returned valid, relevant results. No errors, restrictions, or inconsistencies have emerged: Step 1 found no exact nickname in the wiki but clarified approach; Step 2 confirmed the project system and access method; Step 3 produced a ranked list of candidate matching projects; Step 4 validated that the current user can view all candidate project names; Step 5 (next) requires only filtering and selection based on similarity scores. The plan has not encountered any reason to abort or replan—task evaluation aligns perfectly with the original outlined steps. The next action is to continue and complete Step 5 per plan.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 19:38:32
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The original plan is now complete: all steps have been executed as described, each with verified data and no missing or skipped actions. The last step correctly determined that clarification is needed from the user, since multiple candidate projects match the query with similar scores and none stands out as a clear, unambiguous match. There are no remaining steps. Per the plan, the task is complete and the final answer should inform the user that clarification is required, listing the main candidate project names found.
