I have completed Step 1 by performing a comprehensive search for the vague phrase "quel progetto interessante con tutti gli extra" in the company wiki. I executed all required search methods:

1. **Exact phrase matching** - Searched for the complete phrase and components using regex
2. **Normalized substring search** - Converted to lowercase and searched for individual words and phrases
3. **Fuzzy search (Levenshtein distance)** - Used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with 20 related Italian and English terms
4. **Semantic/logical expansion** - Searched for synonyms like "premium", "deluxe", "extended", "complete", "optional", "extra", etc.

The search covered all 19 wiki files and found:
- **45 substring matches** for individual words from the phrase (mostly common words like "con", "all", "gli")
- **8 files with semantic synonyms** (containing words like "full", "complete", "optional", "extra")
- **400 fuzzy matches** across all files with various relevance ratios

However, **no specific project nickname or reference** matching "quel progetto interessante con tutti gli extra" or any equivalent phrase was found. The matches found are general references to project management, business processes, or common words that appear in many contexts.

All searches were performed using the available functions (`search_wiki_fuzzy`, `search_wiki`, `load_wiki`) and no state-changing operations were performed. No assumptions were made - all results are based on actual function returns.
