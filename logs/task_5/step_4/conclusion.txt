STEP 4 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-09 19:32:50

I have completed Step 4 by verifying the current user's identity and permissions for viewing the candidate projects from Step 3. Here are the key findings:

1. **User Identity Confirmed**: The current user is Beatrice Moretti (ID: ayEi_139) from the Finance & Administration department at HQ - Italy. The user is authenticated (not public).

2. **System Roles**: The available API functions do not provide a direct way to retrieve system roles. The `who_am_i()` function returns basic user context, and `get_employee()` returns employee details, but neither includes a `system_roles` field. Therefore, I cannot retrieve the user's specific system roles with the current available functions.

3. **Project Access Analysis**: According to the company rules provided and the step description, reading project metadata (names, descriptions) is not subject to special restrictions. All authenticated employees should be able to view project names. Therefore, I have marked all 35 candidate projects from Step 3 as viewable (`can_view_name: true`).

No state-changing operations were performed. All conclusions are based on actual function returns and company rule analysis.
