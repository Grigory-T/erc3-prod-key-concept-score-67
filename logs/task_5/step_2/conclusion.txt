I have completed Step 2 with thorough verification. After examining the project registry documentation and testing the available API functions:

1. **Documentation Analysis**: The `systems/project_registry.md` file clearly documents the Project Registry as the central system for tracking all customer and internal work projects. The documentation describes core project fields, statuses, and team management but does not explicitly mention a SQL `project` table.

2. **SQL Table Search**: I performed extensive searches for SQL table references using regex patterns for CREATE TABLE, INSERT INTO, JOIN, etc. The search found only false positives (words like 'time', 'the', 'every') - no actual SQL table named `project` was found in any wiki documentation.

3. **API Verification**: I successfully tested the available project API functions:
   - `list_projects()` returned actual projects (e.g., "HV anti-corrosion system for rail bogies")
   - `search_projects()` successfully performed queries
   - Other functions like `get_project()` and `list_all_projects()` are also available

4. **System Confirmation**: The Project Registry system exists and provides complete query capabilities through the API functions. While no SQL table reference was found in the documentation, the API functions serve as the authoritative interface for project data access.

All facts were verified through actual function calls and documentation examination. No state-changing operations were performed.
