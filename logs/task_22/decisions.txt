DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:10:51
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The completed step has confirmed user permissions and did not uncover any unexpected results or issues that would prevent proceeding. The next planned step is to search the internal wiki for documentation about offices and factories mentioning Novi Sad / Нови Сад. This step remains valid based on the original plan and all necessary permissions have been established. No replanning, abort, or early final answer is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:14:39
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The original plan requires both wiki/documentation search and a structured location data query before a final answer is determined. Step 2 (wiki search) has been correctly and fully executed, and the result matches plan expectations: no office in Novi Sad is documented, only a factory. Step 3 (structured data query) is still pending. The plan clearly says to proceed to step 3 before making a final decision. No need to replan or abort.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:20:18
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced relevant and correct results, matching the expectations and requirements set in the Original Plan. The only remaining step is to synthesize the already collected evidence into a final answer. Both the wiki and structured data provide clear negative evidence: there is mention only of a factory near Novi Sad, and no evidence of an office in Novi Sad. Therefore, the final step can be completed directly using the obtained results, as per the Original Plan.
