# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-04
Current actor: Authenticated user iv5n_133
User details: {"id": "iv5n_133", "name": "Stefano Ricci", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INPUT: AGENT ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Verify current user identity and permissions (who_am_i) to confirm that Stefano Ricci from Human Resources (HR) at HQ – Italy is allowed to read internal information about company locations and offices.
Approach: Call the internal identity and authorization service (who_am_i) to retrieve the bound employee record for user id 'iv5n_133', including department, location, and system roles. Confirm that reading high-level company location and office information (such as whether we have an office in a specific city) is permitted for this user. No additional validation beyond this permission check should be performed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_office_locations":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_office_locations"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step to verify the current user identity and permissions. Stefano Ricci (user_id: iv5n_133) is an authenticated employee from the Human Resources (HR) department at HQ – Italy. I confirmed he is allowed to read internal information about company locations and offices because:

1. He is authenticated (is_public=False)
2. No company rules restrict HR employees from reading office location information
3. Office locations are considered internal company information that authenticated employees should be able to access

However, I was unable to retrieve the user's system_roles as the EmployeeFull object does not contain this attribute, and there's no available function to retrieve system_roles directly. The expected output requires system_roles, so I'm returning an empty array for this field.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations were executed.

{
  "user_id": "iv5n_133",
  "name": "Stefano Ricci",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_office_locations": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Search the internal wiki (wiki_file table) for documentation about company offices and factories that mentions Novi Sad / Нови Сад, in order to detect if an office is explicitly listed there.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file.path and wiki_file.content to find any pages describing offices, factories, or locations that contain references to 'Novi Sad' or 'Нови Сад'. The search must account for typos, misspellings, partial matches, transliteration (latin 'Novi Sad' vs cyrillic 'Нови Сад'), and related phrases like 'near Novi Sad'. Prefer exact matches of 'Novi Sad' / 'Нови Сад' if present, then relax filters using substring checks (lowercased and whitespace-normalized), regex, and fuzzy_compare / fuzzy_find_in_text functions. Collect all matching wiki_file entries and identify whether any explicitly state that there is an "office" in Novi Sad, as distinct from, for example, a factory near Novi Sad.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_novi_sad_office_mention":{"type":"boolean"},"wiki_pages":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"path":{"type":"string"},"mention_type":{"type":"string","description":"e.g. 'office', 'factory', 'near-city-reference'"},"confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["path","mention_type","confidence"]}}},"required":["has_novi_sad_office_mention","wiki_pages"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 2 exactly as instructed. I performed a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the internal wiki for mentions of 'Novi Sad' and 'Нови Сад'. The search included:

1. **Listed all wiki pages** (19 total) to understand the scope
2. **Used fuzzy search** (search_wiki_fuzzy) with the terms ['Novi Sad', 'Нови Сад', 'NoviSad', 'Novi_Sad'] - returned 80 matches
3. **Used regex search** (search_wiki) for case-insensitive patterns - returned 1 match
4. **Analyzed matches** by loading wiki content and examining context around matches
5. **Determined mention types** by checking if context contained 'office', 'factory', or other location-related terms
6. **Verified findings** by manually checking the most relevant page and searching for office-specific mentions

The search revealed only one relevant wiki page: "company/locations_and_sites.md". This page contains a reference to Novi Sad in the context of a "Serbian Factory" (production plant), not an office. While the document discusses office spaces at other locations (Italian Factory and European hubs), there is no explicit mention of an office in Novi Sad.

All data in the JSON response is derived directly from function returns and analysis of the wiki content. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki system.

The conclusion is based on verified facts from the wiki search: there is no explicit office mention in Novi Sad in any wiki documentation.

{
  "has_novi_sad_office_mention": false,
  "wiki_pages": [
    {
      "path": "company/locations_and_sites.md",
      "mention_type": "factory",
      "confidence": 0.9
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Query structured location data (location table and any structured office location references) to find any location entries corresponding exactly or approximately to Novi Sad / Нови Сад, and determine if they are marked as an office.
Approach: Run a query against the location table using an exact match filter on name for 'Novi Sad' and 'Нови Сад'. If no exact matches are returned, relax the search by checking if the normalized search strings (lowercased, whitespace-trimmed) are contained in location.name (using a substring 'in' style check), then use regex, and finally a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search (e.g., fuzzy_compare on city names) to capture misspellings or alternative forms. Where available in structured data or related metadata, distinguish between entries that represent an "office" in the city versus other site types (for example, factory near Novi Sad). Collect all matching location names and any associated type indicators such as 'office', 'factory', or similar, taking care to include possible typos or alternate spellings like 'Novi-Sad', 'NoviSad', etc.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"matched_locations":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"location_name":{"type":"string"},"site_type":{"type":"string","description":"e.g. 'office','factory','warehouse','other'"},"match_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["location_name","match_confidence"]}}},"required":["matched_locations"]}
**Result:** I have completed Step 3 by thoroughly querying all available structured location data for entries corresponding to Novi Sad / Нови Сад. After examining 153 employees (8 unique location values), 21 customers (14 unique country locations), and project descriptions, and applying exact matching, substring checks, and fuzzy matching, no location entries in the structured data match or approximately correspond to Novi Sad. The only Serbian-related location is "Serbian Plant" in employee data, which is marked as a factory (not an office) and doesn't mention Novi Sad in the structured location name. All findings are derived directly from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data.

{
  "matched_locations": []
}

### Final Result
No, we do not have an office in Нови Сад. Both the internal wiki and structured location data indicate only the presence of a Serbian factory near Novi Sad, but there is no explicit or implied mention of an office in the city. All evidence supports the conclusion that there is no office in Novi Sad.

COMPANY POLICIES CHECK
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
No mention rules for this user type

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLASSIFICATION CHECKS (in priority order)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

permission_denied_critical → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user is only requesting information about office locations, not attempting a critical action like data deletion.

functionality_not_available → none_unsupported
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: All necessary functionality to determine if there is an office in Нови Сад exists (searching wiki and structured location data).

not_sufficient_rights → denied_security
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user is an authenticated employee in Human Resources with permission to read internal company location information.

more_info_needed → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The task is clear, and all needed information was provided and available in the system.

unclear_task → none_clarification_needed
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The user's request is clear and specific.

system_error → error_internal
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: There is no evidence of any system error. All queries executed as expected.

object_not_found → ok_not_found
  Status: ✓ APPLIES
  Reasoning: The object being searched for (an office in Нови Сад) does not exist in the system in either wiki documentation or structured data, so this outcome applies.

task_completed → ok_answer
  Status: ✗ does not apply
  Reasoning: The agent successfully completed all required search and analysis operations, but since the answer is negative (object not found), 'object_not_found' is the best fit.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
