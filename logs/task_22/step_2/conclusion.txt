I have completed Step 2 exactly as instructed. I performed a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search of the internal wiki for mentions of 'Novi Sad' and 'Нови Сад'. The search included:

1. **Listed all wiki pages** (19 total) to understand the scope
2. **Used fuzzy search** (search_wiki_fuzzy) with the terms ['Novi Sad', 'Нови Сад', 'NoviSad', 'Novi_Sad'] - returned 80 matches
3. **Used regex search** (search_wiki) for case-insensitive patterns - returned 1 match
4. **Analyzed matches** by loading wiki content and examining context around matches
5. **Determined mention types** by checking if context contained 'office', 'factory', or other location-related terms
6. **Verified findings** by manually checking the most relevant page and searching for office-specific mentions

The search revealed only one relevant wiki page: "company/locations_and_sites.md". This page contains a reference to Novi Sad in the context of a "Serbian Factory" (production plant), not an office. While the document discusses office spaces at other locations (Italian Factory and European hubs), there is no explicit mention of an office in Novi Sad.

All data in the JSON response is derived directly from function returns and analysis of the wiki content. No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations on the wiki system.

The conclusion is based on verified facts from the wiki search: there is no explicit office mention in Novi Sad in any wiki documentation.
