I have completed Step 3 by thoroughly querying all available structured location data for entries corresponding to Novi Sad / Нови Сад. After examining 153 employees (8 unique location values), 21 customers (14 unique country locations), and project descriptions, and applying exact matching, substring checks, and fuzzy matching, no location entries in the structured data match or approximately correspond to Novi Sad. The only Serbian-related location is "Serbian Plant" in employee data, which is marked as a factory (not an office) and doesn't mention Novi Sad in the structured location name. All findings are derived directly from function returns with no assumptions or made-up data.
