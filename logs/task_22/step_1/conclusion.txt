I have executed the step to verify the current user identity and permissions. Stefano Ricci (user_id: iv5n_133) is an authenticated employee from the Human Resources (HR) department at HQ – Italy. I confirmed he is allowed to read internal information about company locations and offices because:

1. He is authenticated (is_public=False)
2. No company rules restrict HR employees from reading office location information
3. Office locations are considered internal company information that authenticated employees should be able to access

However, I was unable to retrieve the user's system_roles as the EmployeeFull object does not contain this attribute, and there's no available function to retrieve system_roles directly. The expected output requires system_roles, so I'm returning an empty array for this field.

No state-changing operations were performed - only read operations were executed.

{
  "user_id": "iv5n_133",
  "name": "Stefano Ricci",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": [],
  "can_read_office_locations": true
}
