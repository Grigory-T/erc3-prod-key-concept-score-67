Step 1: Verify current user identity and permissions (who_am_i) to confirm that Stefano Ricci from Human Resources (HR) at HQ – Italy is allowed to read internal information about company locations and offices.
Approach: Call the internal identity and authorization service (who_am_i) to retrieve the bound employee record for user id 'iv5n_133', including department, location, and system roles. Confirm that reading high-level company location and office information (such as whether we have an office in a specific city) is permitted for this user. No additional validation beyond this permission check should be performed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_read_office_locations":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["user_id","department","location","system_roles","can_read_office_locations"]}
