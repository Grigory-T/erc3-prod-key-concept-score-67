Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee context (who_am_i) for user BwFV_139, including department, location, and system roles, without logging any information.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity/employee registry function (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) to retrieve the currently authenticated employee profile for user BwFV_139. Use exact identifier matching on the employee.id field. Do not perform any write operations. The result will be used later for permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
