Completed Step 1: Retrieved current authenticated employee context for user BwFV_139. The who_am_i() function provided the user's department and location. The get_employee() function provided the full name. System roles information is not available through the provided API functions, so an empty array is returned as specified in the step instructions. No write operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.
