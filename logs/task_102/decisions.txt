DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:29:47
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 has been completed exactly as described in the original plan. The user's identity, department, and location have been accurately retrieved. The absence of system_roles is consistent with the API's current output and the explicit step instructions (which handle the empty array scenario). There have been no discrepancies, unexpected results, or deviations from the original plan. The next step is to identify the customer record, as per Step 2. Since the planned process remains valid and all needed data was obtained, it is appropriate to proceed to the next step.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:31:40
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 2) produced the expected and correct results, successfully identifying the customer with a high-confidence match. There are no inconsistencies or issues requiring a replan. The next step in the original plan is Step 3, to identify the corresponding project for the identified customer. The plan remains valid, progress is being made according to the documented approach, and the task is still possible to complete in full by following the remaining steps.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:34:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Steps 1, 2, and 3 all completed successfully and their outcomes match the expected results from the original plan. Each produced the correct information needed for the subsequent steps, with no deviations or unexpected results. No information from these steps suggests that the remaining steps cannot be performed as originally planned. There is no indication of missing permissions, missing data, or process errors. Therefore, the task should continue following the original plan by proceeding to Step 4.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:37:57
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have completed successfully and precise expected outputs have been produced at each stage. There are no discrepancies or unexpected results. The plan remains valid per the original instructions. Next, per the plan, I should proceed to Step 5 and retrieve all relevant time_entry records. No replanning is needed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:41:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All previous steps have proceeded according to the original plan with no errors or roadblocks, and the data returned is as expected (three valid time entries for the correct project, customer, and date range). There are no inconsistencies or missing information. The only remaining step is to aggregate the hours per plan and produce a simple numeric summary. Therefore, the plan is still valid and I should CONTINUE to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-10 00:43:37
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
All planned steps have been completed successfully and in accordance with both the original plan and company policy. All required data has been collected and no discrepancies or policy violations have occurred. The final totals of hours (billable and non-billable) for the project and customer within the requested date range are confirmed and reproducible. No further steps are necessary as the original goal has been achieved.
