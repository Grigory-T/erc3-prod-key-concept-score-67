Step 3 completed successfully. I identified the project record for "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". 

The verification process:
1. Used the customer_id "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" from Step 2
2. Queried the project table for records where project.customer_id equals this customer_id
3. Found 1 project for this customer: "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
4. Performed exact match comparison: project.name == "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" → EXACT MATCH FOUND
5. No need for case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, semantic, or logical search since exact match was found
6. All data was explicitly verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data
7. No state-changing operations were performed

The project was confirmed to belong to the correct customer and have the exact name requested.
