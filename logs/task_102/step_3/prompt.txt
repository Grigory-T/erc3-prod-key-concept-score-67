Step 3: Identify the project record corresponding to the name "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the previously identified customer, using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search and accounting for possible typos or partial matches in the project name.
Approach: Using the customer_id candidates from Step 2 (preferring the highest-confidence match), query the project table for records where project.customer_id equals the selected customer_id. First attempt an exact match on project.name = 'Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses'. If not found, perform case-insensitive and substring search where the normalized search string is contained in project.name. If still ambiguous or not found, apply fuzzy matching and semantic/logical search over project.name and description to handle spelling differences and similar phrasing. If multiple candidate projects are found, keep all with their confidence scores for potential manual disambiguation; do not auto-resolve beyond indicating top matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id_used":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["project_id","project_name","customer_id","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","customer_id_used","matches"]}
