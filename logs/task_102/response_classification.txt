# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-20
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_139
User details: {"id": "BwFV_139", "name": "Ignazio Bianco", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee context (who_am_i) for user BwFV_139, including department, location, and system roles, without logging any information.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity/employee registry function (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) to retrieve the currently authenticated employee profile for user BwFV_139. Use exact identifier matching on the employee.id field. Do not perform any write operations. The result will be used later for permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** Completed Step 1: Retrieved current authenticated employee context for user BwFV_139. The who_am_i() function provided the user's department and location. The get_employee() function provided the full name. System roles information is not available through the provided API functions, so an empty array is returned as specified in the step instructions. No write operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "name": "Ignazio Bianco",
  "department": "Finance & Administration",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the customer record corresponding to the name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" in the customer table, handling potential misspellings or naming variations using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search.
Approach: Search the customer table for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: perform case-insensitive comparison, then check if the normalized search string is contained in customer.name (using lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or multiple candidates exist, apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical search on the customer.name and brief fields to handle typos, pluralization, and minor wording differences. If multiple candidates are found, sort them by confidence score. Do not modify any data; only read.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully identified the customer record for "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" through exact matching. The customer was found with ID "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" and name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". No fuzzy or semantic matching was required as an exact match was found. All data was verified from function returns.

{
  "query_name": "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions",
  "matches": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "customer_name": "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the project record corresponding to the name "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the previously identified customer, using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search and accounting for possible typos or partial matches in the project name.
Approach: Using the customer_id candidates from Step 2 (preferring the highest-confidence match), query the project table for records where project.customer_id equals the selected customer_id. First attempt an exact match on project.name = 'Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses'. If not found, perform case-insensitive and substring search where the normalized search string is contained in project.name. If still ambiguous or not found, apply fuzzy matching and semantic/logical search over project.name and description to handle spelling differences and similar phrasing. If multiple candidate projects are found, keep all with their confidence scores for potential manual disambiguation; do not auto-resolve beyond indicating top matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id_used":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["project_id","project_name","customer_id","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","customer_id_used","matches"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I identified the project record for "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". 

The verification process:
1. Used the customer_id "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" from Step 2
2. Queried the project table for records where project.customer_id equals this customer_id
3. Found 1 project for this customer: "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
4. Performed exact match comparison: project.name == "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" → EXACT MATCH FOUND
5. No need for case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, semantic, or logical search since exact match was found
6. All data was explicitly verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data
7. No state-changing operations were performed

The project was confirmed to belong to the correct customer and have the exact name requested.

{
  "query_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
  "customer_id_used": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "matches": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "project_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the current user (from Step 1) has permission to read time_entry data for the identified project and customer over the requested date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31.
Approach: Once a specific project_id and customer_id have been selected from Steps 2 and 3 (for example, the highest-confidence unique matches), evaluate the authorization rules for user BwFV_139 based on their system_roles and department. Use the backend permission-check mechanism for read access to time_entry records for that project and customer, over any dates. Do not assume additional policies beyond the existing time tracking and reporting rules; simply invoke the appropriate permission check and capture whether access is allowed or denied and why.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_time_entries":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","project_id","customer_id","can_read_time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed. I executed the step by checking the user's permission to read time_entry data through a test query using the search_time_entries function. The test query succeeded without permission errors, confirming the user has read access. No state-changing operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

The user is authenticated (not public), belongs to the Finance & Administration department, and was able to successfully access time entries for the specified project and customer within the requested date range.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "can_read_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User successfully accessed time entries for the specified project and customer without permission errors, indicating read access is allowed"
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve all time_entry records between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31 (inclusive) that are linked to the identified project and customer, without adding extra filters beyond those explicitly requested.
Approach: Provided that Step 4 indicates can_read_time_entries = true, query the time_entry table for rows where project_id equals the selected project_id, customer_id equals the selected customer_id, and entry_date is between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive. Do not impose any additional conditions on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided as stored) or on work_category beyond what exists in the data model. Ensure that results include at least id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, and customer_id. Do not modify any records; this is a read-only reporting query.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"time_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"entry_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"hours":{"type":"number"},"billable":{"type":"boolean"},"status":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","employee_id","entry_date","hours","billable","status","project_id","customer_id"]}}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","time_entries"]}
**Result:** Upon verification, I confirm that Step 5 was executed correctly:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the time_entry table for rows where:
   - project_id = "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
   - customer_id = "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
   - entry_date between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project and customer IDs from previous steps
   - Applied no additional filters (included all statuses as stored)
   - Retrieved all required fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, customer_id
   - Performed read-only operations only (no modifications)

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The `search_time_entries` function returned 3 entries
   - Each entry's fields were explicitly printed in the code execution:
     - te_100: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-05, hours 3.0, billable True, status submitted
     - te_101: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-10, hours 2.5, billable False, status submitted
     - te_102: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-15, hours 4.0, billable True, status submitted
   - All status fields are now explicitly verified and corrected from "draft" to "submitted"
   - No state-changing operations were performed

I corrected the status field values based on the explicit verification output. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",
  "date_end": "2025-03-31",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_100",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-05",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_101",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-10",
      "hours": 2.5,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_102",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-15",
      "hours": 4.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 5, iterate through each entry and sum hours into three running totals: (1) total_hours (sum of hours for all entries), (2) total_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is true), and (3) total_non_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is false). Ensure that hours values are treated as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision. The final result should clearly report the project_id, customer_id, date range, and the three totals.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_billable_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_non_billable_hours":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","total_hours","total_billable_hours","total_non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I confirm Step 6 was executed correctly according to the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I aggregated the time_entry records from Step 5 to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact same project_id, customer_id, and date range from previous steps
   - Iterated through each time entry and summed hours into three running totals
   - Treated hours values as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision
   - Reported the project_id, customer_id, date range, and three totals as required

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The time entries were retrieved directly from the system via `search_time_entries()` function
   - All 3 entries were explicitly printed and verified: te_100 (3.0 hours, billable), te_101 (2.5 hours, non-billable), te_102 (4.0 hours, billable)
   - The aggregation calculations were verified: 3.0 + 2.5 + 4.0 = 9.5 total hours
   - Billable hours: 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0
   - Non-billable hours: 2.5
   - Verification showed total = billable + non-billable (9.5 = 7.0 + 2.5)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All values in the JSON response come directly from function returns and explicit calculations based on those returns.

5. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The step was completed successfully with all requirements met.

  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",

  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "name": "Ignazio Bianco",
  "department": "Finance & Administration",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the customer record corresponding to the name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" in the customer table, handling potential misspellings or naming variations using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search.
Approach: Search the customer table for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: perform case-insensitive comparison, then check if the normalized search string is contained in customer.name (using lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or multiple candidates exist, apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical search on the customer.name and brief fields to handle typos, pluralization, and minor wording differences. If multiple candidates are found, sort them by confidence score. Do not modify any data; only read.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully identified the customer record for "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" through exact matching. The customer was found with ID "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" and name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". No fuzzy or semantic matching was required as an exact match was found.

      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "customer_name": "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the project record corresponding to the name "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the previously identified customer, using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search and accounting for possible typos or partial matches in the project name.
Approach: Using the customer_id candidates from Step 2 (preferring the highest-confidence match), query the project table for records where project.customer_id equals the selected customer_id. First attempt an exact match on project.name = 'Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses'. If not found, perform case-insensitive and substring search where the normalized search string is contained in project.name. If still ambiguous or not found, apply fuzzy matching and semantic/logical search over project.name and description to handle spelling differences and similar phrasing. If multiple candidate projects are found, keep all with their confidence scores for potential manual disambiguation; do not auto-resolve beyond indicating top matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id_used":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["project_id","project_name","customer_id","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","customer_id_used","matches"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I identified the project record for "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". 

The verification process:

  "query_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
  "customer_id_used": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "matches": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "project_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the current user (from Step 1) has permission to read time_entry data for the identified project and customer over the requested date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31.
Approach: Once a specific project_id and customer_id have been selected from Steps 2 and 3 (for example, the highest-confidence unique matches), evaluate the authorization rules for user BwFV_139 based on their system_roles and department. Use the backend permission-check mechanism for read access to time_entry records for that project and customer, over any dates. Do not assume additional policies beyond the existing time tracking and reporting rules; simply invoke the appropriate permission check and capture whether access is allowed or denied and why.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_time_entries":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","project_id","customer_id","can_read_time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed. I executed the step by checking the user's permission to read time_entry data through a test query using the search_time_entries function. The test query succeeded without permission errors, confirming the user has read access. No state-changing operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

The user is authenticated (not public), belongs to the Finance & Administration department, and was able to successfully access time entries for the specified project and customer within the requested date range.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "can_read_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User successfully accessed time entries for the specified project and customer without permission errors, indicating read access is allowed"
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve all time_entry records between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31 (inclusive) that are linked to the identified project and customer, without adding extra filters beyond those explicitly requested.
Approach: Provided that Step 4 indicates can_read_time_entries = true, query the time_entry table for rows where project_id equals the selected project_id, customer_id equals the selected customer_id, and entry_date is between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive. Do not impose any additional conditions on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided as stored) or on work_category beyond what exists in the data model. Ensure that results include at least id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, and customer_id. Do not modify any records; this is a read-only reporting query.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"time_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"entry_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"hours":{"type":"number"},"billable":{"type":"boolean"},"status":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","employee_id","entry_date","hours","billable","status","project_id","customer_id"]}}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","time_entries"]}
**Result:** Upon verification, I confirm that Step 5 was executed correctly:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the time_entry table for rows where:
   - project_id = "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
   - customer_id = "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
   - entry_date between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project and customer IDs from previous steps
   - Applied no additional filters (included all statuses as stored)
   - Retrieved all required fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, customer_id
   - Performed read-only operations only (no modifications)

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The `search_time_entries` function returned 3 entries
   - Each entry's fields were explicitly printed in the code execution:
     - te_100: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-05, hours 3.0, billable True, status submitted
     - te_101: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-10, hours 2.5, billable False, status submitted
     - te_102: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-15, hours 4.0, billable True, status submitted
   - All status fields are now explicitly verified and corrected from "draft" to "submitted"
   - No state-changing operations were performed

I corrected the status field values based on the explicit verification output. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns.

{
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",
  "date_end": "2025-03-31",
  "time_entries": [
    {
      "id": "te_100",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-05",
      "hours": 3.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_101",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-10",
      "hours": 2.5,
      "billable": false,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    },
    {
      "id": "te_102",
      "employee_id": "BwFV_040",
      "entry_date": "2025-03-15",
      "hours": 4.0,
      "billable": true,
      "status": "submitted",
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 6
Step 6: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 5, iterate through each entry and sum hours into three running totals: (1) total_hours (sum of hours for all entries), (2) total_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is true), and (3) total_non_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is false). Ensure that hours values are treated as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision. The final result should clearly report the project_id, customer_id, date range, and the three totals.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_billable_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_non_billable_hours":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","total_hours","total_billable_hours","total_non_billable_hours"]}
**Result:** I confirm Step 6 was executed correctly according to the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I aggregated the time_entry records from Step 5 to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact same project_id, customer_id, and date range from previous steps
   - Iterated through each time entry and summed hours into three running totals
   - Treated hours values as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision
   - Reported the project_id, customer_id, date range, and three totals as required

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The time entries were retrieved directly from the system via `search_time_entries()` function
   - All 3 entries were explicitly printed and verified: te_100 (3.0 hours, billable), te_101 (2.5 hours, non-billable), te_102 (4.0 hours, billable)
   - The aggregation calculations were verified: 3.0 + 2.5 + 4.0 = 9.5 total hours
   - Billable hours: 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0
   - Non-billable hours: 2.5
   - Verification showed total = billable + non-billable (9.5 = 7.0 + 2.5)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All values in the JSON response come directly from function returns and explicit calculations based on those returns.

5. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The step was completed successfully with all requirements met.

{
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "date_start": "2025-03-01",
  "date_end": "2025-03-31",
  "total_hours": 9.5,
  "total_billable_hours": 7.0,
  "total_non_billable_hours": 2.5
}

### Final Result
Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, a total of 9.5 hours were logged on the project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" for customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". Out of these, 7.0 hours were billable and 2.5 hours were non-billable. All values have been verified against system data and calculations are complete.

## Classification Rules - Evaluate EACH outcome independently:

ALL DECISIONS SHOULD BE MADE BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
WE DO NOT CONSIDER FUTURE CLARIFICATIONS OR CHANGES OF USER INFORMATION.
THAT IS WHY CHOOSE THE MOST APPROPRIATE OUTCOME BASED ON THE CURRENT USER INFORMATION.
DO NOT TAKE INOT ACCOUNT ESCALATE OR APPROVE FUNCTIONALITY, WE SHOULD BASED OUT DESCISION ON **CURRENT EXISTING INFORMATION ONLY**.

### permission_denied_critical
- data/erasing deletion requests - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT EXCEPTIONS

### functionality_not_available (here we mean **requested by the user functionality**)
- we understand the request (terms and actions needed). we understand functionality/api/function needed for the task completion
- BUT this functionality is NOT IMPLEMENTED in the system technically
- functionality cannot be performed technically (DOES NOT DEPEN ON PERMISSIONS OR ACCESS RESTRICTIONS)
- system does not have such api/function at all (technical absence)

### not_sufficient_rights
- functionality exists and available technically, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- BUT user does not have sufficient rights or permissions to execute requested operation

### more_info_needed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- BUT user did not provide enough information to complete the task (required arguments, required fields, etc.)

### unclear_task
- task is vague and unclear or requires subjective judgment
- we DO NOT understand the task and the requested operation

### system_error
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- BUT when performing the action, the system returned an error/timeout/exception (technical issue)

### object_not_found
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- BUT when searching for the concrete object, the system returned no results. Requested objects does not exist in the system

### task_completed
- functionality exists, we fully understand the task and the requested operation
- user have sufficient rights and permissions to execute it
- user provided enough information to complete the task or information is already available in the system
- all functions and api is working correctly, system is stable and working as expected
- all related objects needed for the task are present in the system and were found successfully

## MESSAGE FIELD (CRITICAL!)
The "message" field must contain the ACTUAL ANSWER extracted from the agent's work:
- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
