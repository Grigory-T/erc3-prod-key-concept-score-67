Step 2: Identify the customer record corresponding to the name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" in the customer table, handling potential misspellings or naming variations using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search.
Approach: Search the customer table for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: perform case-insensitive comparison, then check if the normalized search string is contained in customer.name (using lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or multiple candidates exist, apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical search on the customer.name and brief fields to handle typos, pluralization, and minor wording differences. If multiple candidates are found, sort them by confidence score. Do not modify any data; only read.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","matches"]}
