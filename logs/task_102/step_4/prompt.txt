Step 4: Check whether the current user (from Step 1) has permission to read time_entry data for the identified project and customer over the requested date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31.
Approach: Once a specific project_id and customer_id have been selected from Steps 2 and 3 (for example, the highest-confidence unique matches), evaluate the authorization rules for user BwFV_139 based on their system_roles and department. Use the backend permission-check mechanism for read access to time_entry records for that project and customer, over any dates. Do not assume additional policies beyond the existing time tracking and reporting rules; simply invoke the appropriate permission check and capture whether access is allowed or denied and why.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_time_entries":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","project_id","customer_id","can_read_time_entries"]}
