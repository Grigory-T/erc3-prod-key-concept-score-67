Step 4 completed. I executed the step by checking the user's permission to read time_entry data through a test query using the search_time_entries function. The test query succeeded without permission errors, confirming the user has read access. No state-changing operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

The user is authenticated (not public), belongs to the Finance & Administration department, and was able to successfully access time entries for the specified project and customer within the requested date range.

  "can_read_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User successfully accessed time entries for the specified project and customer without permission errors, indicating read access is allowed"
}
