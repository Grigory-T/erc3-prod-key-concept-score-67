I confirm Step 6 was executed correctly according to the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I aggregated the time_entry records from Step 5 to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact same project_id, customer_id, and date range from previous steps
   - Iterated through each time entry and summed hours into three running totals
   - Treated hours values as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision
   - Reported the project_id, customer_id, date range, and three totals as required

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The time entries were retrieved directly from the system via `search_time_entries()` function
   - All 3 entries were explicitly printed and verified: te_100 (3.0 hours, billable), te_101 (2.5 hours, non-billable), te_102 (4.0 hours, billable)
   - The aggregation calculations were verified: 3.0 + 2.5 + 4.0 = 9.5 total hours
   - Billable hours: 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0
   - Non-billable hours: 2.5
   - Verification showed total = billable + non-billable (9.5 = 7.0 + 2.5)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All values in the JSON response come directly from function returns and explicit calculations based on those returns.

5. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The step was completed successfully with all requirements met.
