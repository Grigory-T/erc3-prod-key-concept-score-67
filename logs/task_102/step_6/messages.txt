## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-09-20
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_139
User details: {"id": "BwFV_139", "name": "Ignazio Bianco", "department": "Finance & Administration", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: BwFV_139
department: Finance & Administration
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-09-20
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31, how many hours in total did we log on project Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses for customer Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions, and how many of those hours were billable vs non-billable?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the current authenticated employee context (who_am_i) for user BwFV_139, including department, location, and system roles, without logging any information.
Approach: Call the appropriate identity/employee registry function (for example, who_am_i or equivalent) to retrieve the currently authenticated employee profile for user BwFV_139. Use exact identifier matching on the employee.id field. Do not perform any write operations. The result will be used later for permission checks.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"department":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"system_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["employee_id","department","location","system_roles"]}
**Result:** Completed Step 1: Retrieved current authenticated employee context for user BwFV_139. The who_am_i() function provided the user's department and location. The get_employee() function provided the full name. System roles information is not available through the provided API functions, so an empty array is returned as specified in the step instructions. No write operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "name": "Ignazio Bianco",
  "department": "Finance & Administration",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the customer record corresponding to the name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" in the customer table, handling potential misspellings or naming variations using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search.
Approach: Search the customer table for the target customer. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions'. If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: perform case-insensitive comparison, then check if the normalized search string is contained in customer.name (using lowercase and trimming whitespace). If still not found or multiple candidates exist, apply fuzzy matching (for example, fuzzy_compare or fuzzy_find_in_text) and semantic/logical search on the customer.name and brief fields to handle typos, pluralization, and minor wording differences. If multiple candidates are found, sort them by confidence score. Do not modify any data; only read.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_name":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["customer_id","customer_name","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","matches"]}
**Result:** Successfully identified the customer record for "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" through exact matching. The customer was found with ID "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" and name "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". No fuzzy or semantic matching was required as an exact match was found. All data was verified from function returns.

{
  "query_name": "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions",
  "matches": [
    {
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "customer_name": "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Identify the project record corresponding to the name "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the previously identified customer, using fuzzy, semantic, and logical search and accounting for possible typos or partial matches in the project name.
Approach: Using the customer_id candidates from Step 2 (preferring the highest-confidence match), query the project table for records where project.customer_id equals the selected customer_id. First attempt an exact match on project.name = 'Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses'. If not found, perform case-insensitive and substring search where the normalized search string is contained in project.name. If still ambiguous or not found, apply fuzzy matching and semantic/logical search over project.name and description to handle spelling differences and similar phrasing. If multiple candidate projects are found, keep all with their confidence scores for potential manual disambiguation; do not auto-resolve beyond indicating top matches.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"query_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id_used":{"type":"string"},"matches":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"project_name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"confidence":{"type":"number","minimum":0,"maximum":1}},"required":["project_id","project_name","customer_id","confidence"]}}},"required":["query_name","customer_id_used","matches"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. I identified the project record for "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" that belongs to the customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions". 

The verification process:
1. Used the customer_id "cust_benelux_floor_solutions" from Step 2
2. Queried the project table for records where project.customer_id equals this customer_id
3. Found 1 project for this customer: "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
4. Performed exact match comparison: project.name == "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" → EXACT MATCH FOUND
5. No need for case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, semantic, or logical search since exact match was found
6. All data was explicitly verified from function returns - no assumptions or made-up data
7. No state-changing operations were performed

The project was confirmed to belong to the correct customer and have the exact name requested.

{
  "query_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
  "customer_id_used": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "matches": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
      "project_name": "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses",
      "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
      "confidence": 1.0
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Check whether the current user (from Step 1) has permission to read time_entry data for the identified project and customer over the requested date range 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31.
Approach: Once a specific project_id and customer_id have been selected from Steps 2 and 3 (for example, the highest-confidence unique matches), evaluate the authorization rules for user BwFV_139 based on their system_roles and department. Use the backend permission-check mechanism for read access to time_entry records for that project and customer, over any dates. Do not assume additional policies beyond the existing time tracking and reporting rules; simply invoke the appropriate permission check and capture whether access is allowed or denied and why.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"can_read_time_entries":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["employee_id","project_id","customer_id","can_read_time_entries"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed. I executed the step by checking the user's permission to read time_entry data through a test query using the search_time_entries function. The test query succeeded without permission errors, confirming the user has read access. No state-changing operations were performed, and all data was explicitly verified from function returns.

The user is authenticated (not public), belongs to the Finance & Administration department, and was able to successfully access time entries for the specified project and customer within the requested date range.

{
  "employee_id": "BwFV_139",
  "project_id": "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor",
  "customer_id": "cust_benelux_floor_solutions",
  "can_read_time_entries": true,
  "reason": "User successfully accessed time entries for the specified project and customer without permission errors, indicating read access is allowed"
}

### Step 5
Step 5: Retrieve all time_entry records between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31 (inclusive) that are linked to the identified project and customer, without adding extra filters beyond those explicitly requested.
Approach: Provided that Step 4 indicates can_read_time_entries = true, query the time_entry table for rows where project_id equals the selected project_id, customer_id equals the selected customer_id, and entry_date is between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive. Do not impose any additional conditions on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided as stored) or on work_category beyond what exists in the data model. Ensure that results include at least id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, and customer_id. Do not modify any records; this is a read-only reporting query.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"time_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"entry_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"hours":{"type":"number"},"billable":{"type":"boolean"},"status":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","employee_id","entry_date","hours","billable","status","project_id","customer_id"]}}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","time_entries"]}
**Result:** Upon verification, I confirm that Step 5 was executed correctly:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the time_entry table for rows where:
   - project_id = "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
   - customer_id = "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
   - entry_date between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project and customer IDs from previous steps
   - Applied no additional filters (included all statuses as stored)
   - Retrieved all required fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, customer_id
   - Performed read-only operations only (no modifications)

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The `search_time_entries` function returned 3 entries
   - Each entry's fields were explicitly printed in the code execution:
     - te_100: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-05, hours 3.0, billable True, status submitted
     - te_101: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-10, hours 2.5, billable False, status submitted
     - te_102: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-15, hours 4.0, billable True, status submitted
   - All status fields are now explicitly verified and corrected from "draft" to "submitted"
   - No state-changing operations were performed

I corrected the status field values based on the explicit verification output. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns.

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 6: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 5, iterate through each entry and sum hours into three running totals: (1) total_hours (sum of hours for all entries), (2) total_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is true), and (3) total_non_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is false). Ensure that hours values are treated as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision. The final result should clearly report the project_id, customer_id, date range, and the three totals.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_billable_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_non_billable_hours":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","total_hours","total_billable_hours","total_non_billable_hours"]}

I need to adjust the code to respect the pagination limit of 5 items per page. Let me fix this and then aggregate the time entries.

# Query time entries with proper pagination (max limit = 5)
print(f"\nQuerying time entries for:")
print(f"  Project ID: {project_id}")
print(f"  Customer ID: {customer_id}")
print(f"  Date range: {date_start} to {date_end}")

# Get all time entries using pagination
all_entries = []
offset = 0
limit = 5  # Maximum allowed by the system

while True:
    entries, next_offset, totals = search_time_entries(

Step 6 completed successfully. I aggregated the time_entry records from Step 5 to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range. The aggregation was performed by iterating through each time entry and summing hours into three running totals: total_hours, total_billable_hours, and total_non_billable_hours. All calculations were verified to ensure accuracy.

The results show that for the project "Fast-cure floor system for cold warehouses" (proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor) for customer "Benelux Industrial Floor Solutions" (cust_benelux_floor_solutions) during the period from 2025-03-01 to 2025-03-31, there were 3 time entries totaling 9.5 hours, with 7.0 billable hours and 2.5 non-billable hours.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step - it was a read-only aggregation of existing data.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 6: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 5, iterate through each entry and sum hours into three running totals: (1) total_hours (sum of hours for all entries), (2) total_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is true), and (3) total_non_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is false). Ensure that hours values are treated as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision. The final result should clearly report the project_id, customer_id, date range, and the three totals.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_billable_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_non_billable_hours":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","total_hours","total_billable_hours","total_non_billable_hours"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I confirm Step 6 was executed correctly according to the checklist:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I aggregated the time_entry records from Step 5 to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact same project_id, customer_id, and date range from previous steps
   - Iterated through each time entry and summed hours into three running totals
   - Treated hours values as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision
   - Reported the project_id, customer_id, date range, and three totals as required

3. **All facts verified (not assumed)**:
   - The time entries were retrieved directly from the system via `search_time_entries()` function
   - All 3 entries were explicitly printed and verified: te_100 (3.0 hours, billable), te_101 (2.5 hours, non-billable), te_102 (4.0 hours, billable)
   - The aggregation calculations were verified: 3.0 + 2.5 + 4.0 = 9.5 total hours
   - Billable hours: 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0
   - Non-billable hours: 2.5
   - Verification showed total = billable + non-billable (9.5 = 7.0 + 2.5)

4. **No made-up data or sensible defaults**: All values in the JSON response come directly from function returns and explicit calculations based on those returns.

5. **No state-changing operations**: Only read operations were performed; no update functions were called.

The step was completed successfully with all requirements met.
