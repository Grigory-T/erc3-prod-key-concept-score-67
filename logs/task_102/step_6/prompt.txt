Step 6: Aggregate the retrieved time_entry records to calculate total hours logged and split them into billable versus non-billable for the specified project, customer, and date range.
Approach: Using the list of time_entries from Step 5, iterate through each entry and sum hours into three running totals: (1) total_hours (sum of hours for all entries), (2) total_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is true), and (3) total_non_billable_hours (sum of hours where billable is false). Ensure that hours values are treated as numeric (DECIMAL) and summed with appropriate precision. The final result should clearly report the project_id, customer_id, date range, and the three totals.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"total_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_billable_hours":{"type":"number"},"total_non_billable_hours":{"type":"number"}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","total_hours","total_billable_hours","total_non_billable_hours"]}
