STEP 5 - CONCLUSION
================================================================================
Completed: 2025-12-10 00:41:06

Upon verification, I confirm that Step 5 was executed correctly:

1. **Executed the step instruction**: I queried the time_entry table for rows where:
   - project_id = "proj_benelux_fast_cure_floor"
   - customer_id = "cust_benelux_floor_solutions"
   - entry_date between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive

2. **No actions skipped or assumed**: 
   - Used the exact project and customer IDs from previous steps
   - Applied no additional filters (included all statuses as stored)
   - Retrieved all required fields: id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, customer_id
   - Performed read-only operations only (no modifications)

3. **All facts verified from function returns**:
   - The `search_time_entries` function returned 3 entries
   - Each entry's fields were explicitly printed in the code execution:
     - te_100: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-05, hours 3.0, billable True, status submitted
     - te_101: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-10, hours 2.5, billable False, status submitted
     - te_102: employee BwFV_040, date 2025-03-15, hours 4.0, billable True, status submitted
   - All status fields are now explicitly verified and corrected from "draft" to "submitted"
   - No state-changing operations were performed

I corrected the status field values based on the explicit verification output. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns.
