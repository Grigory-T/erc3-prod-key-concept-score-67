Step 5: Retrieve all time_entry records between 2025-03-01 and 2025-03-31 (inclusive) that are linked to the identified project and customer, without adding extra filters beyond those explicitly requested.
Approach: Provided that Step 4 indicates can_read_time_entries = true, query the time_entry table for rows where project_id equals the selected project_id, customer_id equals the selected customer_id, and entry_date is between '2025-03-01' and '2025-03-31' inclusive. Do not impose any additional conditions on status (include draft, submitted, approved, invoiced, and voided as stored) or on work_category beyond what exists in the data model. Ensure that results include at least id, employee_id, entry_date, hours, billable, status, project_id, and customer_id. Do not modify any records; this is a read-only reporting query.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"},"date_start":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"date_end":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"time_entries":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"entry_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"},"hours":{"type":"number"},"billable":{"type":"boolean"},"status":{"type":"string"},"project_id":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","employee_id","entry_date","hours","billable","status","project_id","customer_id"]}}},"required":["project_id","customer_id","date_start","date_end","time_entries"]}
