DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:41:39
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The last completed step (Step 1) produced the expected and correct result, precisely following the plan: the target date for the time entry was successfully determined as 2025-05-17. No issues or discrepancies were encountered. The remaining steps are still fully relevant and appropriate. There is no reason to replan or abort; the process can continue as originally outlined.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:44:28
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Both Step 1 and Step 2 have produced results strictly as expected per the original plan—Step 1 successfully determined the correct date (2025-05-17), and Step 2 resolved 'Fabbri Claudio' to a unique employee with a high confidence match and no ambiguity. No discrepancies, errors, or missing data have been encountered, and all company policies and rules have been followed. Therefore, there is no need to replan or abort; the original plan remains valid and the next step should be executed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:46:53
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced results exactly as expected according to the original plan. Step 3 successfully identified exactly one matching project, which enables an unambiguous permission check in Step 4. There are no errors, inconsistencies, or missing information. The next action is to proceed and determine whether the current user has the required permission to log time for the filtered project (Step 4). No replanning is necessary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:49:48
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
Step 4 returned outcome = 'denied_security' because the current user does not have Lead permission on the project. According to the Original Plan, Step 5 may only proceed if the outcome from Step 4 is 'ok_answer'. Since the permission check failed and based on the documented company policies and step instructions, the task cannot be completed as intended. All previous steps succeeded, but authorization cannot be granted for time entry by the requesting user. There is no alternative flow or ambiguous result requiring replanning—this is a hard stop according to plan and policy.
