The target date has been calculated and verified. Using today's date from the user context (2025-05-20), I computed yesterday as 2025-05-19 and then subtracted two days to get the final date of 2025-05-17. All calculations were performed using Python's datetime library, and the result was printed and confirmed.

{"target_date": "2025-05-17"}
