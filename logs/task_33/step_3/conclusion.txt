Successfully completed step 3: Identified all projects where employee QR23_036 is a team member and filtered them by the project reference "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform". 

The employee is a team member in 2 projects. After filtering, exactly 1 project matches the reference string with an exact match. This project is "proj_rnd_low_voc_platform_bellini" with name "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform" and customer ID "cust_bellini_internal".

All data was retrieved from function returns: `search_projects` returned the list of projects where the employee is a team member, and exact matching was performed on project names. No state-changing operations were performed; only read-only queries were used.
