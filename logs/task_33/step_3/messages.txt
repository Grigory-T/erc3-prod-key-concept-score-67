## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-20
Current actor: Authenticated user QR23_154
User details: {"id": "QR23_154", "name": "Veronica Romano", "department": "External", "location": "HQ - Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: QR23_154
department: External
location: HQ - Italy
today date: 2025-05-20
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Log 2 hours two days before yesterday for Fabbri Claudio on R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform. Billable, all other values - default. Draft status. Put a note to fill it properly later

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Determine the exact calendar date corresponding to "two days before yesterday" relative to today (2025-05-20), which will be used as the time entry date.
Approach: Use the current date from context (today = 2025-05-20). Compute yesterday as 2025-05-19, then subtract two days to get the target entry date (2025-05-17). Represent the result in ISO date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for use in the time_entry.entry_date field.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"target_date":{"type":"string","format":"date"}},"required":["target_date"]}
**Result:** The target date has been calculated and verified. Using today's date from the user context (2025-05-20), I computed yesterday as 2025-05-19 and then subtracted two days to get the final date of 2025-05-17. All calculations were performed using Python's datetime library, and the result was printed and confirmed.

{"target_date": "2025-05-17"}

### Step 2
Step 2: Resolve the employee referred to as "Fabbri Claudio" to a unique employee.id in the employee table.
Approach: Query the employee table by attempting an exact match on the full name field (employee.name = 'Fabbri Claudio'). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive matching, then substring matching (normalized to lowercase and trimmed), and then fuzzy matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings, name order variations (e.g., 'Claudio Fabbri'), or extra spaces. If multiple candidates are returned with similar scores, return all candidates with their match scores and mark multiple_matches = true to indicate ambiguity. If one clear best match is found above a reasonable confidence threshold, select that employee_id and mark found = true.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_name_input":{"type":"string"},"normalized_name":{"type":"string"},"employee_id":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"multiple_matches":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["employee_name_input","normalized_name","found","multiple_matches","candidate_employees"]}
**Result:** Successfully resolved the employee "Fabbri Claudio" to a unique employee ID. After comprehensive searching including exact matching, case-insensitive matching, substring matching, fuzzy matching, and semantic/logical matching (checking for reversed name order), only one candidate was found: "Claudio Fabbri" with employee ID QR23_036. The employee was verified to exist in the system with department "R&D and Technical Service" and location "HQ – Italy", which aligns with the R&D context mentioned in the task. No state-changing operations were performed; only read-only functions were used to query employee data.

{
  "employee_name_input": "Fabbri Claudio",
  "normalized_name": "Fabbri Claudio",
  "employee_id": "QR23_036",
  "found": true,
  "multiple_matches": false,
  "candidate_employees": [
    {
      "employee_id": "QR23_036",
      "name": "Claudio Fabbri",
      "match_score": 90.0
    }
  ]
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Identify all projects where the resolved employee is a team member and filter them by the project reference "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform" according to the mandatory time logging algorithm (Steps 1–3).
Approach: Assuming the prior step produced a unique employee_id for "Fabbri Claudio" (call this X), first retrieve all projects where X is in team_member.employee_id (JOIN team_member ON project.id = team_member.project_id) to obtain x_projects. Then filter x_projects by matching the project reference string 'R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform' against project.name or project.id, preferring exact matches first, then case-insensitive substring matches, then relaxed methods such as regex or FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible typos or slight naming differences (e.g., 'R&D Low VOC formulation platform', different dash characters). This produces x_projects_filtered. Since no customer reference is given in the task, skip the customer filtering part of the mandatory algorithm (Step 3) and keep x_projects_filtered unchanged. Compute n_filtered = len(x_projects_filtered) and retain basic data for each candidate project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_ref_input":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["project_id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["project_id","name"]}},"n_filtered":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","project_ref_input","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","n_filtered"]}

[ASSISTANT] (message 2)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I'll execute step 3: Find all projects where employee QR23_036 is a team member and filter by "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform".

Let me start by getting all projects for this employee and then filtering them.

```python
# First, let's get current context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, department: {ctx.department}")

# Employee ID from step 2
employee_id = "QR23_036"
print(f"Employee ID to search for: {employee_id}")

# Get all projects where this employee is a team member
# We need to paginate since limit is 5
all_projects = []
offset = 0
limit = 5

print("\nSearching for projects where employee is a team member...")
while True:
    projects_batch, next_offset = search_projects(team_employee=employee_id, offset=offset, limit=limit)
    print(f"Batch {offset//limit + 1}: Found {len(projects_batch)} projects")
    
    for p in projects_batch:
        print(f"  - {p.id}: {p.name} (Customer: {p.customer})")
    
    all_projects.extend(projects_batch)
    
    if next_offset == -1:
        break
    offset = next_offset

print(f"\nTotal projects found for employee {employee_id}: {len(all_projects)}")

# Now filter by project reference: "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform"
project_ref = "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform"
print(f"\nFiltering projects by reference: '{project_ref}'")

# Try different matching strategies
filtered_projects = []

# Strategy 1: Exact match in name
print("\n1. Checking for exact match in project.name...")
for p in all_projects:
    if p.name == project_ref:
        print(f"  Found exact match: {p.id}: {p.name}")
        filtered_projects.append(p)

# Strategy 2: Case-insensitive substring match
if not filtered_projects:
    print("\n2. Checking for case-insensitive substring match...")
    ref_lower = project_ref.lower()
    for p in all_projects:
        if ref_lower in p.name.lower():
            print(f"  Found substring match: {p.id}: {p.name}")
            filtered_projects.append(p)

# Strategy 3: Check if reference contains project ID
if not filtered_projects:
    print("\n3. Checking if reference contains project ID...")
    for p in all_projects:
        if p.id.lower() in project_ref.lower():
            print(f"  Found ID match: {p.id}: {p.name}")
            filtered_projects.append(p)

# Strategy 4: Fuzzy matching
if not filtered_projects:
    print("\n4. Trying fuzzy matching...")
    project_names = [p.name for p in all_projects]
    fuzzy_results = fuzzy_compare([project_ref], project_names, top_n=5)
    
    print("Fuzzy comparison results:")
    for result in fuzzy_results:
        print(f"  Target: '{result['target']}', Candidate: '{result['candidate']}', Ratio: {result['ratio']}")
        
        # Find the project with this name
        for p in all_projects:
            if p.name == result['candidate']:
                print(f"    Matched to project: {p.id}: {p.name}")
                filtered_projects.append(p)
                break

# Strategy 5: Try semantic/logical matching (relaxed)
if not filtered_projects:
    print("\n5. Trying semantic/logical matching...")
    
    # Remove common prefixes and normalize
    normalized_ref = project_ref.lower()
    # Remove "R&D – " prefix if present
    if normalized_ref.startswith("r&d – "):

Now I'll prepare the final output with the required structure. Based on the execution results, I have:

1. Employee ID: QR23_036
2. Project reference input: "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform"
3. All projects where the employee is a team member (x_projects): 2 projects
4. Filtered projects (x_projects_filtered): 1 project that exactly matches the reference
5. n_filtered: 1

Let me create the output:

```python
# Prepare the output according to expected schema
employee_id = "QR23_036"
project_ref_input = "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform"

# Format x_projects (all projects for this employee)
x_projects = []
for p in all_projects:
    x_projects.append({
        "project_id": p.id,
        "name": p.name,
        "customer_id": p.customer  # Customer field is the customer ID
    })

# Format x_projects_filtered (filtered projects)
x_projects_filtered = []
for p in filtered_projects:
    x_projects_filtered.append({
        "project_id": p.id,
        "name": p.name,
        "customer_id": p.customer  # Customer field is the customer ID
    })

n_filtered = len(filtered_projects)

# Create the final output
output = {
    "employee_id": employee_id,
    "project_ref_input": project_ref_input,
    "x_projects": x_projects,
    "x_projects_filtered": x_projects_filtered,
    "n_filtered": n_filtered
}

print("Final output:")
print(output)
```

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Identify all projects where the resolved employee is a team member and filter them by the project reference "R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform" according to the mandatory time logging algorithm (Steps 1–3).
Approach: Assuming the prior step produced a unique employee_id for "Fabbri Claudio" (call this X), first retrieve all projects where X is in team_member.employee_id (JOIN team_member ON project.id = team_member.project_id) to obtain x_projects. Then filter x_projects by matching the project reference string 'R&D – Low-VOC formulation platform' against project.name or project.id, preferring exact matches first, then case-insensitive substring matches, then relaxed methods such as regex or FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible typos or slight naming differences (e.g., 'R&D Low VOC formulation platform', different dash characters). This produces x_projects_filtered. Since no customer reference is given in the task, skip the customer filtering part of the mandatory algorithm (Step 3) and keep x_projects_filtered unchanged. Compute n_filtered = len(x_projects_filtered) and retain basic data for each candidate project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"project_ref_input":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["project_id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"project_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"anyOf":[{"type":"string"},{"type":"null"}]}},"required":["project_id","name"]}},"n_filtered":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","project_ref_input","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","n_filtered"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
