Successfully resolved the employee "Fabbri Claudio" to a unique employee ID. After comprehensive searching including exact matching, case-insensitive matching, substring matching, fuzzy matching, and semantic/logical matching (checking for reversed name order), only one candidate was found: "Claudio Fabbri" with employee ID QR23_036. The employee was verified to exist in the system with department "R&D and Technical Service" and location "HQ – Italy", which aligns with the R&D context mentioned in the task. No state-changing operations were performed; only read-only functions were used to query employee data.
