I have executed the step by calling the `who_am_i()` function to retrieve the authenticated user's identity. The function returns the following verified fields: employee_id (current_user), department, and location. I also retrieved the employee's name using `get_employee('CjTb_133')` to confirm the full name. However, the available functions (`who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`) do not provide a `system_roles` field. No other available function returns system roles. Therefore, I cannot retrieve system roles with the current API. The verified data is as follows:

- employee_id: "CjTb_133" (from who_am_i())
- name: "Salvatore Orlando" (from get_employee())
- department: "Human Resources (HR)" (from who_am_i() and get_employee())
- location: "HQ – Italy" (from who_am_i() and get_employee())
- system_roles: Cannot be retrieved; no function returns this information.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_133",
  "name": "Salvatore Orlando",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}
