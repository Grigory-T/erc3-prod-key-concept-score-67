Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Salvatore Orlando) and retrieve their detailed identity and system roles using a who_am_i() or equivalent function to understand permission boundaries before modifying any employee data.
Approach: Call the central identity or EmployeeRegistry who_am_i() endpoint for the current session to retrieve the bound employee identifier, full name, department, location, and system_roles for user id "CjTb_133". Do not perform any write operations in this step. This step does not require fuzzy search because the current user is determined by the authenticated session context, not by name matching.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"]}
