Step 2: Discover the available technical mechanisms (APIs, services, or direct database access) that allow updating an employee's will entries (employee_skill with skill_type = 'will') and employee notes, ensuring that such functionality is implemented.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and codebase references for terms like "employee profile update", "employee_skill API", "will management", "HR profile editing", and direct access patterns for the `employee` and `employee_skill` tables. Account for possible misspellings or naming variations (for example, "willingness_to_travel", "travel will", "mobility"). From this, determine whether there is (a) a dedicated HR UI or service API for editing employee skills/wills and notes, (b) an allowed direct SQL interface to update `employee_skill` and `employee.notes`, or (c) no supported mechanism. If no supported mechanism is found, mark the functionality as not implemented so that a later abort step can be executed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"has_employee_edit_api": {"type": "boolean"}, "has_direct_db_access": {"type": "boolean"}, "chosen_method": {"type": "string"}, "not_implemented": {"type": "boolean"}, "documentation_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["has_employee_edit_api", "has_direct_db_access", "chosen_method", "not_implemented"]}
