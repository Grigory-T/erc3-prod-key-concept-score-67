I have thoroughly executed Step 2 as instructed. My investigation included:

1. **Fuzzy and semantic searches** in the wiki for terms like "employee profile update", "employee_skill API", "will management", "HR profile editing", "willingness_to_travel", "travel will", "mobility", "direct SQL", and related terms.

2. **Examination of available API functions** which revealed only one employee update function: `update_employee_info()`.

3. **Documentation analysis** through loading wiki files, regex searches, and examining specific documentation.

4. **Verification of findings** through actual function returns - all data in the JSON response comes from explicitly printed function outputs.

The investigation confirms that employee will entries and notes can be updated via the `update_employee_info()` API function, which accepts `wills` and `notes` parameters. No direct database access mechanisms are available through the provided API functions.

{
  "has_employee_edit_api": true,
  "has_direct_db_access": false,
  "chosen_method": "update_employee_info() API function",
  "not_implemented": false,
  "documentation_sources": ["hr/skills_and_wills_model.md", "hr/example_employee_profiles.md", "company/organization_and_hierarchy.md", "systems/overview.md", "Available functions documentation"]
}
