## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-03-08
Current actor: Authenticated user CjTb_133
User details: {"id": "CjTb_133", "name": "Salvatore Orlando", "department": "Human Resources (HR)", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

```python
update_employee_info(employee_id, notes=None, salary=None, skills=None, wills=None, location=None, department=None, changed_by=None) -> object | None
# ⚠️ FULL REPLACE! Omitted fields get RESET.
# ⚠️ skills/wills MUST be list of dicts, NOT SkillLevel objects!
# Example:
#   old = get_employee(id)
#   skills_dicts = [{'name': s.name, 'level': s.level} for s in old.skills]
#   wills_dicts = [{'name': w.name, 'level': w.level} for w in old.wills]
#   update_employee_info(id, salary=new, notes=old.notes, skills=skills_dicts, 
#      wills=wills_dicts, location=old.location, department=old.department)


update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

[USER] (message 1)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: CjTb_133
department: Human Resources (HR)
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-03-08
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Please update Matteo Greco's profile: set their "Willingness to travel" will to level 9 and add a note that they completed an intensive customer visit training last week. Do not change their salary.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify the current authenticated user (Salvatore Orlando) and retrieve their detailed identity and system roles using a who_am_i() or equivalent function to understand permission boundaries before modifying any employee data.
Approach: Call the central identity or EmployeeRegistry who_am_i() endpoint for the current session to retrieve the bound employee identifier, full name, department, location, and system_roles for user id "CjTb_133". Do not perform any write operations in this step. This step does not require fuzzy search because the current user is determined by the authenticated session context, not by name matching.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "name": {"type": "string"}, "department": {"type": "string"}, "location": {"type": "string"}, "system_roles": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["employee_id", "name", "department", "location", "system_roles"]}
**Result:** I have executed the step by calling the `who_am_i()` function to retrieve the authenticated user's identity. The function returns the following verified fields: employee_id (current_user), department, and location. I also retrieved the employee's name using `get_employee('CjTb_133')` to confirm the full name. However, the available functions (`who_am_i()` and `get_employee()`) do not provide a `system_roles` field. No other available function returns system roles. Therefore, I cannot retrieve system roles with the current API. The verified data is as follows:

- employee_id: "CjTb_133" (from who_am_i())
- name: "Salvatore Orlando" (from get_employee())
- department: "Human Resources (HR)" (from who_am_i() and get_employee())
- location: "HQ – Italy" (from who_am_i() and get_employee())
- system_roles: Cannot be retrieved; no function returns this information.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_133",
  "name": "Salvatore Orlando",
  "department": "Human Resources (HR)",
  "location": "HQ – Italy",
  "system_roles": []
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Discover the available technical mechanisms (APIs, services, or direct database access) that allow updating an employee's will entries (employee_skill with skill_type = 'will') and employee notes, ensuring that such functionality is implemented.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and codebase references for terms like "employee profile update", "employee_skill API", "will management", "HR profile editing", and direct access patterns for the `employee` and `employee_skill` tables. Account for possible misspellings or naming variations (for example, "willingness_to_travel", "travel will", "mobility"). From this, determine whether there is (a) a dedicated HR UI or service API for editing employee skills/wills and notes, (b) an allowed direct SQL interface to update `employee_skill` and `employee.notes`, or (c) no supported mechanism. If no supported mechanism is found, mark the functionality as not implemented so that a later abort step can be executed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"has_employee_edit_api": {"type": "boolean"}, "has_direct_db_access": {"type": "boolean"}, "chosen_method": {"type": "string"}, "not_implemented": {"type": "boolean"}, "documentation_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["has_employee_edit_api", "has_direct_db_access", "chosen_method", "not_implemented"]}

<final_answer>
Based on my investigation of available technical documentation and API functions, I have discovered the following mechanisms for updating employee will entries and notes:

1. **Employee Edit API**: The `update_employee_info()` function is available and can update employee notes, skills, wills, location, department, and salary. This function requires passing the employee_id and can optionally update notes, skills, and wills (among other fields). Skills and wills must be provided as lists of dictionaries with 'name' and 'level' keys.

2. **Direct Database Access**: No direct SQL or database update mechanisms are exposed through the available API functions. While the wiki mentions database terms, there are no functions for executing raw SQL queries or direct table updates. All updates must go through the provided API functions.

3. **Documentation Sources**: I examined the wiki (19 files total) and found relevant documentation in:
   - `hr/skills_and_wills_model.md` - Explicitly mentions that "Employees and managers update skills and wills during annual reviews and as needed"
   - `hr/example_employee_profiles.md` - Shows example profiles with skills and wills
   - `company/organization_and_hierarchy.md` - Mentions skills and wills updates
   - `systems/overview.md` - Describes system architecture
   - Available functions documentation - Details the `update_employee_info()` API

4. **Implementation Status**: The functionality is implemented through the `update_employee_info()` API function, which supports updating employee wills and notes.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Discover the available technical mechanisms (APIs, services, or direct database access) that allow updating an employee's will entries (employee_skill with skill_type = 'will') and employee notes, ensuring that such functionality is implemented.
Approach: Perform a **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search in internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and codebase references for terms like "employee profile update", "employee_skill API", "will management", "HR profile editing", and direct access patterns for the `employee` and `employee_skill` tables. Account for possible misspellings or naming variations (for example, "willingness_to_travel", "travel will", "mobility"). From this, determine whether there is (a) a dedicated HR UI or service API for editing employee skills/wills and notes, (b) an allowed direct SQL interface to update `employee_skill` and `employee.notes`, or (c) no supported mechanism. If no supported mechanism is found, mark the functionality as not implemented so that a later abort step can be executed.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"has_employee_edit_api": {"type": "boolean"}, "has_direct_db_access": {"type": "boolean"}, "chosen_method": {"type": "string"}, "not_implemented": {"type": "boolean"}, "documentation_sources": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["has_employee_edit_api", "has_direct_db_access", "chosen_method", "not_implemented"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

Based on my verification, I confirm that I have:

1. **Executed the step instruction** exactly as specified by performing fuzzy and semantic/logical searches in the wiki and examining available API functions.

2. **Verified all facts from function returns** (not assumptions):
   - The `update_employee_info()` function exists and its signature was verified
   - 19 wiki files were listed and searched
   - Specific documentation files were loaded and examined
   - Fuzzy search results were obtained for all specified terms
   - Regex searches were performed
   - No direct database access functions were found in the available API

3. **Used only explicitly printed/verified data**:
   - All function calls and their outputs were printed
   - No data was invented or assumed
   - All conclusions are based on actual function returns

4. **Performed comprehensive searches**:
   - Fuzzy matching for variations of terms
   - Regular expression searches
   - Loading and examination of specific documentation files
   - Analysis of available API function signatures

5. **Did not perform any state-changing operations** - only read/query functions were used.

The verification confirms the initial findings are accurate.

<final_answer>
I have thoroughly executed Step 2 as instructed. My investigation included:

1. **Fuzzy and semantic searches** in the wiki for terms like "employee profile update", "employee_skill API", "will management", "HR profile editing", "willingness_to_travel", "travel will", "mobility", "direct SQL", and related terms.

2. **Examination of available API functions** which revealed only one employee update function: `update_employee_info()`.

3. **Documentation analysis** through loading wiki files, regex searches, and examining specific documentation.

4. **Verification of findings** through actual function returns - all data in the JSON response comes from explicitly printed function outputs.

The investigation confirms that employee will entries and notes can be updated via the `update_employee_info()` API function, which accepts `wills` and `notes` parameters. No direct database access mechanisms are available through the provided API functions.
