I have re-executed Step 4 with proper verification. The step requires calling "backend_permission_check or equivalent authorization mechanism" to verify permissions. However, after thorough checking:

1. There is NO `backend_permission_check` function available in the provided API functions.
2. System roles cannot be retrieved - the `get_employee()` function doesn't return a `system_roles` field, and no other function provides this information.
3. Despite being in the HR department, I cannot verify if Salvatore Orlando has the required 'HRAdmin' or 'Manager' system roles needed for the actions.

Based on the company rules, for AddWill/UpdateWillLevel/RemoveWill actions, the requirement is: `(user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø`. Since I cannot verify system_roles and the user is not the target employee, I cannot confirm these permissions.

For UpdateEmployeeNotes, the requirement is: `backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW`. Since this function doesn't exist, I cannot verify this permission.

Therefore, I cannot verify that the current user has permission to modify will entries and notes for Matteo Greco using the available functions. The permission check cannot be completed as instructed.

{
  "permitted_add_will": false,
  "permitted_update_will": false,
  "permitted_update_notes": false,
  "overall_allowed": false,
  "denial_reason": "Cannot verify permissions: backend_permission_check function not available and system_roles cannot be retrieved"
}
