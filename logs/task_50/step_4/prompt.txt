Step 4: Verify that the current user (from step 1) has permission to modify will entries and notes for the target employee (from step 3) using backend permission checks, without accessing or modifying salary.
Approach: Using the employee identifier of "Matteo Greco" from step 3 and the current user identity and system_roles from step 1, call the backend_permission_check or equivalent authorization mechanism for actions related to will and notes: `AddWill`, `UpdateWillLevel`, `RemoveWill` if needed, and `UpdateEmployeeNotes`. Ensure that this permission check respects company rules, including that salary data is not accessed (only skills/wills and notes are in scope). Do not perform any update here; only compute whether each action is permitted. If any required action is not allowed, record the denial so that a later step can abort the task as a security issue.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"permitted_add_will": {"type": "boolean"}, "permitted_update_will": {"type": "boolean"}, "permitted_update_notes": {"type": "boolean"}, "overall_allowed": {"type": "boolean"}, "denial_reason": {"type": "string"}}, "required": ["permitted_add_will", "permitted_update_will", "permitted_update_notes", "overall_allowed"]}
