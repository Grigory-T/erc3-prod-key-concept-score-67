Step 3: Locate the employee record corresponding to "Matteo Greco" in the employee registry to obtain their unique employee identifier without relying on salary information.
Approach: Query the `employee` table or EmployeeRegistry service using the name field. First try an exact match on `name = 'Matteo Greco'`. If not found or if multiple rows are returned, apply **FUZZY** and **SEMANTIC / LOGICAL** search over employee fields such as `name`, `id`, and `email` to handle potential typos, alternate spellings, or extra middle names (for example, "Matheo Greko", "M. Greco"). Use case-insensitive and partial matching (for example, lowercasing and checking if the search string is contained in the field), and as a last resort list all employees and filter by similarity. If multiple candidate employees remain with similar scores, mark the result as ambiguous so it can be resolved before proceeding.
Expected Output: {"type": "object", "properties": {"employee_id": {"type": "string"}, "found": {"type": "boolean"}, "multiple_matches": {"type": "boolean"}, "candidate_ids": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["found", "multiple_matches", "candidate_ids"]}
