I have successfully executed Step 3 according to the instructions. The employee record for "Matteo Greco" was located using an exact name search, which returned exactly one match. I verified the employee details by retrieving the full profile, confirming the unique employee identifier is "CjTb_003". No fuzzy or semantic search was needed as the exact match was successful, and no multiple matches were found. All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns that were explicitly printed during execution.

{
  "employee_id": "CjTb_003",
  "found": true,
  "multiple_matches": false,
  "candidate_ids": ["CjTb_003"]
}
