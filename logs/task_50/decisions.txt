DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:24:44
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
The step completed successfully: We have correctly retrieved the authenticated user's identifying information (employee_id, name, department, location) according to the plan. While the system_roles field could not be obtained due to limitations in the available API/functions, this was called out as an expected possibility in the step, and there is no evidence yet that it will prevent future progress. No other issues or missing functionality have been discovered. The next step prescribes to search for available technical mechanisms (API or direct DB access) to update wills/notes. There is no inconsistency or problem that warrants replanning; the plan remains valid and executable, so we should proceed.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:28:52
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps completed so far have returned relevant, correct, and expected results according to the original plan. There are no inconsistencies or missing functionalities at this stage. Step 3 can proceed as planned to locate Matteo Greco's employee record. No information so far suggests replanning or aborting; the plan is still valid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:31:12
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced results that match the expected outputs defined in the original plan. Each step returned correct and relevant data with no inconsistencies. The technical mechanism to update employee profiles is confirmed as available and supported (update_employee_info() API). The employee target ('Matteo Greco') is uniquely identified. There are no blocking issues or missing information. The next planned step is permission verification for HR actions on the target employee profile. Proceeding to the next step is fully justified by observed progress and plan alignment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 21:35:51
Decision: abort

Reasoning:
According to the original plan, Step 4 must confirm permissions for updating will entries and notes by using 'backend_permission_check or equivalent' and verifying system_roles. However, there is no function to perform a backend permission check, and no way to retrieve system_roles from the available APIs. The company policies require that all authorization decisions be based strictly on these verifications, not on inference. Since I cannot fulfill the precondition in Step 4, the workflow cannot reliably or compliantly proceed to any update operation. Therefore, it is necessary to abort, as the task cannot be completed under documented company rules and original plan requirements.
