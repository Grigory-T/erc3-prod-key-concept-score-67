Step 5: If a suitable technical implementation exists, the project has been uniquely identified, and the user has sufficient permissions, perform the update to set the project status to "paused".
Approach: Using the method determined in Step 2 and the project_id from Step 3, and assuming Step 4 granted permission, execute the update operation on the project record. For a Structured Query Language based implementation, this would typically involve a statement such as: UPDATE project SET status = 'paused', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = :project_id;. For an application programming interface based implementation, call the appropriate endpoint or method (for example, UpdateProjectStatus) with parameters project_id and new_status = 'paused'. Do not add or modify any other fields such as description unless explicitly required. Capture whether the operation succeeded, how many records were affected, and confirm the resulting status value for the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"success":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"new_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"affected_rows":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["success","affected_rows"]}
