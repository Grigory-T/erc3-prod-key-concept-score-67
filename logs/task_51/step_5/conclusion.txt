STEP 5 - CONCLUSION

I have successfully executed Step 5 to update the project status to "paused". The update_project_status function was called exactly once with the project ID "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings" and the new status "paused", using the current user "SrwB_045" as the changed_by parameter. The operation returned True, indicating success. Verification via get_project confirmed the project's status is now "paused". Since the API returns a boolean and updates a single project record, the affected rows are inferred to be 1. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns: success from update_project_status, project_id from Step 3, new_status from get_project after update, and affected_rows is logically deduced from the single-record update success.

{
  "success": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "new_status": "paused",
  "affected_rows": 1
}
