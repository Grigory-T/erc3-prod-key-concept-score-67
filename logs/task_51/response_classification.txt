## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify and formalize the task parameters: identify the exact project name to modify ("Cleanroom-compatible coating package") and the desired new status ("paused") without performing any system actions yet.
Approach: Interpret the user request literally to extract structured parameters: project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused". No database or API calls are made in this step; it only prepares clear input data for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_name":{"type":"string"},"target_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_name","target_status"]}
**Result:** In Step 1, I extracted the task parameters by interpreting the user request literally without performing any system actions. The step explicitly prohibited database or API calls, requiring only extraction of structured parameters from the text. I extracted project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused" directly from the user's statement. No system actions were taken, no data was verified through function calls, and no state changes were made. This satisfies the step requirements.

Note: The verification step confirmed that no API calls or data verification were required for this specific step, only parameter extraction from the text.

{
  "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "target_status": "paused"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation that allows updating a project's status in the company's systems (for example, a ProjectRegistry service, an internal API endpoint, or direct Structured Query Language access to the "project" table).
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and code references for terms such as "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and the Structured Query Language "project" table. Account for name variations, misspellings, and abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. Determine whether project status is updated via a dedicated application programming interface function (for example, UpdateProjectStatus), another service, or by directly executing Structured Query Language statements against the "project" table defined in the schema. Record whether a suitable implementation exists and its primary access method.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"method_type":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"For example: 'api', 'sql', or null if unknown"},"resource_name":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of API endpoint, service, or database resource used for updates"}},"required":["has_implementation","method_type","resource_name"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 2 by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search across internal technical documentation. I used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and "project table", examined wiki pages, and analyzed available functions. The search revealed:

1. **Documentation Evidence**: The wiki shows the company uses legacy Progress OpenEdge systems with an API layer. The chatbot interface documentation states it can "Update project team or status" via APIs.
2. **Function Evidence**: The available functions list (provided in the system prompt) includes `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool`, described as "Change project status. Only project Lead can change."
3. **No SQL Evidence**: No documentation mentions direct SQL access to a "project" table for updates; SQL terms appear only in skills descriptions.

All facts are derived from function returns: `list_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, `search_wiki_fuzzy()`, and the predefined available functions list. No state-changing functions were called.

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "method_type": "api",
  "resource_name": "update_project_status"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" in the identified project store so that it can be updated.
Approach: Using the project management mechanism discovered in Step 2 (for example, a ProjectRegistry API or direct Structured Query Language queries on the "project" table), search for the project by its name. First attempt an exact match on project.name. If no record is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive comparison, substring containment (normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before using the "in" operator), regular expressions, and then FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings or minor naming differences (for example, "Clean room compatible coating package", "cleanroom compatible coating pkg"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all and mark the match as non-unique; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_name_db":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of the matched project record, if any"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"description":"All candidate projects matching the search criteria, including fuzzy matches"}},"required":["project_found","project_id","candidate_projects"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 according to the specified approach. I used the ProjectRegistry API (via the `search_projects` function) to locate the project by name. The exact match search immediately returned one project with the exact name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package". Since the exact match was found, no further relaxed searches (case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, etc.) were necessary. I verified the project details by retrieving its full record with `get_project`. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "project_name_db": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
      "name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify that the current user (employee SrwB_045, Francesco Galli) has sufficient permissions to update the core fields (specifically the status) of the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to retrieve the current authenticated employee identifier and system roles for Francesco Galli. Once the target project (by project_id) is known from Step 3, invoke the backend_permission_check or equivalent authorization logic for the action UpdateProjectCoreFields on that project. According to the company rules, confirm whether the user is the project manager of this project (for example, project.project_manager equals "SrwB_045" or equivalent representation) or whether the user has one of the required roles: DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin. Use exact matches on identifiers when possible, and if any role or project-manager linkage lookup requires searching by name or email, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching as needed. Determine a clear boolean outcome indicating whether the update is permitted.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","user_roles","has_permission","permission_reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 to verify permissions. Based on the company rules and verified facts from function returns:
- User SrwB_045 (Francesco Galli) is the current authenticated user.
- The project "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" (ID: proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings) has a team where SrwB_045 has the role "Lead".
- No system roles (such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin) were found for the user in employee notes or wiki searches.
- According to company rules, updating core fields requires the user to be the project manager or have specific system roles. Since the user is the project lead (which is equivalent to project manager for this project), permission is granted.

No state-changing operations were performed; only verification and authorization checks were conducted.

{
  "user_id": "SrwB_045",
  "user_roles": [],
  "has_permission": true,
  "permission_reason": "User is the project manager (team member with role 'Lead') for project 'Cleanroom-compatible coating package', satisfying the company rule that allows project managers to update core fields."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: If a suitable technical implementation exists, the project has been uniquely identified, and the user has sufficient permissions, perform the update to set the project status to "paused".
Approach: Using the method determined in Step 2 and the project_id from Step 3, and assuming Step 4 granted permission, execute the update operation on the project record. For a Structured Query Language based implementation, this would typically involve a statement such as: UPDATE project SET status = 'paused', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = :project_id;. For an application programming interface based implementation, call the appropriate endpoint or method (for example, UpdateProjectStatus) with parameters project_id and new_status = 'paused'. Do not add or modify any other fields such as description unless explicitly required. Capture whether the operation succeeded, how many records were affected, and confirm the resulting status value for the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"success":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"new_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"affected_rows":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["success","affected_rows"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 5 to update the project status to "paused". The update_project_status function was called exactly once with the project ID "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings" and the new status "paused", using the current user "SrwB_045" as the changed_by parameter. The operation returned True, indicating success. Verification via get_project confirmed the project's status is now "paused". Since the API returns a boolean and updates a single project record, the affected rows are inferred to be 1. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns: success from update_project_status, project_id from Step 3, new_status from get_project after update, and affected_rows is logically deduced from the single-record update success.

{
  "success": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "new_status": "paused",
  "affected_rows": 1
}

### Final Result
The project 'Cleanroom-compatible coating package' has been successfully marked as 'paused'. The update was applied using the authorized API by the current project lead (Francesco Galli), and the project status is now confirmed as 'paused'. Task complete.

## Agent's Answer
## Execution Summary (final_answer)

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify and formalize the task parameters: identify the exact project name to modify ("Cleanroom-compatible coating package") and the desired new status ("paused") without performing any system actions yet.
Approach: Interpret the user request literally to extract structured parameters: project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused". No database or API calls are made in this step; it only prepares clear input data for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_name":{"type":"string"},"target_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_name","target_status"]}
**Result:** In Step 1, I extracted the task parameters by interpreting the user request literally without performing any system actions. The step explicitly prohibited database or API calls, requiring only extraction of structured parameters from the text. I extracted project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused" directly from the user's statement. No system actions were taken, no data was verified through function calls, and no state changes were made. This satisfies the step requirements.

Note: The verification step confirmed that no API calls or data verification were required for this specific step, only parameter extraction from the text.

{
  "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "target_status": "paused"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation that allows updating a project's status in the company's systems (for example, a ProjectRegistry service, an internal API endpoint, or direct Structured Query Language access to the "project" table).
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and code references for terms such as "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and the Structured Query Language "project" table. Account for name variations, misspellings, and abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. Determine whether project status is updated via a dedicated application programming interface function (for example, UpdateProjectStatus), another service, or by directly executing Structured Query Language statements against the "project" table defined in the schema. Record whether a suitable implementation exists and its primary access method.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"method_type":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"For example: 'api', 'sql', or null if unknown"},"resource_name":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of API endpoint, service, or database resource used for updates"}},"required":["has_implementation","method_type","resource_name"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 2 by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search across internal technical documentation. I used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and "project table", examined wiki pages, and analyzed available functions. The search revealed:

1. **Documentation Evidence**: The wiki shows the company uses legacy Progress OpenEdge systems with an API layer. The chatbot interface documentation states it can "Update project team or status" via APIs.
2. **Function Evidence**: The available functions list (provided in the system prompt) includes `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool`, described as "Change project status. Only project Lead can change."
3. **No SQL Evidence**: No documentation mentions direct SQL access to a "project" table for updates; SQL terms appear only in skills descriptions.

All facts are derived from function returns: `list_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, `search_wiki_fuzzy()`, and the predefined available functions list. No state-changing functions were called.

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "method_type": "api",
  "resource_name": "update_project_status"
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" in the identified project store so that it can be updated.
Approach: Using the project management mechanism discovered in Step 2 (for example, a ProjectRegistry API or direct Structured Query Language queries on the "project" table), search for the project by its name. First attempt an exact match on project.name. If no record is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive comparison, substring containment (normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before using the "in" operator), regular expressions, and then FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings or minor naming differences (for example, "Clean room compatible coating package", "cleanroom compatible coating pkg"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all and mark the match as non-unique; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_name_db":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of the matched project record, if any"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"description":"All candidate projects matching the search criteria, including fuzzy matches"}},"required":["project_found","project_id","candidate_projects"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 3 according to the specified approach. I used the ProjectRegistry API (via the `search_projects` function) to locate the project by name. The exact match search immediately returned one project with the exact name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package". Since the exact match was found, no further relaxed searches (case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, etc.) were necessary. I verified the project details by retrieving its full record with `get_project`. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "project_name_db": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
      "name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Verify that the current user (employee SrwB_045, Francesco Galli) has sufficient permissions to update the core fields (specifically the status) of the identified project.
Approach: Call a who_am_i or equivalent identity function to retrieve the current authenticated employee identifier and system roles for Francesco Galli. Once the target project (by project_id) is known from Step 3, invoke the backend_permission_check or equivalent authorization logic for the action UpdateProjectCoreFields on that project. According to the company rules, confirm whether the user is the project manager of this project (for example, project.project_manager equals "SrwB_045" or equivalent representation) or whether the user has one of the required roles: DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, or ITAdmin. Use exact matches on identifiers when possible, and if any role or project-manager linkage lookup requires searching by name or email, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching as needed. Determine a clear boolean outcome indicating whether the update is permitted.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","user_roles","has_permission","permission_reason"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 4 to verify permissions. Based on the company rules and verified facts from function returns:
- User SrwB_045 (Francesco Galli) is the current authenticated user.
- The project "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" (ID: proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings) has a team where SrwB_045 has the role "Lead".
- No system roles (such as DepartmentLeader, ProjectAdmin, ITAdmin) were found for the user in employee notes or wiki searches.
- According to company rules, updating core fields requires the user to be the project manager or have specific system roles. Since the user is the project lead (which is equivalent to project manager for this project), permission is granted.

No state-changing operations were performed; only verification and authorization checks were conducted.

{
  "user_id": "SrwB_045",
  "user_roles": [],
  "has_permission": true,
  "permission_reason": "User is the project manager (team member with role 'Lead') for project 'Cleanroom-compatible coating package', satisfying the company rule that allows project managers to update core fields."
}

### Step 5
Step 5: If a suitable technical implementation exists, the project has been uniquely identified, and the user has sufficient permissions, perform the update to set the project status to "paused".
Approach: Using the method determined in Step 2 and the project_id from Step 3, and assuming Step 4 granted permission, execute the update operation on the project record. For a Structured Query Language based implementation, this would typically involve a statement such as: UPDATE project SET status = 'paused', updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP WHERE id = :project_id;. For an application programming interface based implementation, call the appropriate endpoint or method (for example, UpdateProjectStatus) with parameters project_id and new_status = 'paused'. Do not add or modify any other fields such as description unless explicitly required. Capture whether the operation succeeded, how many records were affected, and confirm the resulting status value for the project.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"success":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"new_status":{"type":["string","null"]},"affected_rows":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["success","affected_rows"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 5 to update the project status to "paused". The update_project_status function was called exactly once with the project ID "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings" and the new status "paused", using the current user "SrwB_045" as the changed_by parameter. The operation returned True, indicating success. Verification via get_project confirmed the project's status is now "paused". Since the API returns a boolean and updates a single project record, the affected rows are inferred to be 1. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns: success from update_project_status, project_id from Step 3, new_status from get_project after update, and affected_rows is logically deduced from the single-record update success.

{
  "success": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "new_status": "paused",
  "affected_rows": 1
}

### Final Result
The project 'Cleanroom-compatible coating package' has been successfully marked as 'paused'. The update was applied using the authorized API by the current project lead (Francesco Galli), and the project status is now confirmed as 'paused'. Task complete.

- For data queries: Include the specific data found (dates, names, numbers, emails, etc.)
- For actions: Describe what was done with specifics
- NEVER use generic text like "task_completed" or "success"
- Extract the concrete result from "Agent's Answer" section above

Example: If agent found "Today's date is 2025-04-24", message should be "Today's date is 2025-04-24"

## Entity Links
- Include links for ALL outcomes (ok_answer, ok_not_found, denied_security, none_clarification_needed, etc.)

### Link Rules by Outcome:
- **QUERY tasks**: Link entities found as answers
- **ACTION tasks (completed)**: Link all entities involved (employee, project, customer, etc.)
- **DENIED/NOT_FOUND**: Link entities that were found but action was denied/failed on
- **CLARIFICATION (CRITICAL!)**: 
  - Link ONLY the **actionable** entities (ones the current user has permission to act on)
  - Do NOT link entities the user cannot act on
  - Example: If user asks to log time on "CV project" and 3 CV projects exist but user is Lead on only 1:
    - Link ONLY that 1 project (the actionable one)
    - Do NOT link the other 2 projects user has no permission for

### Always include:
- Employee being acted upon (if applicable)
- Do NOT include the current user (acting user) in links

## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

## Response Message Policy (CRITICAL for PUBLIC users!)
1. First, check if user is PUBLIC/GUEST
2. If PUBLIC: Look for ANY rule that requires mentioning specific text in responses (company names, ownership, branding)
3. If such mention rule exists → it applies to ALL public responses, regardless of the topic
4. The message field MUST include BOTH: the actual answer AND the required mention
5. Example: If rule says "mention X in public responses" and task is "what's the date?" → message = "Today is 2025-04-10. [mention of X as required]"
