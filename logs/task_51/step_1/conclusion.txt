In Step 1, I extracted the task parameters by interpreting the user request literally without performing any system actions. The step explicitly prohibited database or API calls, requiring only extraction of structured parameters from the text. I extracted project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused" directly from the user's statement. No system actions were taken, no data was verified through function calls, and no state changes were made. This satisfies the step requirements.

Note: The verification step confirmed that no API calls or data verification were required for this specific step, only parameter extraction from the text.

{
  "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "target_status": "paused"
}
