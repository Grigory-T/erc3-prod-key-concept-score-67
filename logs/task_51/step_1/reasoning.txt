We are in Step 1. The step description says: "Clarify and formalize the task parameters: identify the exact project name to modify ("Cleanroom-compatible coating package") and the desired new status ("paused") without performing any system actions yet."

We are to extract structured parameters from the user request. The user request is: "Please mark project Cleanroom-compatible coating package as paused for now. We expect to resume later this year."

Thus:
project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
target_status = "paused"

No API calls. Just output a JSON with these parameters.

Note: The expected output schema is given.

So we output:
{
  "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "target_status": "paused"
}

We must output this in <final_answer> and <json> tags.

Since no actions are performed, we can directly provide the answer.

We are only in Step 1, which explicitly says: "Clarify and formalize the task parameters ... without performing any system actions yet."
 We are to interpret the user request literally and extract structured parameters.
 The user request in the GLOBAL TASK is: "Please mark project Cleanroom-compatible coating package as paused for now. We expect to resume later this year."
 Therefore, we extract:
   project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
   target_status = "paused"

 We are not to make any API calls or database queries in this step.

 The expected output format is a JSON object with properties "project_name" and "target_status".

 We have already done that in the previous response.

 However, note that the verification message asks us to confirm we did not skip any actions and that we did not use any made-up data.

 Since no API calls were made, we are just extracting from the user's text. This is acceptable for this step.

 Let's reiterate:

 We have:
   project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
   target_status = "paused"

 We are not required to verify the existence of the project or the validity of the status in this step.

 Therefore, we can repeat the same JSON.
