Step 1: Clarify and formalize the task parameters: identify the exact project name to modify ("Cleanroom-compatible coating package") and the desired new status ("paused") without performing any system actions yet.
Approach: Interpret the user request literally to extract structured parameters: project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused". No database or API calls are made in this step; it only prepares clear input data for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_name":{"type":"string"},"target_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_name","target_status"]}
