Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" in the identified project store so that it can be updated.
Approach: Using the project management mechanism discovered in Step 2 (for example, a ProjectRegistry API or direct Structured Query Language queries on the "project" table), search for the project by its name. First attempt an exact match on project.name. If no record is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive comparison, substring containment (normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before using the "in" operator), regular expressions, and then FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings or minor naming differences (for example, "Clean room compatible coating package", "cleanroom compatible coating pkg"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all and mark the match as non-unique; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_name_db":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of the matched project record, if any"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"description":"All candidate projects matching the search criteria, including fuzzy matches"}},"required":["project_found","project_id","candidate_projects"]}
