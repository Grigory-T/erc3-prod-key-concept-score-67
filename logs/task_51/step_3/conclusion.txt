I have successfully executed Step 3 according to the specified approach. I used the ProjectRegistry API (via the `search_projects` function) to locate the project by name. The exact match search immediately returned one project with the exact name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package". Since the exact match was found, no further relaxed searches (case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, etc.) were necessary. I verified the project details by retrieving its full record with `get_project`. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "project_found": true,
  "project_id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
  "project_name_db": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "candidate_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_helvetic_cleanroom_coatings",
      "name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
    }
  ]
}
