## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-02-26
Current actor: Authenticated user SrwB_045
User details: {"id": "SrwB_045", "name": "Francesco Galli", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

# Change project status. Only project Lead can change.

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## Current User Context (who_am_i) - **as an assistant you acting on behalf of this User**
current_user: SrwB_045
department: R&D and Technical Service
location: HQ – Italy
today date: 2025-02-26
is_public: False

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Please mark project Cleanroom-compatible coating package as paused for now. We expect to resume later this year.

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Clarify and formalize the task parameters: identify the exact project name to modify ("Cleanroom-compatible coating package") and the desired new status ("paused") without performing any system actions yet.
Approach: Interpret the user request literally to extract structured parameters: project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused". No database or API calls are made in this step; it only prepares clear input data for subsequent steps.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_name":{"type":"string"},"target_status":{"type":"string"}},"required":["project_name","target_status"]}
**Result:** In Step 1, I extracted the task parameters by interpreting the user request literally without performing any system actions. The step explicitly prohibited database or API calls, requiring only extraction of structured parameters from the text. I extracted project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" and target_status = "paused" directly from the user's statement. No system actions were taken, no data was verified through function calls, and no state changes were made. This satisfies the step requirements.

Note: The verification step confirmed that no API calls or data verification were required for this specific step, only parameter extraction from the text.

{
  "project_name": "Cleanroom-compatible coating package",
  "target_status": "paused"
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation that allows updating a project's status in the company's systems (for example, a ProjectRegistry service, an internal API endpoint, or direct Structured Query Language access to the "project" table).
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and code references for terms such as "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and the Structured Query Language "project" table. Account for name variations, misspellings, and abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. Determine whether project status is updated via a dedicated application programming interface function (for example, UpdateProjectStatus), another service, or by directly executing Structured Query Language statements against the "project" table defined in the schema. Record whether a suitable implementation exists and its primary access method.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"method_type":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"For example: 'api', 'sql', or null if unknown"},"resource_name":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of API endpoint, service, or database resource used for updates"}},"required":["has_implementation","method_type","resource_name"]}
**Result:** I executed Step 2 by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search across internal technical documentation. I used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and "project table", examined wiki pages, and analyzed available functions. The search revealed:

1. **Documentation Evidence**: The wiki shows the company uses legacy Progress OpenEdge systems with an API layer. The chatbot interface documentation states it can "Update project team or status" via APIs.
2. **Function Evidence**: The available functions list (provided in the system prompt) includes `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool`, described as "Change project status. Only project Lead can change."
3. **No SQL Evidence**: No documentation mentions direct SQL access to a "project" table for updates; SQL terms appear only in skills descriptions.

All facts are derived from function returns: `list_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, `search_wiki_fuzzy()`, and the predefined available functions list. No state-changing functions were called.

{
  "has_implementation": true,
  "method_type": "api",
  "resource_name": "update_project_status"
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" in the identified project store so that it can be updated.
Approach: Using the project management mechanism discovered in Step 2 (for example, a ProjectRegistry API or direct Structured Query Language queries on the "project" table), search for the project by its name. First attempt an exact match on project.name. If no record is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive comparison, substring containment (normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before using the "in" operator), regular expressions, and then FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings or minor naming differences (for example, "Clean room compatible coating package", "cleanroom compatible coating pkg"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all and mark the match as non-unique; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_name_db":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of the matched project record, if any"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"description":"All candidate projects matching the search criteria, including fuzzy matches"}},"required":["project_found","project_id","candidate_projects"]}

I'll help locate the specific project record for "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" using the project management functions available. Let me start by checking who I am and then search for the project.

```python
# First, check current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, Department: {ctx.department}, Location: {ctx.location}")

# Define the project name we're looking for
project_name = "Cleanroom-compatible coating package"
print(f"Searching for project: '{project_name}'")
```

Now I'll search for the project using the available project management functions. I'll start by trying to find an exact match.

```python
# First, let's try searching with the exact name

Now I'll verify this is indeed the correct project by getting its full details and prepare the output according to the expected format.

```python
# Get the full project details to confirm
project_id = projects[0].id
project_full = get_project(project_id)

if project_full:
    print(f"Verified project details:")
    print(f"  ID: {project_full.id}")
    print(f"  Name: {project_full.name}")
    print(f"  Customer: {project_full.customer}")
    print(f"  Status: {project_full.status}")
    print(f"  Description: {project_full.description[:100]}..." if project_full.description else "  Description: None")
    
    # Prepare the output
    project_found = True
    project_id_db = project_full.id
    project_name_db = project_full.name
    
    # Create candidate projects list
    candidate_projects = []
    for proj in projects:
        candidate_projects.append({
            "id": proj.id,
            "name": proj.name
        })
else:
    print("ERROR: Could not retrieve full project details")
    project_found = False
    project_id_db = None
    project_name_db = None
    candidate_projects = []

print("\n" + "="*50)
print("FINAL RESULTS:")
print(f"Project found: {project_found}")
print(f"Project ID: {project_id_db}")
print(f"Project name in DB: {project_name_db}")
print(f"Candidate projects: {len(candidate_projects)}")
for cp in candidate_projects:
    print(f"  - {cp['id']}: {cp['name']}")

<final_answer>
I have successfully located the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package". Using the ProjectRegistry API, I performed a search for the project by its name. The exact match search returned one project with the exact name we were looking for. I verified the project details by retrieving its full information. The project exists in the system and is ready for status update in the next step.

No state-changing operations were performed in this step; only read operations were used to locate and verify the project record.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Locate the specific project record corresponding to the name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package" in the identified project store so that it can be updated.
Approach: Using the project management mechanism discovered in Step 2 (for example, a ProjectRegistry API or direct Structured Query Language queries on the "project" table), search for the project by its name. First attempt an exact match on project.name. If no record is found, progressively relax the search by using case-insensitive comparison, substring containment (normalizing strings to lowercase and trimming whitespace before using the "in" operator), regular expressions, and then FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching to account for possible misspellings or minor naming differences (for example, "Clean room compatible coating package", "cleanroom compatible coating pkg"). If multiple candidate projects are found, list them all and mark the match as non-unique; if none are found, mark the project as not found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_found":{"type":"boolean"},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_name_db":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of the matched project record, if any"},"candidate_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]},"description":"All candidate projects matching the search criteria, including fuzzy matches"}},"required":["project_found","project_id","candidate_projects"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have successfully executed Step 3 according to the specified approach. I used the ProjectRegistry API (via the `search_projects` function) to locate the project by name. The exact match search immediately returned one project with the exact name "Cleanroom-compatible coating package". Since the exact match was found, no further relaxed searches (case-insensitive, substring, fuzzy, etc.) were necessary. I verified the project details by retrieving its full record with `get_project`. All facts in the JSON output are derived from function returns, and no state-changing operations were performed.
