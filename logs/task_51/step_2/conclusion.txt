I executed Step 2 by performing a comprehensive fuzzy and semantic search across internal technical documentation. I used `search_wiki_fuzzy` with terms like "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and "project table", examined wiki pages, and analyzed available functions. The search revealed:

1. **Documentation Evidence**: The wiki shows the company uses legacy Progress OpenEdge systems with an API layer. The chatbot interface documentation states it can "Update project team or status" via APIs.
2. **Function Evidence**: The available functions list (provided in the system prompt) includes `update_project_status(project_id, status, changed_by=None) -> bool`, described as "Change project status. Only project Lead can change."
3. **No SQL Evidence**: No documentation mentions direct SQL access to a "project" table for updates; SQL terms appear only in skills descriptions.

All facts are derived from function returns: `list_wiki()`, `load_wiki()`, `search_wiki_fuzzy()`, and the predefined available functions list. No state-changing functions were called.
