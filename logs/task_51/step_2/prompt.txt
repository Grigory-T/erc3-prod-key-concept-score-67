Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation that allows updating a project's status in the company's systems (for example, a ProjectRegistry service, an internal API endpoint, or direct Structured Query Language access to the "project" table).
Approach: Perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search across internal technical documentation, service catalogs, and code references for terms such as "ProjectRegistry", "project status update", "update project", and the Structured Query Language "project" table. Account for name variations, misspellings, and abbreviations using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity. Determine whether project status is updated via a dedicated application programming interface function (for example, UpdateProjectStatus), another service, or by directly executing Structured Query Language statements against the "project" table defined in the schema. Record whether a suitable implementation exists and its primary access method.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"has_implementation":{"type":"boolean"},"method_type":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"For example: 'api', 'sql', or null if unknown"},"resource_name":{"type":["string","null"],"description":"Name of API endpoint, service, or database resource used for updates"}},"required":["has_implementation","method_type","resource_name"]}
