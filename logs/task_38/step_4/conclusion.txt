Completed: 2025-12-10 00:14:22

I have successfully executed Step 4 as instructed. All facts were verified through direct function calls without assumptions:

1. **User Identity Verified**: Called `who_am_i()` to confirm current user is BwFV_001 (Manuela Valli), department: Corporate Leadership, location: HQ – Italy, authenticated (not public).

2. **Employee Record Verified**: Retrieved full employee record via `get_employee("BwFV_001")` to confirm user details including name, email, department, and location.

3. **CRM Access Tested**: Successfully retrieved the EuroFlooring customer record via `get_customer("cust_euro_flooring")`, confirming the user can access customer data including the primary_contact_email field (peter.devries@euroflooring.com).

4. **Permission Analysis**: Applied company rules which state that reading CRM customer records is permitted for non-mutating actions, and Corporate Leadership department has executive-level access.

All data in the JSON response comes directly from function returns. No state-changing operations were performed.
