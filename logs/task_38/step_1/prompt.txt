Step 1: Search internal documentation and wiki files to understand how external logistics or flooring operators such as "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands are categorized (for example, customer, supplier, partner) and which internal system typically stores their contact email information.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file entries and any available internal documentation for terms and variants like "EuroFlooring", "Euro Flooring", "logistics floor operator", "flooring logistics", and "Netherlands". Account for possible typos and misspellings (for example, "Eurofloring", "Euro-flooring") by using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity search (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy). From the best-matching documents, extract which master system (for example, CRM customer table, a dedicated vendor registry, or other) is indicated as the authoritative place for storing contact emails of such external operators.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"vendor_contact_storage_system":{"type":"string"},"found_in_wiki":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["vendor_contact_storage_system","found_in_wiki"]}
