I have executed Step 1 as instructed, performing a comprehensive search of internal wiki documentation. I used fuzzy search (search_wiki_fuzzy) with terms including "EuroFlooring", "logistics floor operator", "flooring logistics", and "Netherlands", as well as regex searches and detailed examination of relevant wiki files. The search revealed that the CRM system is documented as the central repository for customer master data and contact emails, but no documentation was found regarding where vendor, supplier, or partner contact emails are stored. No references to "EuroFlooring" or similar logistics floor operators were found. No state-changing operations were performed.

{"vendor_contact_storage_system": "", "found_in_wiki": false}
