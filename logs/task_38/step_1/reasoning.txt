--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are in Step 1 of the global task. The step is to search internal documentation and wiki files to understand how external logistics or flooring operators such as "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands are categorized and which internal system stores their contact email information.

 We are to use fuzzy and semantic search over wiki files for terms and variants. We'll use the available functions: `search_wiki_fuzzy`, `list_wiki`, `load_wiki`, and possibly `fuzzy_find_in_text` and `fuzzy_compare`.

 Steps:
 1. List all wiki files to know what we have.
 2. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of terms and variants.
 3. Analyze the results to find relevant documents.
 4. From the best matches, extract information about the master system (CRM, vendor registry, etc.) for storing contact emails.

 Note: We are only allowed to use the provided functions. We must print the results of each function call.

 Let's start by listing the wiki files to see what we are working with.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #2] 2025-12-09 23:59:23
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are given a list of wiki files. We need to search for information about "EuroFlooring" or similar terms.
 We will use fuzzy search on the wiki content to find relevant documents.

 Steps:
 1. We have a list of target terms: "EuroFlooring", "Euro Flooring", "logistics floor operator", "flooring logistics", "Netherlands"
 2. We also consider possible typos: "Eurofloring", "Euro-flooring", etc.

 Approach:
 - Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of target words. We can break down the terms into individual words and also use multi-word terms.

 However, note that `search_wiki_fuzzy` takes a list of words and searches for each word in the wiki.

 Alternatively, we can use `fuzzy_find_in_text` by loading each wiki file and searching in the text.

 But we have 19 files. Let's try to use `search_wiki_fuzzy` first for efficiency.

 We'll create a list of search terms (words) from the given phrases by splitting and also including the whole phrases.

 But note: `search_wiki_fuzzy` is for words, not phrases. So we might have to split the phrases.

 Alternatively, we can use `fuzzy_find_in_text` by loading each wiki file and searching for the phrases.

 Let's try both:

 Plan:
 1. Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` with a list of words extracted from the target terms.
 2. Also, we can use `fuzzy_find_in_text` for each wiki file with the target phrases.

 However, we are allowed to use the available functions.

 Let's start by using `search_wiki_fuzzy` with the following words:
   - "EuroFlooring", "Euro", "Flooring", "logistics", "operator", "Netherlands", "vendor", "supplier", "partner"

 But note: the function `search_wiki_fuzzy` returns matches for each word. We might get too many results.

 We can also try to load each wiki file and use `fuzzy_find_in_text` for the phrases.

 Let's do:

 Step 1: Use `search_wiki_fuzzy` for the words and see the top matches.

 Step 2: Load the wiki files that are most relevant (based on the fuzzy search) and then search for the phrases.

 We are looking for which system stores contact emails: CRM, vendor registry, etc.

 We'll also look for terms like "contact email", "storage system", "master data", "vendor contact", etc.

 Let's execute.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #3] 2025-12-10 00:00:15
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to focus on the specific question: where are contact emails of external logistics or flooring operators stored? The fuzzy search gave many results, but we need to look at the content of relevant files to extract the information about the master system for storing contact emails.

From the regex search, it didn't return any results (maybe because the patterns were too specific). Let's load the most relevant files and search for terms like "vendor", "supplier", "partner", and also look for explicit statements about where contact information is stored.

We saw that the CRM system is mentioned in several files. Also, note that the task is about an external logistics floor operator in the Netherlands. Possibly, such operators might be treated as customers, suppliers, or partners. We need to find out which system stores their contact emails.

Let's examine the CRM file and other files more thoroughly. We'll search for "vendor", "supplier", "partner", and also for "Netherlands" to see if there is any specific documentation about how such entities are categorized.

We can also use the fuzzy search results to get specific lines from the CRM file and other relevant files. Let's look at the fuzzy matches for the CRM file and other key files.

But note: the fuzzy search results are in `fuzzy_results`. We can filter them to see matches for specific terms and in specific files.

Alternatively, we can load the content of the most relevant files and search within them.

Let's start by loading the CRM file and looking for information about vendors/suppliers.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #4] 2025-12-10 00:00:57
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to find out how external logistics or flooring operators are categorized and where their contact emails are stored.
 From the wiki search, we've seen that the CRM system is the central repository for customer master data. However, we haven't found explicit references to vendors, suppliers, or partners.

 Let's search more specifically for "vendor", "supplier", "partner" in the wiki files, and also look for any system that might store their contact emails.

 We'll also check the "operations/factories_and_production.md" file more thoroughly.

 Since the fuzzy search didn't yield clear results, let's do a more targeted search by loading each relevant file and looking for keywords.

 We'll also check the "systems/overview.md" to see if there's a vendor registry mentioned.

 Let's write a function to search for keywords in a file and return lines that contain them. We'll do this for a few key files.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #5] 2025-12-10 00:02:11
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have examined the wiki and found that the CRM system is described as the "central repository for customer master data". However, we are looking for information about external logistics or flooring operators (like EuroFlooring) which might be categorized as vendors, suppliers, or partners.

From the CRM documentation, it clearly states that it is for "customer company" and "opportunity / relationship". There is no mention of vendors, suppliers, or partners in the CRM documentation.

We also searched for "vendor", "supplier", and "partner" in the wiki and found matches in various files, but no specific system is indicated for storing vendor contact emails.

Let's check the "business/markets_and_customers.md" file more thoroughly for any mention of how external operators are managed.

```python
# Let's load the entire markets_and_customers file and search for any system references
print("=== FULL EXAMINATION OF MARKETS AND CUSTOMERS ===")
markets_content = load_wiki("business/markets_and_customers.md")
if markets_content:
    lines = markets_content.split('\n')
    
    # Look for any mention of systems, CRM, or storage of contact information
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if any(term in line.lower() for term in ['system', 'crm', 'store', 'repository', 'database', 'contact', 'email']):
            print(f"Line {i+1}: {line}")
    
    # Also, look for any mention of vendor/supplier/partner management
    print("\n--- Looking for vendor/supplier/partner management ---")
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if any(term in line.lower() for term in ['vendor', 'supplier', 'partner', 'external operator', 'third party']):
            print(f"Line {i+1}: {line}")
```

We also note that the company has a Rotterdam office in the Netherlands, which might be relevant for logistics operations.

Since we are looking for a "logistics floor operator" in the Netherlands, it might be a vendor or supplier. The CRM system is explicitly for customers, not vendors.

Let's check if there is any other system mentioned in the wiki for non-customer entities. We saw in the knowledge base that the wiki is not a replacement for transactional data (like CRM entries). But we haven't found a dedicated vendor registry.

Given the information we have, it's possible that vendor/supplier information is stored in the CRM as well, even though the documentation doesn't mention it. Alternatively, it might be stored in a separate system not documented in the wiki.

However, the step asks us to search internal documentation and wiki files to understand how such operators are categorized and which system stores their contact email.

From our search:

1. The CRM system is the central repository for customer master data and contact information (including email).
2. We found no mention of a separate vendor registry or supplier management system in the wiki.
3. The term "vendor" appears in the wiki, but not in the context of a dedicated storage system.

Therefore, it's likely that external operators like EuroFlooring are treated as customers (if they are customers of Bellini) or possibly as suppliers. But without a dedicated supplier system, they might be stored in the CRM if they are considered a business relationship.

Alternatively, they might be stored in a separate system not documented in the wiki. However, the step requires us to use the available documentation.

Let's do one more search in the wiki for any mention of "supplier" or "vendor" in the context of a system.

```python
# Search all wiki files for the word "supplier" or "vendor" near the word "system" or "CRM"
print("=== SEARCHING FOR VENDOR/SUPPLIER AND SYSTEM IN WIKI ===")
all_files = list_wiki()
for file_path in all_files:
    content = load_wiki(file_path)
    if content:
        lines = content.split('\n')
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            line_lower = line.lower()
            if (('vendor' in line_lower or 'supplier' in line_lower) and 
                ('system' in line_lower or 'crm' in line_lower or 'storage' in line_lower or 'repository' in line_lower)):
                print(f"File: {file_path}, Line {i+1}: {line}")
```

Given the above, if we don't find any explicit reference to a vendor storage system, we might conclude that the CRM is used for storing contact information of external operators if they are considered customers. However, the step asks for the authoritative place for storing contact emails of such external operators.

Alternatively, we might not find any information in the wiki about where vendor contact emails are stored. In that case, we would set `found_in_wiki` to `False` and make a logical deduction based on the available systems.

But note: the step says "From the best-matching documents, extract which master system ... is indicated as the authoritative place".

We have not found any document that explicitly states where vendor contact emails are stored. The CRM system is only indicated for customers.

Therefore, we cannot definitively say from the wiki that there is an authoritative system for vendor contact emails. However, we can make an inference that if the external operator is a customer, then the CRM would be the system. But the step is about external logistics or flooring operators, which might be suppliers.

Let's run the additional search and then decide.

```python
# Run the additional search
all_files = list_wiki()
found = False
for file_path in all_files:
    content = load_wiki(file_path)
    if content:
        lines = content.split('\n')
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            line_lower = line.lower()
            if (('vendor' in line_lower or 'supplier' in line_lower) and 
                ('system' in line_lower or 'crm' in line_lower or 'storage' in line_lower or 'repository' in line_lower)):
                print(f"File: {file_path}, Line {i+1}: {line}")
                found = True

if not found:
    print("No direct link between vendor/supplier and a storage system found in wiki.")
```

Now, let's consider the fuzzy search result for "contact email" in the CRM file. The context was about who uses the CRM, but it doesn't specify vendors.

Given the lack of explicit documentation, we have to decide on the output.

The expected output requires:
- `vendor_contact_storage_system`: a string
- `found_in_wiki`: boolean

Since we did not find any wiki document that explicitly states the storage system for vendor contact emails, we should set `found_in_wiki` to `False`.

For `vendor_contact_storage_system`, we have to make a logical deduction. The only system we found that stores contact emails is the CRM (for customers). It is possible that vendors are also stored in the CRM, or there might be a separate system not documented in the wiki.

However, the step says to extract from the best-matching documents. We have no document that states where vendor contact emails are stored.

Alternatively, we might note that the CRM is the central repository for customer master data and contact information. If the external operator is treated as a customer (for example, if Bellini sells to them), then the CRM would be the system. But if they are a supplier, we don't know.

Given the ambiguity, we might set `vendor_contact_storage_system` to an empty string or to "CRM" as the only system we found that stores contact emails.

But note: the step says "which master system ... is indicated as the authoritative place". Since we don't have an indication, we should set it to an empty string.

However, let's check the fuzzy search results for "contact email" again. The best match was in the CRM file with ratio 0.85. The context was about who uses the CRM. But the CRM file does not mention vendors.

We have to decide. I think the most honest answer is that we didn't find a specific system for vendor contact emails in the wiki.

Let's output:
- `vendor_contact_storage_system`: "" (empty string)
- `found_in_wiki`: False

But wait, the step says "From the best-matching documents, extract which master system ... is indicated". If there is no indication, then we cannot extract it.

Alternatively, we might note that the CRM system is the only system mentioned for storing contact emails (for customers). So we could assume that if the external operator is a customer, then the CRM is the system. But the step does not specify if the operator is a customer or supplier.

Given the lack of information, I will output an empty string for the system and False for found_in_wiki.

However, let me do one more check: search for "logistics" in the CRM file to see if there is any mention.

```python
# Check CRM for logistics
crm_content = load_wiki("systems/crm.md")
if crm_content and 'logistics' in crm_content.lower():
    print("Found 'logistics' in CRM file")
else:
    print("No 'logistics' in CRM file")
```

Now, let's run this and then output.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[REASONING #6] 2025-12-10 00:02:55
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have searched the wiki and internal documentation. The step asks to find how external logistics or flooring operators like "EuroFlooring" are categorized and which system stores their contact email.

From our search:
- The CRM system is clearly documented as the central repository for **customer** master data and stores contact emails for customers.
- We found no documentation of a separate vendor/supplier registry or partner management system.
- The wiki does not explicitly state where vendor/supplier contact emails are stored, but from the CRM documentation, it is for customers.

However, the step asks for "external logistics or flooring operators" which might be considered as vendors/suppliers/partners, not necessarily customers. Since the documentation does not specify a separate system for vendors/suppliers, and given that the CRM is for customers, we cannot definitively say that vendor contact emails are stored in the CRM.

But note: the CRM documentation does not mention vendors or suppliers. The wiki does not have any other system documentation for vendor management.

Given the lack of explicit documentation, we might infer that if such external operators are treated as customers (e.g., if they are customers of Bellini), then their contact emails would be in the CRM. However, if they are purely vendors (i.e., Bellini pays them for services), then there is no documented system.

But the step expects an answer based on the documentation. Since we found no documentation about a vendor registry, and the only system that stores contact emails for external entities (customers) is the CRM, we can state that the CRM is the system for customer contact emails. However, the question is about "external logistics or flooring operators" which might be vendors, not customers.

We need to output:
{
  "vendor_contact_storage_system": string,
  "found_in_wiki": boolean
}

Since we did not find any explicit documentation about vendor contact storage, we have two options:
1. State that the CRM is the system for customer contact emails, and if vendors are treated as customers, then it would be CRM. But the documentation does not say vendors are stored in CRM.
2. State that no system is documented for vendor contact emails.

Given the requirement to base the answer on the documentation, and we found no documentation about vendor contact storage, we should set "found_in_wiki" to false and leave the system as empty or unknown.

However, note that the step says: "extract which master system ... is indicated as the authoritative place for storing contact emails of such external operators." We did not find any indication.

Let's re-check: did we find any mention of vendor or supplier in the context of a system? We found the word "vendor" in fuzzy results, but not in the context of a system for storing vendor contact emails.

We found that CRM is for customers. The business/markets_and_customers.md mentions "flooring" but in the context of customers (industrial flooring contractors). This might imply that flooring contractors are customers. However, the question is about "logistics floor operator" which might be a vendor that provides logistics floor services to Bellini, or a customer that buys coatings for their floors? Without explicit documentation, we cannot assume.

Given the instructions to only use the documentation, and we found no explicit system for vendor contact emails, we should output that we did not find this information in the wiki.

But wait: the step says "found_in_wiki": boolean. This means whether we found the information in the wiki. We did not find any documentation about where vendor contact emails are stored. So "found_in_wiki" should be false.

What to put for "vendor_contact_storage_system"? We can put an empty string or a note. The expected output is a string. Since we didn't find it, we can leave it empty.

Alternatively, we might note that the CRM is the only system that stores contact emails for external entities (customers), but it is not documented for vendors.

Given the lack of information, I will output:
{
  "vendor_contact_storage_system": "",
  "found_in_wiki": false
}

But let's double-check: is there any chance that the CRM is also used for vendors? We saw that the CRM is for customers. There is no mention of vendor or supplier in the CRM documentation.

We also searched for "vendor registry" and found no such file.

Therefore, the information is not found in the wiki.

However, note that the step says "Search internal documentation and wiki files", and we did that. We did not find any information about a system for vendor contact emails.

Thus, the answer is that we did not find this information in the wiki.

But wait: the step says "From the best-matching documents, extract which master system ... is indicated". Since we have no matching documents, we cannot extract.

Therefore, the output should reflect that we didn't find it.

I will output an empty string for the system and false for found_in_wiki.

However, let's consider: the step might be expecting that we found that CRM is for customers and that vendors might be stored elsewhere, but we didn't find that elsewhere. Since we are to base our answer on the documentation, and the documentation does not mention a vendor system, we cannot assume one.

Thus, the answer is:

<final_answer>
Based on a comprehensive search of the wiki and internal documentation, no explicit information was found regarding how external logistics or flooring operators (such as "EuroFlooring") are categorized or which master system stores their contact email information. The CRM system is documented as the central repository for customer master data and contact emails, but there is no mention of vendor, supplier, or partner contact email storage in any documented system.

We are asked to verify that we executed the step correctly and did not skip any actions or assume any facts.

We performed the following actions:
1. Listed all wiki files to understand the documentation structure.
2. Used fuzzy search (search_wiki_fuzzy) with a list of search terms including "EuroFlooring", "logistics floor operator", etc.
3. Used regex searches for patterns related to vendor categorization and contact storage.
4. Examined key system documentation files (CRM, markets_and_customers, knowledge_base, operations, etc.) by loading their content and searching for relevant terms.
5. Analyzed fuzzy search results for specific important terms.
6. Checked for any vendor/supplier management system files in the wiki.

We did not skip any actions. We used the available functions (who_am_i, list_wiki, load_wiki, search_wiki_fuzzy, search_wiki) to perform the search.

All facts in the JSON response are derived from function returns:
- We found that the CRM system is the central repository for customer master data and contact emails, but we did not find any documentation stating that it is used for vendor/supplier/partner contact emails.
- We did not find any dedicated vendor registry or supplier management system in the wiki.
- We did not find any references to "EuroFlooring" or similar logistics floor operators in the Netherlands.

Therefore, we set:
- "vendor_contact_storage_system": "" (empty string because no system was identified)
- "found_in_wiki": false (because we did not find any information about vendor contact storage in the wiki)

We did not change the state of any object (no update functions were called).

We are confident in our results.

Now, we repeat the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.
