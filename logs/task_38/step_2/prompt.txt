Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (SQL tables and fields) that should hold the contact email for an external logistics floor operator like EuroFlooring located in the Netherlands.
Approach: Using the SQL schema definitions provided, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL analysis of table and column names (for example, customer.name, customer.location, customer.primary_contact_email, employee.email) to determine which entity type (customer, employee, or other) most logically represents an external logistics floor operator. Prefer exact semantic matches (for example, external organizations with a location and primary_contact_email in the customer table). If multiple plausible implementations exist, list them all with reasoning. This step does not execute queries; it only maps the business concept "EuroFlooring logistics floor operator" to the most appropriate table(s) and field(s).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entity_type":{"type":"string"},"relevant_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"relevant_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"mapping_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["entity_type","relevant_tables","relevant_fields","mapping_confidence"]}
