I have successfully executed Step 2 as instructed. Through analysis of the available data structures and actual data retrieval, I verified that:

1. The Customer entity (corresponding to a "customer" SQL table) is the appropriate entity type for external logistics floor operators.
2. An exact match was found: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands with contact email "peter.devries@euroflooring.com" stored in the "primary_contact_email" field.
3. The Employee entity is for internal staff only (with internal email addresses like @bellini.internal) and is not suitable for external operators.
4. Other entity types (Project, TimeEntry) do not store contact email information for external parties.

All facts were verified through function returns: I retrieved sample customers and employees, examined their fields, and confirmed the existence of the EuroFlooring customer with its contact details. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "entity_type": "customer",
  "relevant_tables": ["customer"],
  "relevant_fields": ["primary_contact_email", "name", "location", "primary_contact_name", "account_manager", "deal_phase"],
  "mapping_confidence": 1.0
}
