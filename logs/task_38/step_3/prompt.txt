Step 3: Search the identified core table(s), most likely the CRM customer table, for a record corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands and compile a list of candidate matches.
Approach: Query the customer table (and any other identified relevant tables, if applicable) using a multi-stage search strategy. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'EuroFlooring'. If not found, relax the search by checking where a normalized lowercase string 'euroflooring' is contained in the name field or id field using substring checks (for example, 'euroflooring' in lower(name)). If still not found or to capture variants, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on names and brief descriptions using fuzzy_compare or similar, allowing for common typos and spacing variants (for example, 'Euro Flooring', 'Euro-Flooring', 'Eurofloring'). Additionally, filter or rank candidates by location fields matching the Netherlands context, such as location values like 'Amsterdam', or other Netherlands-related entries, again with fuzzy and partial matching if necessary. Return all candidate records with their ids, names, locations, and a numeric match score to indicate confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","location","match_score"]}}},"required":["customer_candidates"]}
