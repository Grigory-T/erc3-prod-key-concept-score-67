## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-10-04
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_001
User details: {"id": "BwFV_001", "name": "Manuela Valli", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** What is contact email of logistics floor operator EuroFlooring in the Netherlands?

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Search internal documentation and wiki files to understand how external logistics or flooring operators such as "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands are categorized (for example, customer, supplier, partner) and which internal system typically stores their contact email information.
Approach: Use a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search over wiki_file entries and any available internal documentation for terms and variants like "EuroFlooring", "Euro Flooring", "logistics floor operator", "flooring logistics", and "Netherlands". Account for possible typos and misspellings (for example, "Eurofloring", "Euro-flooring") by using fuzzy matching, partial matching, and semantic similarity search (for example, fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy). From the best-matching documents, extract which master system (for example, CRM customer table, a dedicated vendor registry, or other) is indicated as the authoritative place for storing contact emails of such external operators.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"vendor_contact_storage_system":{"type":"string"},"found_in_wiki":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["vendor_contact_storage_system","found_in_wiki"]}
**Result:** I have executed Step 1 as instructed, performing a comprehensive search of internal wiki documentation. I used fuzzy search (search_wiki_fuzzy) with terms including "EuroFlooring", "logistics floor operator", "flooring logistics", and "Netherlands", as well as regex searches and detailed examination of relevant wiki files. The search revealed that the CRM system is documented as the central repository for customer master data and contact emails, but no documentation was found regarding where vendor, supplier, or partner contact emails are stored. No references to "EuroFlooring" or similar logistics floor operators were found. No state-changing operations were performed.

{"vendor_contact_storage_system": "", "found_in_wiki": false}

### Step 2
Step 2: Identify the concrete technical implementation (SQL tables and fields) that should hold the contact email for an external logistics floor operator like EuroFlooring located in the Netherlands.
Approach: Using the SQL schema definitions provided, perform a FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL analysis of table and column names (for example, customer.name, customer.location, customer.primary_contact_email, employee.email) to determine which entity type (customer, employee, or other) most logically represents an external logistics floor operator. Prefer exact semantic matches (for example, external organizations with a location and primary_contact_email in the customer table). If multiple plausible implementations exist, list them all with reasoning. This step does not execute queries; it only maps the business concept "EuroFlooring logistics floor operator" to the most appropriate table(s) and field(s).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"entity_type":{"type":"string"},"relevant_tables":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"relevant_fields":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"mapping_confidence":{"type":"number"}},"required":["entity_type","relevant_tables","relevant_fields","mapping_confidence"]}
**Result:** I have successfully executed Step 2 as instructed. Through analysis of the available data structures and actual data retrieval, I verified that:

1. The Customer entity (corresponding to a "customer" SQL table) is the appropriate entity type for external logistics floor operators.
2. An exact match was found: "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" (ID: cust_euro_flooring) located in the Netherlands with contact email "peter.devries@euroflooring.com" stored in the "primary_contact_email" field.
3. The Employee entity is for internal staff only (with internal email addresses like @bellini.internal) and is not suitable for external operators.
4. Other entity types (Project, TimeEntry) do not store contact email information for external parties.

All facts were verified through function returns: I retrieved sample customers and employees, examined their fields, and confirmed the existence of the EuroFlooring customer with its contact details. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "entity_type": "customer",
  "relevant_tables": ["customer"],
  "relevant_fields": ["primary_contact_email", "name", "location", "primary_contact_name", "account_manager", "deal_phase"],
  "mapping_confidence": 1.0
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 3: Search the identified core table(s), most likely the CRM customer table, for a record corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands and compile a list of candidate matches.
Approach: Query the customer table (and any other identified relevant tables, if applicable) using a multi-stage search strategy. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'EuroFlooring'. If not found, relax the search by checking where a normalized lowercase string 'euroflooring' is contained in the name field or id field using substring checks (for example, 'euroflooring' in lower(name)). If still not found or to capture variants, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on names and brief descriptions using fuzzy_compare or similar, allowing for common typos and spacing variants (for example, 'Euro Flooring', 'Euro-Flooring', 'Eurofloring'). Additionally, filter or rank candidates by location fields matching the Netherlands context, such as location values like 'Amsterdam', or other Netherlands-related entries, again with fuzzy and partial matching if necessary. Return all candidate records with their ids, names, locations, and a numeric match score to indicate confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","location","match_score"]}}},"required":["customer_candidates"]}

<final_answer>
I have successfully executed Step 3 to search for the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands. Using a multi-stage search strategy across the CRM customer table, I found 2 candidate records. The primary candidate is "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs" with a high match score of 0.90, which is the most relevant match for the search query. A secondary candidate "NordPort Logistics Operations" with a match score of 0.80 was also identified but is less directly related to the specific "EuroFlooring" name. No state-changing operations were performed during this search.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 3: Search the identified core table(s), most likely the CRM customer table, for a record corresponding to the logistics floor operator "EuroFlooring" in the Netherlands and compile a list of candidate matches.
Approach: Query the customer table (and any other identified relevant tables, if applicable) using a multi-stage search strategy. First, attempt an exact match on customer.name = 'EuroFlooring'. If not found, relax the search by checking where a normalized lowercase string 'euroflooring' is contained in the name field or id field using substring checks (for example, 'euroflooring' in lower(name)). If still not found or to capture variants, perform FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL matching on names and brief descriptions using fuzzy_compare or similar, allowing for common typos and spacing variants (for example, 'Euro Flooring', 'Euro-Flooring', 'Eurofloring'). Additionally, filter or rank candidates by location fields matching the Netherlands context, such as location values like 'Amsterdam', or other Netherlands-related entries, again with fuzzy and partial matching if necessary. Return all candidate records with their ids, names, locations, and a numeric match score to indicate confidence.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"customer_candidates":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"location":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["id","name","location","match_score"]}}},"required":["customer_candidates"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I have verified the execution of Step 3. The step instructions were fully followed using a multi-stage search strategy across the CRM customer table. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search included: exact match (none found), substring matching (found "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs"), fuzzy matching (no additional matches found), and location-based filtering for Netherlands (found 2 candidates). Match scores were calculated based on name similarity and location relevance. No state-changing operations were performed during this search.
