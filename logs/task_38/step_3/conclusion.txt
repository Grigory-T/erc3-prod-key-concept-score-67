I have verified the execution of Step 3. The step instructions were fully followed using a multi-stage search strategy across the CRM customer table. All facts were verified from function returns without any assumptions or made-up data. The search included: exact match (none found), substring matching (found "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs"), fuzzy matching (no additional matches found), and location-based filtering for Netherlands (found 2 candidates). Match scores were calculated based on name similarity and location relevance. No state-changing operations were performed during this search.

{
  "customer_candidates": [
    {
      "id": "cust_euro_flooring",
      "name": "EuroFlooring Logistics Hubs",
      "location": "Netherlands",
      "match_score": 0.9
    },
    {
      "id": "cust_nordport_logistics",
      "name": "NordPort Logistics Operations",
      "location": "Netherlands",
      "match_score": 0.8
    }
  ]
}
