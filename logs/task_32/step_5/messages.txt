## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-20
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_049
User details: {"id": "BwFV_049", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Log 3 hours yesterday for Willemsen Puck on early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system. Billable, all other values - default. Draft status. Put a note to fill it properly later

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify employees X and Y in the employee table, where X is the target employee "Willemsen Puck" to log time for, and Y is the current authenticated user "Viola Messina". Resolve their employee_ids using exact match first, then case-insensitive, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search on name and email to account for possible typos or variations.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record for X using the provided name "Willemsen Puck". Start with an exact match on employee.name; if not found, perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (e.g., lower(trim(input)) in lower(trim(name))) and then apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical name similarity (e.g., approximate string distance, handling possible inversion of first and last names). For Y, use the current user context (id = "BwFV_049", name = "Viola Messina") to locate the employee row by id primarily, and if needed, confirm with name and email via the same fuzzy and semantic / logical methods. Do not access or return salary or confidential notes. The output should clearly indicate whether X was found, X's employee_id if found, and Y's employee_id and confirmation that Y is found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_x_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_x_found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_y_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_y_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_x_found","employee_y_id","employee_y_found"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 1 as per the instructions. For employee Y (current user "Viola Messina"), used exact match by employee_id "BwFV_049" and confirmed the employee exists with name "Viola Messina". For employee X (target "Willemsen Puck"), performed exact match on name (no result), then case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (no result), then applied fuzzy matching and semantic/logical name similarity by trying name order variations. Found the employee with name "Puck Willemsen" (employee_id "BwFV_025"), confirming that the name in the system uses first name then last name order. No salary or confidential notes were accessed. Both employees are confirmed to exist in the system.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.

{
  "employee_x_id": "BwFV_025",
  "employee_x_found": true,
  "employee_y_id": "BwFV_049",
  "employee_y_found": true
}

### Step 2
Step 2: Determine all relevant projects for employee X and the subset where employee Y is a Lead, as preparation for applying the mandatory time logging algorithm. Treat the phrase "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" as the project reference string (project_ref) and use it to filter projects. No customer reference (client_ref) is provided. Searching for projects must be fuzzy and semantic / logical to handle partial matches, ordering differences, and typos.
Approach: Using employee_x_id from Step 1, query the team_member table to retrieve all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_x_id, then join to project on project.id = team_member.project_id to build x_projects. This corresponds to all projects where X is a member. Then, apply filtering to obtain x_projects_filtered by checking whether the normalized project_ref string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in or closely matches (via fuzzy and semantic / logical similarity measures) either project.name or project.id; use exact and containment checks first, then fuzzy name matching if needed. In parallel, using employee_y_id from Step 1, query team_member where employee_id = employee_y_id AND role = 'Lead' and join to project to get y_projects_lead. Do not yet apply the decision logic; just collect full lists, handling possible misspellings in project names via fuzzy and semantic / logical matching. No customer filter is applied since client_ref is None, as required by the mandatory algorithm.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_ref":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"y_projects_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_ref","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","y_projects_lead"]}
**Result:** After verification, I confirmed that employee X (Willemsen Puck) is a member of exactly one project: "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" (ID: proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea). While the exact string matching and initial fuzzy comparison (36.7% ratio) didn't meet the threshold, semantic/logical analysis shows this project clearly matches the project reference "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" based on shared key terms: "eco-friendly", "topcoat", "concept", and "study". The project ID also contains "ferro_rail" which matches "FerroRail" in the reference.

Employee Y (Viola Messina) is the Lead on this same project.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations. The x_projects_filtered list now correctly includes the project based on semantic/logical matching as required by the step instructions.

{
  "project_ref": "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system",
  "x_projects": [
    {
      "id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
      "name": "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study",
      "customer_id": "cust_ferro_rail"
    }
  ],
  "x_projects_filtered": [
    {
      "id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
      "name": "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study",
      "customer_id": "cust_ferro_rail"
    }
  ],
  "y_projects_lead": [
    {
      "id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
      "name": "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study"
    }
  ]
}

### Step 3
Step 3: Apply the mandatory time logging algorithm decision logic using the data from Step 2 to determine the outcome (ok_not_found, none_clarification_needed, ok_answer, or denied_security) and, if applicable, identify the single target project where time could be logged for employee X, considering Y's Lead roles.
Approach: Implement the mandatory algorithm exactly: (1) Treat x_projects as all projects where X is a member (already computed). (2) Treat x_projects_filtered as already filtered by project_ref. (3) Since client_ref is None, skip customer-based filtering entirely. (4) Use y_projects_lead as all projects where Y is Lead. (5) Compute actionable_projects as the intersection of x_projects_filtered and y_projects_lead (matching by project.id). (6) Let n_filtered = length of x_projects_filtered and n_actionable = length of actionable_projects. If n_filtered == 0, set outcome = "ok_not_found" with no target_project. If n_filtered > 1, set outcome = "none_clarification_needed" regardless of n_actionable and do not auto-select a project; prepare to ask user for clarification later. If n_filtered == 1, let target_project be the sole project in x_projects_filtered; if target_project is also in actionable_projects, set outcome = "ok_answer" and keep target_project.id; otherwise, set outcome = "denied_security" without permission to proceed. Ensure comparisons handle potential minor name mismatches via identifiers (use project.id for equality).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"outcome":{"type":"string","enum":["ok_not_found","none_clarification_needed","ok_answer","denied_security"]},"n_filtered":{"type":"integer"},"n_actionable":{"type":"integer"},"target_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"actionable_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["outcome","n_filtered","n_actionable","target_project_id","actionable_project_ids"]}
**Result:** Step 3 completed successfully. The mandatory time logging algorithm was applied exactly as specified:

1. Used x_projects_filtered from Step 2 (already filtered by project_ref)
2. Used y_projects_lead from Step 2 (projects where Y is Lead)
3. Skipped customer-based filtering since client_ref is None
4. Computed actionable_projects as intersection of x_projects_filtered and y_projects_lead by project.id
5. Counted n_filtered = 1 and n_actionable = 1
6. Applied decision logic: since n_filtered == 1 and the target project is in actionable_projects, outcome = "ok_answer"

All data was derived from Step 2 results, which were verified through function calls. No state-changing functions were used in this step. The algorithm was implemented exactly as specified in the approach.

{
  "outcome": "ok_answer",
  "n_filtered": 1,
  "n_actionable": 1,
  "target_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "actionable_project_ids": ["proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea"]
}

### Step 4
Step 4: Explicitly verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user Y (who_am_i check) to ensure that logging time on behalf of employee X for the identified target project is allowed, in line with company rules that only project leads (or higher-authority roles) may create such entries.
Approach: Use the current authenticated user context (user.id = "BwFV_049", department = "R&D and Technical Service", location = "HQ – Italy") and the result from Step 3. If outcome from Step 3 is not "ok_answer" or target_project_id is null, mark has_permission = false and record the reason (e.g., project not found, multiple matches, or prior denied_security). If outcome is "ok_answer" and target_project_id is not null, perform a who_am_i style check by verifying that in the team_member table there is a row where project_id = target_project_id, employee_id = employee_y_id, and role = 'Lead'. Optionally, also consider any special system_roles if present, but do not invent new policies beyond the provided rules. Set has_permission to true only if this Lead condition is met; otherwise set has_permission to false. This step does not create or modify any time_entry; it only determines authorization to proceed.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"target_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","target_project_id","has_permission","permission_reason"]}
**Result:** Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` - verified user ID is "BwFV_049" (Viola Messina)
2. Checked that the outcome from Step 3 is "ok_answer" and target_project_id is not null
3. Retrieved the project details using `get_project()` for project ID "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea"
4. Examined the project team and verified that employee "BwFV_049" has role "Lead" in this project
5. Set has_permission = true based on this verification

All facts were verified through function returns - no assumptions were made. The project retrieval confirmed the existence of the project and the team member role was explicitly printed from the function return. No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_049",
  "target_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "has_permission": true,
  "permission_reason": "user is Lead of the target project"
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 5: If and only if Step 3 produced outcome = "ok_answer" and Step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, create a new draft time_entry for employee X for 3.00 hours on the date of yesterday (relative to 2025-05-20, so 2025-05-19), associated with the target project (and its customer if available), marked as billable, with default values for unspecified fields and a note to fill it properly later.
Approach: Check preconditions from previous steps: outcome must be "ok_answer", target_project_id must be non-null, and has_permission must be true. If any of these are not satisfied, do not create a time_entry and set created = false in the output. If preconditions are met, determine entry_date as 2025-05-19 (yesterday relative to 2025-05-20). Look up the project by target_project_id in the project table to retrieve its customer_id (if any) to set as time_entry.customer_id. Insert a new row into time_entry with: employee_id = employee_x_id; project_id = target_project_id; customer_id = project.customer_id (may be null); entry_date = '2025-05-19'; hours = 3.00; work_category = a descriptive string based directly and literally on the task such as "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system"; notes including the literal instruction "fill it properly later" (for example, "Placeholder entry for early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system – fill it properly later"); billable = true; status = 'draft'; logged_by = employee_y_id. Let the system auto-generate the time_entry.id according to its mechanism. Return whether creation succeeded and the new time_entry_id if available.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"attempted":{"type":"boolean"},"created":{"type":"boolean"},"time_entry_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"entry_date":{"type":["string","null"]},"hours":{"type":["number","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["attempted","created","time_entry_id"]}

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 5: If and only if Step 3 produced outcome = "ok_answer" and Step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, create a new draft time_entry for employee X for 3.00 hours on the date of yesterday (relative to 2025-05-20, so 2025-05-19), associated with the target project (and its customer if available), marked as billable, with default values for unspecified fields and a note to fill it properly later.
Approach: Check preconditions from previous steps: outcome must be "ok_answer", target_project_id must be non-null, and has_permission must be true. If any of these are not satisfied, do not create a time_entry and set created = false in the output. If preconditions are met, determine entry_date as 2025-05-19 (yesterday relative to 2025-05-20). Look up the project by target_project_id in the project table to retrieve its customer_id (if any) to set as time_entry.customer_id. Insert a new row into time_entry with: employee_id = employee_x_id; project_id = target_project_id; customer_id = project.customer_id (may be null); entry_date = '2025-05-19'; hours = 3.00; work_category = a descriptive string based directly and literally on the task such as "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system"; notes including the literal instruction "fill it properly later" (for example, "Placeholder entry for early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system – fill it properly later"); billable = true; status = 'draft'; logged_by = employee_y_id. Let the system auto-generate the time_entry.id according to its mechanism. Return whether creation succeeded and the new time_entry_id if available.

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

- Employee ID: BwFV_025 (Puck Willemsen)
- Project ID: proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea
- Customer ID: cust_ferro_rail (retrieved from the project)
- Date: 2025-05-19 (yesterday relative to 2025-05-20)
- Hours: 3.0
- Work category: "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" (taken directly from task description)
- Notes: "Placeholder entry for early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system – fill it properly later" (includes the required "fill it properly later" instruction)
- Billable: true
- Status: draft
- Logged by: BwFV_049 (current user Viola Messina)

The time entry was created successfully with a single call to log_time_entry (state-changing operation). All facts were verified through function returns: who_am_i(), get_employee(), get_project(), log_time_entry(), and get_time_entry(). No assumptions were made.
