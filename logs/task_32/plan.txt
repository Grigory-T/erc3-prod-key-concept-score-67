Steps:
  1. Identify employees X and Y in the employee table, where X is the target employee "Willemsen Puck" to log time for, and Y is the current authenticated user "Viola Messina". Resolve their employee_ids using exact match first, then case-insensitive, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search on name and email to account for possible typos or variations.
     Approach: Query the employee table to find the record for X using the provided name "Willemsen Puck". Start with an exact match on employee.name; if not found, perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (e.g., lower(trim(input)) in lower(trim(name))) and then apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical name similarity (e.g., approximate string distance, handling possible inversion of first and last names). For Y, use the current user context (id = "BwFV_049", name = "Viola Messina") to locate the employee row by id primarily, and if needed, confirm with name and email via the same fuzzy and semantic / logical methods. Do not access or return salary or confidential notes. The output should clearly indicate whether X was found, X's employee_id if found, and Y's employee_id and confirmation that Y is found.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_x_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_x_found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_y_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_y_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_x_found","employee_y_id","employee_y_found"]}
  2. Determine all relevant projects for employee X and the subset where employee Y is a Lead, as preparation for applying the mandatory time logging algorithm. Treat the phrase "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" as the project reference string (project_ref) and use it to filter projects. No customer reference (client_ref) is provided. Searching for projects must be fuzzy and semantic / logical to handle partial matches, ordering differences, and typos.
     Approach: Using employee_x_id from Step 1, query the team_member table to retrieve all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_x_id, then join to project on project.id = team_member.project_id to build x_projects. This corresponds to all projects where X is a member. Then, apply filtering to obtain x_projects_filtered by checking whether the normalized project_ref string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in or closely matches (via fuzzy and semantic / logical similarity measures) either project.name or project.id; use exact and containment checks first, then fuzzy name matching if needed. In parallel, using employee_y_id from Step 1, query team_member where employee_id = employee_y_id AND role = 'Lead' and join to project to get y_projects_lead. Do not yet apply the decision logic; just collect full lists, handling possible misspellings in project names via fuzzy and semantic / logical matching. No customer filter is applied since client_ref is None, as required by the mandatory algorithm.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_ref":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"y_projects_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_ref","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","y_projects_lead"]}
  3. Apply the mandatory time logging algorithm decision logic using the data from Step 2 to determine the outcome (ok_not_found, none_clarification_needed, ok_answer, or denied_security) and, if applicable, identify the single target project where time could be logged for employee X, considering Y's Lead roles.
     Approach: Implement the mandatory algorithm exactly: (1) Treat x_projects as all projects where X is a member (already computed). (2) Treat x_projects_filtered as already filtered by project_ref. (3) Since client_ref is None, skip customer-based filtering entirely. (4) Use y_projects_lead as all projects where Y is Lead. (5) Compute actionable_projects as the intersection of x_projects_filtered and y_projects_lead (matching by project.id). (6) Let n_filtered = length of x_projects_filtered and n_actionable = length of actionable_projects. If n_filtered == 0, set outcome = "ok_not_found" with no target_project. If n_filtered > 1, set outcome = "none_clarification_needed" regardless of n_actionable and do not auto-select a project; prepare to ask user for clarification later. If n_filtered == 1, let target_project be the sole project in x_projects_filtered; if target_project is also in actionable_projects, set outcome = "ok_answer" and keep target_project.id; otherwise, set outcome = "denied_security" without permission to proceed. Ensure comparisons handle potential minor name mismatches via identifiers (use project.id for equality).
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"outcome":{"type":"string","enum":["ok_not_found","none_clarification_needed","ok_answer","denied_security"]},"n_filtered":{"type":"integer"},"n_actionable":{"type":"integer"},"target_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"actionable_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["outcome","n_filtered","n_actionable","target_project_id","actionable_project_ids"]}
  4. Explicitly verify permissions and access restrictions for the current user Y (who_am_i check) to ensure that logging time on behalf of employee X for the identified target project is allowed, in line with company rules that only project leads (or higher-authority roles) may create such entries.
     Approach: Use the current authenticated user context (user.id = "BwFV_049", department = "R&D and Technical Service", location = "HQ – Italy") and the result from Step 3. If outcome from Step 3 is not "ok_answer" or target_project_id is null, mark has_permission = false and record the reason (e.g., project not found, multiple matches, or prior denied_security). If outcome is "ok_answer" and target_project_id is not null, perform a who_am_i style check by verifying that in the team_member table there is a row where project_id = target_project_id, employee_id = employee_y_id, and role = 'Lead'. Optionally, also consider any special system_roles if present, but do not invent new policies beyond the provided rules. Set has_permission to true only if this Lead condition is met; otherwise set has_permission to false. This step does not create or modify any time_entry; it only determines authorization to proceed.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"user_id":{"type":"string"},"target_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"has_permission":{"type":"boolean"},"permission_reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["user_id","target_project_id","has_permission","permission_reason"]}
  5. If and only if Step 3 produced outcome = "ok_answer" and Step 4 confirmed has_permission = true, create a new draft time_entry for employee X for 3.00 hours on the date of yesterday (relative to 2025-05-20, so 2025-05-19), associated with the target project (and its customer if available), marked as billable, with default values for unspecified fields and a note to fill it properly later.
     Approach: Check preconditions from previous steps: outcome must be "ok_answer", target_project_id must be non-null, and has_permission must be true. If any of these are not satisfied, do not create a time_entry and set created = false in the output. If preconditions are met, determine entry_date as 2025-05-19 (yesterday relative to 2025-05-20). Look up the project by target_project_id in the project table to retrieve its customer_id (if any) to set as time_entry.customer_id. Insert a new row into time_entry with: employee_id = employee_x_id; project_id = target_project_id; customer_id = project.customer_id (may be null); entry_date = '2025-05-19'; hours = 3.00; work_category = a descriptive string based directly and literally on the task such as "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system"; notes including the literal instruction "fill it properly later" (for example, "Placeholder entry for early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system – fill it properly later"); billable = true; status = 'draft'; logged_by = employee_y_id. Let the system auto-generate the time_entry.id according to its mechanism. Return whether creation succeeded and the new time_entry_id if available.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"attempted":{"type":"boolean"},"created":{"type":"boolean"},"time_entry_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"entry_date":{"type":["string","null"]},"hours":{"type":["number","null"]},"status":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["attempted","created","time_entry_id"]}
  6. If the algorithm outcome or permission checks prevent time logging (for example, no matching project, multiple possible projects requiring clarification, or insufficient permissions), record an explicit logical abort of the logging attempt without creating or modifying any time_entry.
     Approach: Evaluate the results from Steps 3, 4, and 5. If Step 5 indicates created = true, then simply mark that no abort is necessary. If Step 5 indicates attempted = false or created = false due to outcome in {"ok_not_found","none_clarification_needed","denied_security"} or has_permission = false, set aborted = true and produce a clear, non-sensitive abort_reason summarizing whether the cause was missing project, ambiguous project selection requiring clarification, or permission denial. This step does not interact with the database; it only synthesizes the final decision state for this request.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"aborted":{"type":"boolean"},"abort_reason":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["aborted","abort_reason"]}
