Successfully executed Step 1 as per the instructions. For employee Y (current user "Viola Messina"), used exact match by employee_id "BwFV_049" and confirmed the employee exists with name "Viola Messina". For employee X (target "Willemsen Puck"), performed exact match on name (no result), then case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (no result), then applied fuzzy matching and semantic/logical name similarity by trying name order variations. Found the employee with name "Puck Willemsen" (employee_id "BwFV_025"), confirming that the name in the system uses first name then last name order. No salary or confidential notes were accessed. Both employees are confirmed to exist in the system.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.
