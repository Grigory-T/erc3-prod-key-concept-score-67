Step 1: Identify employees X and Y in the employee table, where X is the target employee "Willemsen Puck" to log time for, and Y is the current authenticated user "Viola Messina". Resolve their employee_ids using exact match first, then case-insensitive, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search on name and email to account for possible typos or variations.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record for X using the provided name "Willemsen Puck". Start with an exact match on employee.name; if not found, perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (e.g., lower(trim(input)) in lower(trim(name))) and then apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical name similarity (e.g., approximate string distance, handling possible inversion of first and last names). For Y, use the current user context (id = "BwFV_049", name = "Viola Messina") to locate the employee row by id primarily, and if needed, confirm with name and email via the same fuzzy and semantic / logical methods. Do not access or return salary or confidential notes. The output should clearly indicate whether X was found, X's employee_id if found, and Y's employee_id and confirmation that Y is found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_x_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_x_found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_y_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_y_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_x_found","employee_y_id","employee_y_found"]}
