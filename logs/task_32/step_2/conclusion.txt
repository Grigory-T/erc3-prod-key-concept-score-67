After verification, I confirmed that employee X (Willemsen Puck) is a member of exactly one project: "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" (ID: proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea). While the exact string matching and initial fuzzy comparison (36.7% ratio) didn't meet the threshold, semantic/logical analysis shows this project clearly matches the project reference "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" based on shared key terms: "eco-friendly", "topcoat", "concept", and "study". The project ID also contains "ferro_rail" which matches "FerroRail" in the reference.

Employee Y (Viola Messina) is the Lead on this same project.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations. The x_projects_filtered list now correctly includes the project based on semantic/logical matching as required by the step instructions.
