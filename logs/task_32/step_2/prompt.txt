Step 2: Determine all relevant projects for employee X and the subset where employee Y is a Lead, as preparation for applying the mandatory time logging algorithm. Treat the phrase "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" as the project reference string (project_ref) and use it to filter projects. No customer reference (client_ref) is provided. Searching for projects must be fuzzy and semantic / logical to handle partial matches, ordering differences, and typos.
Approach: Using employee_x_id from Step 1, query the team_member table to retrieve all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_x_id, then join to project on project.id = team_member.project_id to build x_projects. This corresponds to all projects where X is a member. Then, apply filtering to obtain x_projects_filtered by checking whether the normalized project_ref string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in or closely matches (via fuzzy and semantic / logical similarity measures) either project.name or project.id; use exact and containment checks first, then fuzzy name matching if needed. In parallel, using employee_y_id from Step 1, query team_member where employee_id = employee_y_id AND role = 'Lead' and join to project to get y_projects_lead. Do not yet apply the decision logic; just collect full lists, handling possible misspellings in project names via fuzzy and semantic / logical matching. No customer filter is applied since client_ref is None, as required by the mandatory algorithm.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_ref":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"y_projects_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_ref","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","y_projects_lead"]}
