## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-20
Current actor: Authenticated user BwFV_049
User details: {"id": "BwFV_049", "name": "Viola Messina", "department": "R&D and Technical Service", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Log 3 hours yesterday for Willemsen Puck on early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system. Billable, all other values - default. Draft status. Put a note to fill it properly later

## Previous Steps of Task Plan Completed

### Step 1
Step 1: Identify employees X and Y in the employee table, where X is the target employee "Willemsen Puck" to log time for, and Y is the current authenticated user "Viola Messina". Resolve their employee_ids using exact match first, then case-insensitive, partial, fuzzy, and semantic / logical search on name and email to account for possible typos or variations.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record for X using the provided name "Willemsen Puck". Start with an exact match on employee.name; if not found, perform case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (e.g., lower(trim(input)) in lower(trim(name))) and then apply fuzzy matching and semantic / logical name similarity (e.g., approximate string distance, handling possible inversion of first and last names). For Y, use the current user context (id = "BwFV_049", name = "Viola Messina") to locate the employee row by id primarily, and if needed, confirm with name and email via the same fuzzy and semantic / logical methods. Do not access or return salary or confidential notes. The output should clearly indicate whether X was found, X's employee_id if found, and Y's employee_id and confirmation that Y is found.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_x_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_x_found":{"type":"boolean"},"employee_y_id":{"type":"string"},"employee_y_found":{"type":"boolean"}},"required":["employee_x_found","employee_y_id","employee_y_found"]}
**Result:** Successfully executed Step 1 as per the instructions. For employee Y (current user "Viola Messina"), used exact match by employee_id "BwFV_049" and confirmed the employee exists with name "Viola Messina". For employee X (target "Willemsen Puck"), performed exact match on name (no result), then case-insensitive and whitespace-normalized containment checks (no result), then applied fuzzy matching and semantic/logical name similarity by trying name order variations. Found the employee with name "Puck Willemsen" (employee_id "BwFV_025"), confirming that the name in the system uses first name then last name order. No salary or confidential notes were accessed. Both employees are confirmed to exist in the system.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.

{
  "employee_x_id": "BwFV_025",
  "employee_x_found": true,
  "employee_y_id": "BwFV_049",
  "employee_y_found": true
}

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 2: Determine all relevant projects for employee X and the subset where employee Y is a Lead, as preparation for applying the mandatory time logging algorithm. Treat the phrase "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" as the project reference string (project_ref) and use it to filter projects. No customer reference (client_ref) is provided. Searching for projects must be fuzzy and semantic / logical to handle partial matches, ordering differences, and typos.
Approach: Using employee_x_id from Step 1, query the team_member table to retrieve all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_x_id, then join to project on project.id = team_member.project_id to build x_projects. This corresponds to all projects where X is a member. Then, apply filtering to obtain x_projects_filtered by checking whether the normalized project_ref string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in or closely matches (via fuzzy and semantic / logical similarity measures) either project.name or project.id; use exact and containment checks first, then fuzzy name matching if needed. In parallel, using employee_y_id from Step 1, query team_member where employee_id = employee_y_id AND role = 'Lead' and join to project to get y_projects_lead. Do not yet apply the decision logic; just collect full lists, handling possible misspellings in project names via fuzzy and semantic / logical matching. No customer filter is applied since client_ref is None, as required by the mandatory algorithm.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_ref":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"y_projects_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_ref","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","y_projects_lead"]}

I'll execute the current step by finding relevant projects for both employees and applying the required filtering.

Successfully executed Step 2. Found that employee X (Willemsen Puck) is a member of exactly 1 project, which is semantically related to the project reference "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system". Employee Y (Viola Messina) is the Lead on that same project.

The initial fuzzy matching with a 60% threshold didn't match the project name due to the difference in wording between the project reference string and the actual project name. However, semantic/logical analysis shows they refer to the same project based on shared keywords: "eco-friendly", "topcoat", "concept", and "study". Therefore, the filtered list includes this project.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 2: Determine all relevant projects for employee X and the subset where employee Y is a Lead, as preparation for applying the mandatory time logging algorithm. Treat the phrase "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" as the project reference string (project_ref) and use it to filter projects. No customer reference (client_ref) is provided. Searching for projects must be fuzzy and semantic / logical to handle partial matches, ordering differences, and typos.
Approach: Using employee_x_id from Step 1, query the team_member table to retrieve all rows where team_member.employee_id = employee_x_id, then join to project on project.id = team_member.project_id to build x_projects. This corresponds to all projects where X is a member. Then, apply filtering to obtain x_projects_filtered by checking whether the normalized project_ref string (lowercased, trimmed) is contained in or closely matches (via fuzzy and semantic / logical similarity measures) either project.name or project.id; use exact and containment checks first, then fuzzy name matching if needed. In parallel, using employee_y_id from Step 1, query team_member where employee_id = employee_y_id AND role = 'Lead' and join to project to get y_projects_lead. Do not yet apply the decision logic; just collect full lists, handling possible misspellings in project names via fuzzy and semantic / logical matching. No customer filter is applied since client_ref is None, as required by the mandatory algorithm.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"project_ref":{"type":"string"},"x_projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"x_projects_filtered":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name"]}},"y_projects_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"}},"required":["id","name"]}}},"required":["project_ref","x_projects","x_projects_filtered","y_projects_lead"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

I need to verify my execution and correct an issue. The output shows that `x_projects_filtered` had 0 items, but in my JSON response I included the project anyway. This is inconsistent with the actual function returns. Let me re-examine the filtering logic and apply proper fuzzy/semantic matching.

```python
# Re-examine the project filtering with better fuzzy/semantic matching
print("=== VERIFICATION: Re-examining project filtering ===")

# Get the project again to have full details
project_full = get_project("proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea")
print(f"Project full details: {project_full.name}")

# Test different fuzzy matching approaches
project_ref = "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system"
print(f"\nProject reference: '{project_ref}'")

# Break down the reference into key terms
key_terms = ["early", "concept", "study", "eco-friendly", "ferrorail", "topcoat", "system"]
print(f"Key terms: {key_terms}")

# Check for term presence in project name
project_name_lower = project_full.name.lower()
print(f"\nProject name (lower): '{project_name_lower}'")

matches = []
for term in key_terms:
    if term in project_name_lower:
        matches.append(term)
        print(f"  Term '{term}' found in project name")

print(f"\nTotal matching terms: {len(matches)} out of {len(key_terms)}")

# Try fuzzy comparison with the actual project name
print("\n--- Fuzzy comparison with project name ---")
fuzzy_result = fuzzy_compare([project_ref], [project_full.name], top_n=5)
print(f"Fuzzy comparison result: {fuzzy_result}")

# Try fuzzy comparison with key terms vs project name
print("\n--- Fuzzy comparison of key terms vs project name ---")
for term in key_terms:
    term_result = fuzzy_compare([term], [project_full.name], top_n=3)
    print(f"Term '{term}': best ratio {term_result[0]['ratio']:.1f}%")

# Check if we should include this project based on semantic/logical matching
# The project clearly relates to the reference based on shared concepts
print("\n--- Semantic/logical analysis ---")
print("Project reference mentions: early concept study for eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system")
print(f"Project is: {project_full.name}")
print("Shared concepts: concept study, eco-friendly, topcoat")
print("This appears to be the same project despite wording differences.")

# Based on semantic/logical matching, this project should be included
# Let me also check the project ID for matching
print(f"\nProject ID: {project_full.id}")
if 'ferro' in project_full.id.lower() and 'rail' in project_full.id.lower():
    print("Project ID contains 'ferro' and 'rail' - matches FerroRail reference")

# The step requires "fuzzy and semantic / logical" matching
# Given the clear semantic relationship, this project should be in x_projects_filtered
print("\nConclusion: The project should be included in x_projects_filtered due to semantic/logical match.")

<final_answer>
After verification, I confirmed that employee X (Willemsen Puck) is a member of exactly one project: "Eco-friendly topcoat concept study" (ID: proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea). While the exact string matching and initial fuzzy comparison (36.7% ratio) didn't meet the threshold, semantic/logical analysis shows this project clearly matches the project reference "early concept study for an eco-friendly FerroRail topcoat system" based on shared key terms: "eco-friendly", "topcoat", "concept", and "study". The project ID also contains "ferro_rail" which matches "FerroRail" in the reference.

Employee Y (Viola Messina) is the Lead on this same project.

No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations. The x_projects_filtered list now correctly includes the project based on semantic/logical matching as required by the step instructions.
