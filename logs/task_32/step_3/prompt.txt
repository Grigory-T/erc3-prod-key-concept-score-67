Step 3: Apply the mandatory time logging algorithm decision logic using the data from Step 2 to determine the outcome (ok_not_found, none_clarification_needed, ok_answer, or denied_security) and, if applicable, identify the single target project where time could be logged for employee X, considering Y's Lead roles.
Approach: Implement the mandatory algorithm exactly: (1) Treat x_projects as all projects where X is a member (already computed). (2) Treat x_projects_filtered as already filtered by project_ref. (3) Since client_ref is None, skip customer-based filtering entirely. (4) Use y_projects_lead as all projects where Y is Lead. (5) Compute actionable_projects as the intersection of x_projects_filtered and y_projects_lead (matching by project.id). (6) Let n_filtered = length of x_projects_filtered and n_actionable = length of actionable_projects. If n_filtered == 0, set outcome = "ok_not_found" with no target_project. If n_filtered > 1, set outcome = "none_clarification_needed" regardless of n_actionable and do not auto-select a project; prepare to ask user for clarification later. If n_filtered == 1, let target_project be the sole project in x_projects_filtered; if target_project is also in actionable_projects, set outcome = "ok_answer" and keep target_project.id; otherwise, set outcome = "denied_security" without permission to proceed. Ensure comparisons handle potential minor name mismatches via identifiers (use project.id for equality).
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"outcome":{"type":"string","enum":["ok_not_found","none_clarification_needed","ok_answer","denied_security"]},"n_filtered":{"type":"integer"},"n_actionable":{"type":"integer"},"target_project_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"actionable_project_ids":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}}},"required":["outcome","n_filtered","n_actionable","target_project_id","actionable_project_ids"]}
