Step 3 completed successfully. The mandatory time logging algorithm was applied exactly as specified:

1. Used x_projects_filtered from Step 2 (already filtered by project_ref)
2. Used y_projects_lead from Step 2 (projects where Y is Lead)
3. Skipped customer-based filtering since client_ref is None
4. Computed actionable_projects as intersection of x_projects_filtered and y_projects_lead by project.id
5. Counted n_filtered = 1 and n_actionable = 1
6. Applied decision logic: since n_filtered == 1 and the target project is in actionable_projects, outcome = "ok_answer"

All data was derived from Step 2 results, which were verified through function calls. No state-changing functions were used in this step. The algorithm was implemented exactly as specified in the approach.

  "outcome": "ok_answer",

  "n_actionable": 1,
  "target_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
