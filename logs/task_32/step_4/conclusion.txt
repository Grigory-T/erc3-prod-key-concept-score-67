Step 4 completed successfully. I executed the step instruction exactly as specified:

1. Retrieved current user context using `who_am_i()` - verified user ID is "BwFV_049" (Viola Messina)
2. Checked that the outcome from Step 3 is "ok_answer" and target_project_id is not null
3. Retrieved the project details using `get_project()` for project ID "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea"
4. Examined the project team and verified that employee "BwFV_049" has role "Lead" in this project
5. Set has_permission = true based on this verification

All facts were verified through function returns - no assumptions were made. The project retrieval confirmed the existence of the project and the team member role was explicitly printed from the function return. No state-changing functions were used in this step, only read operations.

{
  "user_id": "BwFV_049",
  "target_project_id": "proj_ferro_rail_ecofriendly_topcoat_idea",
  "has_permission": true,
  "permission_reason": "user is Lead of the target project"
}
