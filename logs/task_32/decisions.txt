DECISION AFTER STEP 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:43:13
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
Step 1 was executed correctly and yielded the expected result: both target (Puck Willemsen) and operator (Viola Messina) were found, employee ids resolved unambiguously, and no extra or missing information was introduced. There are no discrepancies, errors, or unexpected results. According to the task plan, the next step is to continue to Step 2 (project search/fuzzy matching). No company rules are violated, and no replanning or abort is necessary at this point.

DECISION AFTER STEP 2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:48:57
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps so far have produced expected, correct results. Employee X and Y have been positively identified, and the relevant project has been unambiguously identified via semantic/logical matching. There is exactly one filtered project and the current user is Lead on that project, with no ambiguities or permission issues raised so far. The next step requires applying the mandatory time logging algorithm, which will almost certainly yield 'ok_answer' with one actionable project. There is no indication from the results or plan steps so far that replanning or abort is necessary; execution is proceeding along the expected path.

DECISION AFTER STEP 3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:50:10
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All completed steps have produced expected, correct, and unambiguous results precisely according to the plan. There are no errors or inconsistencies. The next step (Step 4) requires a straightforward permissions check using already validated data. Since the plan is fully aligned with both results and company policy, the next planned step should be executed.

DECISION AFTER STEP 4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:51:18
Decision: continue

Reasoning:
All steps up to Step 4 have returned correct and expected results matching the original plan. Preconditions for Step 5 are fully met: the project was unambiguously found, the user has explicit Lead permissions, and there is no indication of abnormality or missing data. No rule or result requires a replan or abort. The process should continue with the actual creation of the time entry in Step 5 as originally laid out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DECISION AFTER STEP 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Time: 2025-12-09 20:53:07
Decision: final_answer

Reasoning:
The process precisely followed all required steps. Each previous step produced the expected and correct results. In Step 5, the time entry was created as intended with all plan requirements (draft, correct date, employee, project, note, etc.). Step 6 only needs to record that no abort is necessary if creation succeeded. The plan is complete: the original task has been successfully executed, compliance with company policy is verified, and no further replanning or continuation is needed.
