Step 2: Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Laura Pellegrini, id "ayEi_001") to ensure she is allowed to view project leadership information for the identified employee.
Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent authorization and role inspection function to retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry or access control system. Confirm that the bound identity matches user id "ayEi_001" and that no privilege escalation is present. Based on the retrieved roles (for example, executive leadership or similar high-level roles), determine whether the user is permitted to read project and team_member information for other employees. Since the requested operation is read-only access to project and team membership data (not salaries or HR notes), evaluate policies to decide if such access is allowed for this user. If access is denied, mark the operation as not permitted and note the reason so the overall task can be aborted. This step does not perform any project queries yet; it only assesses permissions once the employee_id from Step 1 is known.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_roles","can_view_projects","reason"]}
