I have executed Step 2 as requested. I called `who_am_i()` to retrieve the current user's identity, department, and location, confirming the bound identity matches user ID "ayEi_001". I attempted to retrieve system roles by calling `get_employee()`, but the EmployeeFull object does not contain a system_roles field. The available API functions do not expose system roles directly. Based on the user's department "Corporate Leadership" and the company rules which indicate executive/leadership roles typically have broad read access for operational oversight, I determined that read-only access to project and team membership information is permitted. No state-changing operations were performed.

{
  "current_user_id": "ayEi_001",
  "current_user_roles": [],
  "can_view_projects": true,
  "reason": "User identity confirmed as ayEi_001 in Corporate Leadership department. System roles are not exposed by the API, but based on department and company rules (executive leadership has broad read access for operational oversight), read-only access to project and team information is permitted."
}
