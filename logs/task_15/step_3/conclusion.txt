I have successfully completed Step 3. Using the employee_id "ayEi_033" confirmed in Step 1, I searched for all projects where this employee is a team member. I found 2 projects total. By examining the team composition of each project, I confirmed that employee ayEi_033 has the role 'Lead' in both projects. The projects are:
1. proj_novaauto_chassis_line (Chassis line corrosion package)
2. proj_danubesteel_bridge_steel_system (Bridge steel anti-corrosion package)

No state-changing operations were performed - this was a read-only query to retrieve project leadership information.

{
  "employee_id": "ayEi_033",
  "project_ids_lead": ["proj_novaauto_chassis_line", "proj_danubesteel_bridge_steel_system"],
  "project_count": 2
}
