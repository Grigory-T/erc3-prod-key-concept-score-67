Steps:
  1. Identify the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin" in the employee table, resolving the correct employee_id to use for subsequent queries.
     Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person referred to as "Zimmermann Benjamin". First perform an exact match on the name field (full string "Zimmermann Benjamin"). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (normalize by lowercasing and trimming whitespace) where the input string is contained in the name field. If still not found or if multiple results appear, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL name matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for possible misspellings, inverted name order ("Benjamin Zimmermann"), middle names, or diacritics. If multiple candidates remain after fuzzy matching, select the best match by highest confidence and keep the list of alternatives for reference. Searching must also account for potential typos in both given name and surname. Do not proceed to later steps until either a single best-match employee_id is determined or it is concluded that no plausible employee exists.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name_input":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name_input","matched_employee_name","found","candidate_employees"]}
  2. Check permissions and access restrictions for the current user (Laura Pellegrini, id "ayEi_001") to ensure she is allowed to view project leadership information for the identified employee.
     Approach: Call a who_am_i() or equivalent authorization and role inspection function to retrieve the current user's identity, department, location, and system_roles from the EmployeeRegistry or access control system. Confirm that the bound identity matches user id "ayEi_001" and that no privilege escalation is present. Based on the retrieved roles (for example, executive leadership or similar high-level roles), determine whether the user is permitted to read project and team_member information for other employees. Since the requested operation is read-only access to project and team membership data (not salaries or HR notes), evaluate policies to decide if such access is allowed for this user. If access is denied, mark the operation as not permitted and note the reason so the overall task can be aborted. This step does not perform any project queries yet; it only assesses permissions once the employee_id from Step 1 is known.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"current_user_id":{"type":"string"},"current_user_roles":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"can_view_projects":{"type":"boolean"},"reason":{"type":"string"}},"required":["current_user_id","current_user_roles","can_view_projects","reason"]}
  3. Retrieve all team_member records where the identified employee is listed as a team member with role 'Lead', to determine which projects they lead.
     Approach: Using the employee_id confirmed in Step 1 and assuming Step 2 indicates that the current user can view this information, query the team_member table for all rows where employee_id equals that value and role equals 'Lead'. Use exact matching on employee_id and role since these are structured fields. If for any reason employee_id is unavailable or not found, do not attempt this query and instead prepare an empty result. For robustness, if there is any uncertainty about the stored role string (for example, badly capitalized entries), a secondary FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on the role field (e.g., case-insensitive comparison or fuzzy match around 'Lead' versus 'lead') can be used, but exact match results should be preferred. Collect the distinct project_id values from these records as the set of projects that the employee leads, and compute their count.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"project_ids_lead":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"string"}},"project_count":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["employee_id","project_ids_lead","project_count"]}
  4. Fetch project details for all projects where the employee is a Lead, to answer which projects Zimmermann Benjamin leads.
     Approach: Using the list of project_ids obtained in Step 3, query the project table for each of these identifiers. Use exact matching on the id field. If needed (for example, in case of inconsistent identifiers), allow a secondary FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on project id or name, but always prefer exact id matches when available. For each matching project, retrieve at minimum the id, name, status, and customer_id, and optionally other non-sensitive fields such as description if useful. Assemble these records into a list that represents all projects led by the identified employee. If the list of project_ids is empty, return an empty array to indicate that the employee does not lead any projects.
     Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","status","customer_id"]}},"total_projects":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_projects"]}
