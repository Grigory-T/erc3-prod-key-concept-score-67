## Company rules (you should strictly follow them)
**IF NESSESARY TAKE ACTIONS TO COMPLY WITH THE COMPANY RULES BELOW**

## Authenticated User Rules:
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND access_via == 'chatbot' THEN
  ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES = {name, email, location, department, basic_role, context_relevant_subset_of(skills, wills)};
  RETURN only ALLOW_FIELDS_FOR_ALL_EMPLOYEES UNLESS rule_for_confidential_fields_applies;
- IF request.resource == EmployeeProfile AND requested_fields INTERSECT {salary, hr_notes} != Ø THEN
  REQUIRE (user.system_roles CONTAINS 'HRAdmin') OR is_manager_of(user, target_employee) == true;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security' AND DO NOT reveal_presence_of_values(salary, hr_notes);
- IF action IN {UpdateLocation, UpdateDepartment, UpdateSkills, UpdateWills, UpdateEmployeeNotes} THEN
  REQUIRE backend_permission_check(user, target_employee, action) == ALLOW;
  IF DENY THEN RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Typical policy: self can edit own skills/wills; HR/authorized managers may edit broader fields.
- IF action IN {CreateCustomer, UpdateCustomer, ChangeDealPhase} ON CRM THEN
  REQUIRE user.system_roles INTERSECT {'SalesUser','CustomerServiceUser','SalesManager','CRMAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
  // Other roles may read CRM where allowed but must not mutate core customer records.
- IF action IN {CreateProject, UpdateProjectCoreFields(Status, Description, LinkedCustomer, ProjectManager), ModifyTeamWorkload} THEN
  REQUIRE user.id == project.project_manager OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'DepartmentLeader','ProjectAdmin','ITAdmin'} != Ø;
  ELSE RETURN Outcome='denied_security';
- IF action == ModifyTimeEntry THEN
  REQUIRE target_entry.employee_id == user.id OR user.system_roles CONTAINS 'TimesheetAdmin';
  REQUIRE target_entry.status == 'draft';
  IF target_entry.status IN {'submitted','approved','invoiced','voided'} THEN DENY and RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // corrections must use dedicated correction workflow outside normal edit
- IF user.is_project_lead_for(project_id) AND action == CreateOrEditTimeEntryForOtherEmployee THEN
  ALLOW ONLY IF new_or_updated_entry.status == 'draft';
  DENY IF action_attempts_status_change_to IN {'submitted','approved'} FOR other_employee;
- IF action IN {AddSkill, UpdateSkillLevel, RemoveSkill, AddWill, UpdateWillLevel, RemoveWill} ON EmployeeProfile THEN
  REQUIRE (user.id == target_employee.id) OR user.system_roles INTERSECT {'HRAdmin','Manager'} != Ø;
  MAINTAIN representation AS alphabetically_sorted(SkillLevel.name);
- IF query_type IN {SearchBySkill, ListReportsTo, FindExpertsByLocation} THEN
  ALLOW returning lists of employees WITH FIELDS {name, location, department, relevant_skills/wills} ONLY;
  NEVER include {salary, hr_notes, private_identifiers} in such list responses.

## General Rules:
- FOR EACH session/chatbot_request: REQUIRE user.employee_id != null; BIND user.department, user.location, user.system_roles FROM EmployeeRegistry; ALL authorization_decisions MUST use this bound identity (NO privilege escalation or role spoofing by the agent).
- IF target_system == Wiki AND content_to_write CONTAINS sensitive_personal_data({individual_salaries, confidential_HR_notes}) THEN
  DENY write_request; RETURN Outcome='denied_security'; // Enforce: 'Avoid storing sensitive information (e.g. individual salaries) in the wiki.'
- ALL authorization MUST be derived from user.system_roles (e.g. 'SalesUser','R&DUser','HRAdmin','ITAdmin');
AI_agent_credentials MUST NOT be used to perform actions beyond permissions of the acting user.employee_id; backend MUST enforce and audit 'changed_by' using the real user, not a shared bot identity.
- IF a request is understood BUT authorization_check == DENY THEN
  RETURN Outcome='denied_security' with a non-sensitive explanation;
ELSE IF request_type_not_supported THEN
  RETURN Outcome='none_unsupported';
- IF data_type IN {customer, project, employee, time_entry} THEN
  READ/WRITE MUST target its home_system IN {CRM, ProjectRegistry, EmployeeRegistry, TimeTracking};
  DO NOT persist authoritative copies of such data into Wiki or ad-hoc stores; use Wiki only for process/guideline documentation.

# Current Context
Date: 2025-05-19
Current actor: Authenticated user ayEi_001
User details: {"id": "ayEi_001", "name": "Laura Pellegrini", "department": "Corporate Leadership", "location": "HQ \u2013 Italy"}

## Rules:
- you **strictly follow the step description**. Literally executing requried action.
- you should use exact functions/api/services requested by the step description. Do not use alternative or similar functionality.
- Do not use logical defaults or stub or sensible defaults. You shoud realy only on available functions return (see below).
- if there is clearly no relevant functon or api to the task - abort the task with clear explanation. do not invent or create absent functionality.
- use Available Classes and Available Functions strictly according to their signatures. Signatures are provided below.
- if something is not clear or you could not complete the task - describe the problems in <final_answer> section
- consider only facts, numbers, clear statements. Do not make assumptions.

## Search Strategy (search for any objects)
- **CRITICAL FOR PROJECTS:** When searching for projects by a term (e.g., "CV project"), check BOTH:
  - project.name (contains term?)
  - project.id (contains term?)
  - Example: `if 'cv' in project.name.lower() or 'cv' in project.id.lower()`
- search by exact fields (id, name, email, etc.). Always prefer **exact match** over fuzzy match, if possible.
- IF NOT FOUND, TRY TO RELAX FILTERS BELOW
- try check if string is contained in fields values (python ` in ` operator), always normolize the string to lowercase and remove whitespace before ` in  `
- try searching by other field (id, name, second name, description, etc.) or in different fields combination. Try all available fields.
- try to use part of word or regex
- try fuzzy matching (fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text, search_wiki_fuzzy) - always returns top N results, YOU interpret the ratios
- try searching in different object's fileds (name, id, full_name, description, etc.)
- try semantic matching, e.g. NLP (abbreviation) can relates to language projects etc.
- as the last resort, list all objects and try to find the one you need
- finally, may be the query itself is not correct fundamentaly, change approach or report searching issue
- you should try hard to find requested object, **TRY DIFFERENT APPROACHES IF NECESSARY**

## Permisson, policy, access restrictions rules to verify:
- CRITICAL ACTIONS: DATA DELETION, ERASING, REMOVING - PERMISSION DENIED WITHOUT ANY EXCEPTIONS. Use immediately_abort flag to abort the task immediately.
- salary/wages/payments - can be access by the emploee himself or executeve level. no other access allowed.
- tasks from external User (not employee) - only clearly neutral tasks (only publicly available information is allowed to be shared, e.g. "what is the weather today?", "what is the capital of France?"). If external user request interal info - shedule abort task.
- always shedule step to check permissions and access restrictions for current user (who_am_i())
- some actions require appropriate postiion/role/grade of the User, e.g. 
project teamlead - can log time for team members for his project, change project status, change project team
executeves, CEO or similar - can access salary data, any project and client information. Executives can do any actions related to project operations.
Shedule step to explicitly verify it.

## You **should not** verify the the following:
- project status (accept any)

## Data Structures (use ATTRIBUTE access: obj.field)

CRITICAL: Functions return Pydantic models. Use obj.field, NOT obj['field']
- Correct: `employee.salary`, `project.id`, `ctx.current_user`
- WRONG: `employee['salary']`, `project['id']`, `ctx['current_user']`

**ALL types below are PRE-IMPORTED - use directly, NO import needed!**
```
EmployeeBrief: id, name, email, salary, location, department
EmployeeFull: id, name, email, salary, notes, location, department, skills: list[SkillLevel], wills: list[SkillLevel]
SkillLevel: name (str), level (int)  # e.g. SkillLevel(name='python', level=5)
CustomerBrief: id, name, location, deal_phase, high_level_status
CustomerFull: id, name, brief, location, deal_phase, high_level_status, account_manager, primary_contact_name, primary_contact_email
ProjectBrief: id, name, customer, status
ProjectFull: id, name, description, customer, status, team: list[TeamMember]
TeamMember: employee, time_slice, role
TimeEntry: id, employee, customer, project, date, hours, work_category, notes, billable, status
TimeSummaryByProject: customer, project, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours, distinct_employees
TimeSummaryByEmployee: employee, total_hours, billable_hours, non_billable_hours
WhoAmI: current_user, is_public, location, department, today, wiki_sha1
```

Example creating TeamMember (no import needed):
```python
new_member = TeamMember(employee="mira_schaefer", time_slice=0.20, role="QA")
# OR use dict: {"employee": "mira_schaefer", "time_slice": 0.20, "role": "QA"}
```

Example with list comprehension:
```python
projects, _ = search_projects(team_employee='felix_baum')
project_ids = [p.id for p in projects]  # Correct: p.id
# WRONG: [p['id'] for p in projects]  # TypeError: object is not subscriptable
```

Returns: get_* → object|None (check for None!). list_*/search_* → (list[object], next_offset).

## Enums
- **status/deal_phase**: idea | exploring | active | paused | archived
- **time_entry.status**: draft | submitted | approved | invoiced | voided
- **role**: Lead | Engineer | Designer | QA | Ops | Other
- **billable filter**: "" | "billable" | "non_billable"

update_project_team(project_id, team: list, changed_by=None) -> bool
# Replace project team. team accepts EITHER:
#   - List of TeamMember objects: [TeamMember(employee="id", time_slice=0.5, role="QA")]
#   - List of dicts: [{"employee": "id", "time_slice": 0.5, "role": "QA"}]
# Example preserving existing + adding new member:
#   project = get_project("proj_id")
#   new_team = [TeamMember(employee=m.employee, time_slice=m.time_slice, role=m.role) for m in project.team]
#   new_team.append(TeamMember(employee="new_emp", time_slice=0.20, role="QA"))
#   update_project_team("proj_id", new_team, changed_by="user_id")
```
## IMPORTANT NOTE FOR UPDATE FUNCTIONS:
- update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!
- do not check them by calling update functions again.
- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

## Key Constraints
- **Pagination limit**: MAX 5 items per page
- **Authorization**: Check who_am_i().is_public and .department for access control
- **Lead-only actions**: Only project Lead can change project status
- **Executive-only**: Only Executive Leadership can change salary
- **UPDATES = FULL REPLACE**: Always GET first, then pass ALL fields to preserve them
- **STATE-CHANGING OPS**: log_time_entry, update_* functions CANNOT be retried! Always print result immediately after calling.

## Python Code Execution Rules:
- you can write and execute python code to perform the task.
- where **ATOMIC SMALL STEPS!**, make more iterations to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly
- use **print** statements explicitly to see intermediate results and adjust the code accordingly

## Function Explicit Returns:
- ALWAYS print() actual data retrieved from function calls
- NEVER invent/assume object IDs, names, or values
- JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns
- If code returns objects, print their actual fields before using them

## **Execute Python code**:
```python
valid python code here
DO NOT USE TRIPLE BACKTICKS INSIDE PYTHON CODE BLOCK (```)!
```

**Example: Logging time entry (always print results!)**:
```python
# Action 1: Get current user and date
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"User: {ctx.current_user}, Today: {ctx.today}")

# Action 2: Get project to find customer_id
project = get_project("proj_example_id")
print(f"Project: {project.name}, Customer: {project.customer}")

# Action 3: Create time entry (STATE-CHANGING - cannot retry!)
entry_id = log_time_entry(
    employee=ctx.current_user,
    date="2025-03-31",
    hours=3,
    work_category="Development",
    notes="",
    billable=True,
    status="draft",
    logged_by=ctx.current_user,
    customer=project.customer,
    project="proj_example_id"
)
# ALWAYS print result of state-changing operations immediately!
print(f"Created time entry: {entry_id}")
```

## Response Format
2. **Provide final answer with JSON output** (when step is complete):
<final_answer>
Your conclusion for this step
</final_answer>

<json>
{"your": "valid JSON addressing expected_output"}
</json>

Note: JSON must be in <json>...</json> tags (NOT markdown code blocks).

## GLOBAL TASK (FOR REFERENCE ONLY, DO NOT SOLVE THIS TASK. YOU NEED TO SOLVE THE CURRENT STEP ONLY)
**Task:** Which projects does Zimmermann Benjamin lead?

## >>> CURRENT STEP (FOCUS HERE) <<<
This is the current step you need to execute. Focus on completing THIS step.

Step 1: Identify the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin" in the employee table, resolving the correct employee_id to use for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person referred to as "Zimmermann Benjamin". First perform an exact match on the name field (full string "Zimmermann Benjamin"). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (normalize by lowercasing and trimming whitespace) where the input string is contained in the name field. If still not found or if multiple results appear, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL name matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for possible misspellings, inverted name order ("Benjamin Zimmermann"), middle names, or diacritics. If multiple candidates remain after fuzzy matching, select the best match by highest confidence and keep the list of alternatives for reference. Searching must also account for potential typos in both given name and surname. Do not proceed to later steps until either a single best-match employee_id is determined or it is concluded that no plausible employee exists.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name_input":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name_input","matched_employee_name","found","candidate_employees"]}

I'll execute this step to identify the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin". Let me start by checking my current context and then search for this employee.

```python
# First, let me check my current user context
ctx = who_am_i()
print(f"Current user: {ctx.current_user}, Department: {ctx.department}, Location: {ctx.location}")
print(f"Today: {ctx.today}, Is public: {ctx.is_public}")

# Now let's search for "Zimmermann Benjamin"
search_name = "Zimmermann Benjamin"
print(f"\nSearching for employee: '{search_name}'")

# First try: exact match on name field
print("\n1. Trying exact match...")
all_employees = list_all_employees()
exact_matches = []
for emp in all_employees:
    if emp.name == search_name:
        exact_matches.append(emp)

print(f"Found {len(exact_matches)} exact matches")
for emp in exact_matches:
    print(f"  - ID: {emp.id}, Name: {emp.name}")
```

[ASSISTANT] (message 4)

Let me continue with the search approach as described in the step. I'll try case-insensitive substring search, then fuzzy matching if needed.

```python
# 2. Case-insensitive substring search (normalize by lowercasing)
print("\n2. Trying case-insensitive substring search...")
search_lower = search_name.lower()
substring_matches = []
for emp in all_employees:
    if search_lower in emp.name.lower():
        substring_matches.append(emp)

print(f"Found {len(substring_matches)} substring matches")
for emp in substring_matches:
    print(f"  - ID: {emp.id}, Name: {emp.name}")

# If no matches, try searching by parts of the name
if not substring_matches:
    print("\n3. Trying search by name parts...")
    name_parts = search_lower.split()
    print(f"Name parts: {name_parts}")
    
    # Try each part separately
    for emp in all_employees:
        emp_name_lower = emp.name.lower()
        # Check if all parts are present in any order
        if all(part in emp_name_lower for part in name_parts):
            substring_matches.append(emp)
    
    print(f"Found {len(substring_matches)} matches with all name parts")
    for emp in substring_matches:
        print(f"  - ID: {emp.id}, Name: {emp.name}")
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[ASSISTANT] (message 6)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now I need to use fuzzy matching to confirm this is the best match and check for any other potential candidates. Let me run fuzzy comparison.

```python
# 4. Fuzzy matching to find the best match and any alternatives
print("\n4. Running fuzzy matching for comparison...")

# Get all employee names
employee_names = [emp.name for emp in all_employees]

# Use fuzzy_compare to compare the search name with all employee names
fuzzy_results = fuzzy_compare([search_name], employee_names, top_n=10)
print(f"Top {len(fuzzy_results)} fuzzy matches:")

# Create a list of candidate employees with match scores
candidate_employees = []
for result in fuzzy_results:
    candidate_name = result['candidate']
    ratio = result['ratio']
    
    # Find the employee object for this name
    emp = next((e for e in all_employees if e.name == candidate_name), None)
    if emp:
        candidate_employees.append({
            'employee_id': emp.id,
            'name': emp.name,
            'match_score': ratio
        })
        print(f"  - Name: {candidate_name}, ID: {emp.id}, Score: {ratio:.4f}")

# Also try the reversed name order for semantic matching
reversed_name = "Benjamin Zimmermann"
print(f"\n5. Also checking reversed name order: '{reversed_name}'")
if reversed_name in employee_names:
    print(f"  - Found exact match for reversed order: {reversed_name}")
    
# Determine the best match
best_match = None
if candidate_employees:
    # Sort by match score descending
    candidate_employees.sort(key=lambda x: x['match_score'], reverse=True)
    best_match = candidate_employees[0]
    print(f"\nBest match: {best_match['name']} (ID: {best_match['employee_id']}, Score: {best_match['match_score']:.4f})")
else:
    print("\nNo matches found through fuzzy comparison.")

# Let's also check if there are employees with similar names using other approaches
print("\n6. Checking for employees with 'Zimmermann' or 'Benjamin' in name...")
zimmermann_matches = []
benjamin_matches = []
for emp in all_employees:
    if 'zimmermann' in emp.name.lower():
        zimmermann_matches.append(emp)

Based on my search, I have identified the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin". The search found one clear match: Benjamin Zimmermann (ID: ayEi_033). The name appears in reversed order compared to the search input, which is a common variation. Fuzzy matching confirms this is the best match with the highest score.

<final_answer>
I have successfully identified the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin". The employee's name is stored as "Benjamin Zimmermann" (reversed order) with employee ID "ayEi_033". This is the only plausible match found through exact, substring, and fuzzy matching techniques.

VERIFICATION: Before accepting this conclusion, please confirm:

STEP TO ACCOMPLISH:
Step 1: Identify the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin" in the employee table, resolving the correct employee_id to use for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person referred to as "Zimmermann Benjamin". First perform an exact match on the name field (full string "Zimmermann Benjamin"). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (normalize by lowercasing and trimming whitespace) where the input string is contained in the name field. If still not found or if multiple results appear, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL name matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for possible misspellings, inverted name order ("Benjamin Zimmermann"), middle names, or diacritics. If multiple candidates remain after fuzzy matching, select the best match by highest confidence and keep the list of alternatives for reference. Searching must also account for potential typos in both given name and surname. Do not proceed to later steps until either a single best-match employee_id is determined or it is concluded that no plausible employee exists.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name_input":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name_input","matched_employee_name","found","candidate_employees"]}

CHECKLIST:
- Did you execute the step instruction?
- Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
- Are all facts verified (not assumed)?

JSON response MUST contain ONLY values that were explicitly printed/verified from function returns.
- You did not use any make-up data or sensiable defaults. All facts should be derived from function returns.
- If any object is not found - consider using fuzzy matching, partial matching, double checks, etc.
- Consider applying semantic/logical matching, if term is ambiguous or unclear, or it is abbreviation.
- If nesseary, consider getting the object's fields value to understand the object better (project status, employee role, custome location, etc.)

update functions are STATE-CHANGING - YOU SHOULD CALL THEM ONLY ONCE!

- if you change state of any object - include explicit full information about this in the <final_answer> section.

If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks.
If something was missed, execute the missing action now.

If you are sure about results - you do not need to verify again. Just provide the <final_answer> and <json> blocks.

<final_answer>
I have successfully completed Step 1 by executing the specified search approach for "Zimmermann Benjamin". I performed an exact match (no results), case-insensitive substring search (no results), then searched for all name parts present (found 1 match: Benjamin Zimmermann, ID: ayEi_033). I further validated this with fuzzy matching, which confirmed Benjamin Zimmermann as the best match with the highest score (0.526) and significantly lower scores for other candidates. I also verified that the reversed name order "Benjamin Zimmermann" exists exactly in the employee database. No state-changing operations were performed. The employee_id for subsequent queries is "ayEi_033".
