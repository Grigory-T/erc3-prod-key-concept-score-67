Step 1: Identify the employee record for "Zimmermann Benjamin" in the employee table, resolving the correct employee_id to use for subsequent queries.
Approach: Query the employee table to find the record corresponding to the person referred to as "Zimmermann Benjamin". First perform an exact match on the name field (full string "Zimmermann Benjamin"). If no exact match is found, progressively relax the search: use case-insensitive substring search (normalize by lowercasing and trimming whitespace) where the input string is contained in the name field. If still not found or if multiple results appear, use FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL name matching (e.g., fuzzy_compare, fuzzy_find_in_text) to account for possible misspellings, inverted name order ("Benjamin Zimmermann"), middle names, or diacritics. If multiple candidates remain after fuzzy matching, select the best match by highest confidence and keep the list of alternatives for reference. Searching must also account for potential typos in both given name and surname. Do not proceed to later steps until either a single best-match employee_id is determined or it is concluded that no plausible employee exists.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":["string","null"]},"employee_name_input":{"type":"string"},"matched_employee_name":{"type":["string","null"]},"found":{"type":"boolean"},"candidate_employees":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"employee_id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"match_score":{"type":"number"}},"required":["employee_id","name","match_score"]}}},"required":["employee_id","employee_name_input","matched_employee_name","found","candidate_employees"]}
