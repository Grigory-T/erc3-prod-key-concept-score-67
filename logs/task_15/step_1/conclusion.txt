I have successfully completed Step 1 by executing the specified search approach for "Zimmermann Benjamin". I performed an exact match (no results), case-insensitive substring search (no results), then searched for all name parts present (found 1 match: Benjamin Zimmermann, ID: ayEi_033). I further validated this with fuzzy matching, which confirmed Benjamin Zimmermann as the best match with the highest score (0.526) and significantly lower scores for other candidates. I also verified that the reversed name order "Benjamin Zimmermann" exists exactly in the employee database. No state-changing operations were performed. The employee_id for subsequent queries is "ayEi_033".
