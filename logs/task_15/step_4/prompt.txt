Step 4: Fetch project details for all projects where the employee is a Lead, to answer which projects Zimmermann Benjamin leads.
Approach: Using the list of project_ids obtained in Step 3, query the project table for each of these identifiers. Use exact matching on the id field. If needed (for example, in case of inconsistent identifiers), allow a secondary FUZZY and SEMANTIC / LOGICAL search on project id or name, but always prefer exact id matches when available. For each matching project, retrieve at minimum the id, name, status, and customer_id, and optionally other non-sensitive fields such as description if useful. Assemble these records into a list that represents all projects led by the identified employee. If the list of project_ids is empty, return an empty array to indicate that the employee does not lead any projects.
Expected Output: {"type":"object","properties":{"projects":{"type":"array","items":{"type":"object","properties":{"id":{"type":"string"},"name":{"type":"string"},"status":{"type":"string"},"customer_id":{"type":["string","null"]}},"required":["id","name","status","customer_id"]}},"total_projects":{"type":"integer"}},"required":["projects","total_projects"]}
