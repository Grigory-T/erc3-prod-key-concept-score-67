I have executed Step 4 exactly as instructed. I used the list of project_ids obtained in Step 3: ["proj_novaauto_chassis_line", "proj_danubesteel_bridge_steel_system"]. For each project_id, I queried the project table using exact matching on the id field via the get_project() function. Both projects were found successfully. For each matching project, I retrieved the required fields: id, name, status, and customer_id. All facts were explicitly verified from function returns - I printed each project's details after retrieval. No data was made up or assumed. No state-changing operations were performed - only read queries. The employee (Benjamin Zimmermann, ID: ayEi_033) leads 2 projects.
