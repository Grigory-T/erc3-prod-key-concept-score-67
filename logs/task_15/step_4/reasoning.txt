We are given the list of project_ids from Step 3: ["proj_novaauto_chassis_line", "proj_danubesteel_bridge_steel_system"]
 We need to fetch project details for each of these projects.
 Approach: Use `get_project` for each project_id to get the full project details.
 Since we have exactly two project_ids, we can call `get_project` for each and then extract the required fields.
 We must use exact matching on the id field.
 We are to return for each project: id, name, status, and customer_id.
 Note: `get_project` returns a ProjectFull object, which has fields: id, name, description, customer, status, team.
 We are only interested in id, name, status, and customer (which is the customer_id).
 Let's do it step by step.

We have successfully fetched the details for both projects where Benjamin Zimmermann (ayEi_033) is the Lead.
 The output matches the expected format: a list of projects with id, name, status, and customer_id.
 We also note the total number of projects (2).
 We'll now prepare the final answer in the required JSON format.

We are given two project IDs from Step 3: "proj_novaauto_chassis_line" and "proj_danubesteel_bridge_steel_system".
 We have already fetched the project details for these two IDs using `get_project` and printed the results.
 The checklist asks:
   - Did you execute the step instruction? 
     Yes, we used the list of project_ids and queried the project table for each by exact id match.
   - Is there any action you skipped or assumed?
     We did not skip any action. We fetched both projects and retrieved the required fields: id, name, status, customer_id.
   - Are all facts verified (not assumed)?
     We printed the results from the function calls, so the facts are verified.

 However, note that the step description says:
   "For each matching project, retrieve at minimum the id, name, status, and customer_id, and optionally other non-sensitive fields such as description if useful."

 We have retrieved the required fields. We did not retrieve the description, but it is optional and not required in the expected output.

 The expected output requires an array of projects with exactly the properties: id, name, status, customer_id.

 We have two projects, and we have extracted these properties for each.

 The code execution result shows that we have successfully fetched both projects.

 Therefore, we can produce the JSON output as required.

 However, let's double-check by printing the project objects again to ensure we have the correct fields.

 But note: the code already printed the required fields and stored them in a list.

 Since the code execution result is already provided, we can see that the data is correct.

 Let's just verify that the project IDs we have are the ones from Step 3 and that we didn't miss any.

 We are given two project IDs and we fetched both. The output shows two projects.

 We can also consider if there might be more projects where the employee is a lead but with a different role string (e.g., "lead" vs "Lead")?
 Step 3 already handled that by checking the role exactly as 'Lead'. We are using the same project IDs.

 Therefore, we are confident.

 Now, we produce the final answer and JSON.

 However, note that the checklist says: "If complete, repeat BOTH your <final_answer> AND <json> blocks."

 We already provided a final_answer and json in the previous response. But since the verification step asks, we will provide them again.

 Let's write the final answer and JSON with the verified data.
